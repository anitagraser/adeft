Welcome to deft's documentation!
================================

Deft is a utility for disambiguating acronyms and other abbreviations for genes
in biological texts. It is based on a reimplementation of the
`Acromine <http://www.chokkan.org/research/acromine/>`_ system developed by the `NaCTeM <http://www.nactem.ac.uk/index.php>`_ at the University of Manchester.
It makes use of pattern matching and machine learning to disambiguate abbreviations
based on text context.
