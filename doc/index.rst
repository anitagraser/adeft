Welcome to adeft's documentation!
================================

adeft (Acromine based Disambiguation of Entities from Text context) is a utility for building models to disambiguate acronyms and other abbreviations of biological terms in the scientific literature. It makes use of an implementation of the
`Acromine <http://www.chokkan.org/research/acromine/>`_ algorithm developed by the `NaCTeM <http://www.nactem.ac.uk/index.php>`_ at the University of Manchester to identify possible longform expansions for shortforms based on their text context.
It allows users to build disambiguation models to disambiguate shortforms based on their text context. A growing number of pretrained disambiguation models are publically available to download through adeft.
