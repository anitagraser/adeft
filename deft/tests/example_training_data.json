{"train": ["These results indicate that activation of the beta-cell IR by L-783,281 augments insulin release in the presence of a stimulatory glucose concentration. At nonstimulatory glucose concentrations, activation of the beta-cell IR may affect mechanisms related to the frequency of the insulin pulses.", "The IR-A isoform is predominantly expressed in fetal tissues and malignant cells and binds IGF-II with high affinity. We previously observed that IRs are overexpressed in thyroid cancer cells; now we evaluated whether these cells preferentially express IR-A and produce IGF-II, which would activate a growth-promoting autocrine loop. The IR content ranged 6.0-52.6 ng/100 microg cell membrane protein in thyroid cancer primary cultures (n = 8) and permanent cell lines (n = 6) vs. 1.2-1.7 in normal thyroid cells (n = 11 primary cultures; P < 0.0001). IR-A isoform relative abundance ranged from 36-79% in cancer cells (with the highest values in undifferentiated cancers) vs. 27-39% in normal cells. IGF-II caused IR autophosphorylation with an ED(50) of 1.5-40.0 nM in cancer cells vs. more than 100 nM in normal cells; IGF-II affinity correlated with the relative abundance of IR-A (r = 0.628; P < 0.0001). In conclusion, malignant thyrocytes, especially when poorly differentiated, produce IGF-II and overexpress IR, predominantly as IGF-II-sensitive isoform A.", "However, cells lacking ATM function exhibit both a defective G(2) checkpoint and a prolonged G(2) arrest after IR, suggesting the existence of different types of G(2) arrest. The first of these G(2)/M checkpoints occurs early after IR, is very transient, is ATM dependent and dose independent (between 1 and 10 Gy), and represents the failure of cells which had been in G(2) at the time of irradiation to progress into mitosis. In contrast, G(2)/M accumulation, typically assessed by propidium iodide staining, begins to be measurable only several hours after IR, is ATM independent, is dose dependent, and represents the accumulation of cells that had been in earlier phases of the cell cycle at the time of exposure to radiation. G(2)/M accumulation after IR is not affected by the early G(2)/M checkpoint and is enhanced in cells lacking the IR-induced S-phase checkpoint, such as those lacking Nbs1 or Brca1 function, because of a prolonged G(2) arrest of cells that had been in S phase at the time of irradiation.", "IR decreased State 3 and RCI in all groups using either substrate.", "We have examined the role of p53 in co-regulation of the DDR and tissue regeneration following IR damage in The imaginal discs of Imaginal discs have long been a powerful experimental system for study of organ development and regeneration. In the DDR, the DNA damage sensor Ataxia Telangiectasia mutated (ATM) recruits and phosphorylates repair proteins to the DNA break site ( Previously, we found that In addition to RH-induced tissue damage, blastema formation induced by ectopic expression of Wg requires p53, suggesting that p53 may have a general role in tissue repair ( We report here that p53 is also critical for disc regeneration following IR, suggesting that p53 universally promotes regeneration of damaged imaginal discs. Like expression of RH genes, expression of p53 from an early larval stage led to rapid cell death when in the absence of P35 (data not shown) ( To test the generality of the p53 requirement during regeneration, we examined wing discs after induction of tissue damage by IR. We treated In anterior wing disc cells, which did not express P35, C3 activation rapidly spiked after IR and then declined ( In RH-damaged tissue, a non-apoptotic function of the apical caspase Dronc is required to activate p53 ( To follow the IR response of the disc in real time we did not express the caspase inhibitor P35 in our subsequent experiments. IR at 96 hours AEL induced a significant developmental delay of To determine how IR affected the formation of adults we examined the morphology and eclosion rates of adult flies that had been IR-treated at 96 hours AEL. The vast majority of IR-treated In striking contrast, although all IR-treated IR-induced DNA damage is rapidly recognized by disc cells and the DDR is initiated, leading to a DNA repair program and apoptosis mediated by p53 ( Cells in C3 activation and TUNEL-positive cells were largely absent from The major proliferative phase of imaginal disc development occurs during the larval stage and is prolonged during tissue repair ( We first followed growth in our wildtype control strain. During the first 12 hours after IR, wing discs from By contrast, growth of We then examined cell proliferation at 6 or 12 hour intervals in the regenerating discs. This method avoids the stochastic nature of IR damage, and provides a powerful method of measuring compensatory cell proliferation stimulated by cellular loss or damage. Our experiments indicate that IR induces two p53-dependent processes that contribute to disc regeneration: rapid induction of massive apoptosis, and slowed progression of the developmental clock to delay PP, allowing cell division - at a developmentally programmed pace - to replace lost cells. Since disc pattern formation and disc growth (increase in disc size) are tightly coupled, a delay in patterning might be expected in wing discs from IR-treated larvae. We therefore tracked the patterning process during regeneration by examining the expression of several patterning genes in wing discs from larvae treated with IR. A number of genes required for sensory organ precursor (SOP) and vein formation are initially expressed in mid-third instar wing discs, including In unirradiated Our finding that wandering stage wing discs from IR-treated We then examined pupal wing discs from The additional cell proliferation in pupae helped to explain how wings of control flies irradiated during L3 reached an appropriate final size. In contrast, despite similar extensions of the pupal stage ( In contrast, cells with DNA damage persisted in the By 38 hours APF, IR-treated wing disc cells from In this work, we make several key findings about imaginal disc regeneration. First, we find that both RH- and IR- induced tissue damage require p53 function for regeneration, but each process utilizes a different genetic mechanism to activate p53, suggesting that p53 plays a universal role in regulating regeneration. They add to previous work indicating that a continuum of events follows IR that culminates in regeneration of damaged tissue and survival of the animal ( We find that in Cell division continues beyond the normal cessation time in both our wildtype strain and the p53 mutants. This is exacerbated by the absence of apoptosis immediately after IR in the Our results are strikingly similar to observations made in mouse and human cells. In addition to its role in the initiation of regeneration, our results argue that p53 is responsible for regulating the expression of a signal(s) from discs that prolongs larval development to allow regeneration after either RH or IR damage. Double labeling of wing discs with antibodies against both \u03b3-H2Av and \u03b3-H2AX showed complete overlap of expression in Animals were given 40 Gy IR at 96 hours AEL. Animals were given 40 Gy IR at 96 hours AEL. Time of dissection of irradiated animals is shown as hours following IR (bottom right of each panel). IR interrupts the normal larval and imaginal disc developmental programs to induce a stereotypical cell and tissue repair response.", "We hypothesised that metabolomic profiling would identify biomarkers predicting changes in IR with weight loss. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and change in HOMA-IR with weight loss (\u0394HOMA-IR) were calculated. Principal components analysis (PCA) and mixed models adjusted for race, sex, baseline weight, and amount of weight loss were used; findings were validated in an independent cohort of patients ( Mean weight loss was 8.67\u00b14.28 kg; mean \u0394HOMA-IR was \u22120.80\u00b11.73, range \u221228.9 to 4.82). Baseline PCA-derived factor 3 (branched chain amino acids [BCAAs] and associated catabolites) correlated with baseline HOMA-IR ( A cluster of metabolites comprising BCAAs and related analytes predicts improvement in HOMA-IR independent of the amount of weight lost. These results may help identify individuals most likely to benefit from moderate weight loss and elucidate novel mechanisms of IR in obesity. IR and type 2 diabetes mellitus are strongly associated with increasing body weight. Indeed, the adverse health consequences of overweight/obesity occur primarily as a result of effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors including type 2 diabetes mellitus and IR. For example, a mean weight loss of only 5.5 kg in overweight and obese adults with insulin resistance reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus by 58% [ The Weight Loss Maintenance (WLM) Study was a randomised clinical trial that included an intensive behavioural weight loss phase followed by randomisation to one of three maintenance strategies [ The WLM study was a multi-centre, randomised trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00054925) to determine the effects of two weight loss maintenance interventions compared with a usual care control group [ From participants who were randomised in phase II ( The current analysis was approved by both the Steering Committee of the WLM Collaborative Research Group and the Duke Institutional Review Board (IRB). Use of stored WLM data and samples was approved by the IRB of each WLM clinical site and the coordinating centre. In this cohort, morbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were studied before and 1 month after gastric bypass surgery ( We measured 45 acylcarnitines and 15 amino acids by tandem mass spectrometry (ESM IR was measured by the HOMA-IR index calculation as we have done previously [ Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the large number of correlated metabolites into clusters of fewer uncorrelated factors, as has been done previously [ As all analyses were exploratory in nature and given the co-linearity of the metabolites, two-sided Several clinical characteristics were associated with \u0394HOMA-IR in univariate analyses ( PCA identified 13 factors composed of correlated metabolites ( Baseline BCAA factor levels were correlated with baseline HOMA-IR ( In the New York validation cohort, in the combined gastric bypass surgery and matched diet groups, PCA also identified a factor composed of the branched chain and other amino acids (leucine/isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, alanine, ornithine), similar to the BCAA factor identified in the WLM cohort. In the validation cohort, the BCAA factor, but not weight loss, also predicted \u0394HOMA-IR ( BCAAs are found in dietary proteins; hence, differences in baseline peripheral blood BCAA levels (and subsequent improvement in IR with weight loss) could be reflective of differences in dietary BCAA intake. BCAA intake was weakly correlated with blood BCAA levels at baseline ( Our previous work in a small cohort has shown that BCAA levels decrease with weight loss [ In this sub-study of the WLM trial, we have used targeted metabolomic profiling to identify a biosignature reporting on BCAA metabolism that is associated with IR in non-diabetic overweight/obese individuals and, more importantly, predicts improvement in IR with moderate weight loss independent of the amount of weight lost. In fact, in our study, the amount of weight lost was only modestly correlated with the degree of improvement in IR. These results could help identify individuals who would more likely benefit from moderate weight loss and potentially elucidate novel mechanisms of IR in obese individuals. Increased BCAA catabolism, driven by higher levels of these analytes in the blood, may explain the higher levels of glutamate, alanine and proline that comprise factor 3 (see These results are particularly provocative in light of our previous studies implicating BCAAs in IR. We have shown that a similar cluster of BCAAs and related catabolites distinguishes lean from obese individuals and is associated with IR [ More recently, we have reported on changes in metabolites occurring in response to bariatric surgery or dietary intervention [ The clinical and biological implications of our results are as follows. While HOMA-IR is a strong marker of insulin resistance, it is not used clinically and remains primarily an epidemiological research tool. Importantly, BCAAs and related metabolites were unique among a much larger and more diverse set of metabolites evaluated in predicting change in HOMA-IR, and therefore suggest a potential mechanism for the heterogeneity in health benefits obtained from weight loss. The WLM population consisted of non-diabetic individuals, and hence these results have implications for understanding IR in the absence of overt type 2 diabetes mellitus. Baseline factor 3 levels were strongly associated with \u0394HOMA-IR in a multivariable model. However, given the strong co-linearity of baseline factor 3 levels with baseline HOMA-IR ( Although HOMA-IR is a commonly used epidemiological tool for assessment of IR and \u03b2-cell function, and has been shown to correlate with more complicated and costly \u2018gold standard\u2019 measures of IR (i.e. euglycaemic\u2013hyperinsulinaemic clamp), it may not perform as well in certain subgroups [ In conclusion, a metabolite signature representing BCAA catabolism is correlated with IR and predicts improvement in IR with moderate weight loss, independent of the amount of weight lost. These results may help identify individuals most likely to benefit from moderate weight loss and elucidate novel mechanisms of IR in obesity. those metabolites with an absolute value of the factor load \u22650.4 for that factor), the eigenvalue for the factor and the variance for the factor PCA-derived factors and association with \u0394HOMA Adjusted for sex, education, income, entry weight, change in weight, HEI (Healthy Eating Index) Per 1 unit change in factor level Mean levels of baseline HOMA-IR, 6 month HOMA-IR and \u0394HOMA-IR stratified by quartiles of factor 3 Values are mean \u00b1 SD PCA-derived factor consisting of the BCAAs valine, leucine and isoleucine; the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine; and other amino acids (alanine, proline, methionine, glutamate/glutamine and ornithine)", "Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling through human insulin receptor isoform A (IR-A) contributes to tumorigenesis and intrinsic resistance to anti-IGF1R therapy. In the present study, we (a) developed quantitative TaqMan real time-PCR-based assays (qRT-PCR) to measure human insulin receptor isoforms with high specificity, (b) evaluated isoform expression levels in molecularly-defined breast cancer subtypes, and (c) identified the IR-A:IR-B mRNA ratio as a potential biomarker guiding patient stratification for anti-IGF therapies. mRNA expression levels of IR-A and IR-B were measured in 42 primary breast cancers and 19 matched adjacent normal tissues with TaqMan qRT-PCR assays. The relationship between the IR-A:IR-B ratio and cancer subtype, as well as markers of proliferation were characterized. The mRNA expression levels of IR-A in the breast tumors were similar to those observed in the adjacent normal tissues, while the mRNA levels of IR-B were significantly decreased in tumors. The IR-A:IR-B ratio was significantly higher in luminal B breast cancer than in luminal A. Strong concordance between the IR-A:IR-B ratio and the composite Oncotype DX proliferation score was observed for stratifying the latter two breast cancer subtypes. The reduction in IR-B expression is the key to the altered IR-A:IR-B ratio observed in breast cancer. The IR-A:IR-B ratio may have biomarker utility in guiding a patient stratification strategy for an anti-IGF therapeutic. IR-A differs from IR-B by the exclusion of exon 11, which encodes a 12 amino acid fragment (residues 717\u2013728) of the insulin receptor \u03b1-subunit The fine regulation of the IR-A:IR-B expression ratio may be rendered more complex by coexpression of the cognate IGF1R, which may form hybrid receptors with IRs. Several studies have demonstrated the existence of IR-A/IGF1R hybrid receptors. These hybrid receptors are heterodimers comprised of an \u03b1\u03b2 chain from the IR and an \u03b1\u03b2 chain from the IGF1R, both in normal As a key signaling component of the IGF pathway, IGF1R is the target of several investigational agents in clinical development. These agents were developed to specifically inhibit IGF1R while sparing IR-A due to concerns that co-targeting IGF1R and IR would result in unacceptable toxicity As therapeutic strategies for co-targeting IGF1R and IR-A move forward in clinical development, evaluating IR-A levels in clinical tumor samples becomes critical for identifying the most appropriate population to receive IGF-targeted therapy. To date, the most common method to specifically measure human IR-A and IR-B expression has been described by Frasca and colleagues Forty-two grade I to III infiltrating breast ductal carcinomas were purchased from ILSbio (Chestertown, MD). Full-length mRNA transcript sequences for the IR-A (NM_001079817) and IR-B (NM_000208) isoforms were retrieved from the NCBI Reference Sequences database. For the IR-A assay design, we targeted the exon 10/12 junction region for the gene specific probe; the exon 10 coding region for the forward primer pairs; and the exon 12 coding regions for the reverse primer pairs. For the IR-B assay design, we targeted the exon 11 interior coding region for the gene specific probe; exon 11/12 junction for the forward primer pairs; and exon 12 for the reverse primer pairs. Sequences for all primer/probe combinations are as follows: IR-A: The sequence of the probe is The sequence of the forward primer is The sequence of the reverse primer is IR-B: The sequence of the probe is 5\u2032 The sequence of the forward primer is The sequence of reverse primer is Commercially available cDNA clones that contain the full-length cDNA clones of IR-A (cloned in pCMV6-XL4) and IR-B (cloned in pCMV6-XL5) were purchased from OriGene Technologies, Inc (IR-A: SKU#. SC311328; IR-B: SKU# SC315880). The sequence verification of each IR isoform clone was conducted in-house at MedImmune. The empty plasmids pCMV6-XL4 and pCMV6-XL5 were used as negative control DNA for IR-A and IR-B assays, respectively. Reactions consisted of 5 \u00b5L of TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.5 \u00b5L of 10x Gene Expression Assay Mix, and 4.5 \u00b5L of varying copy numbers of either the IR-B or IR-A cDNA clone, for a final volume of 10 \u00b5L per well. The assays include: INSR (Assay ID: Hs00961554_m1); ESR1 (Assay ID: Hs00174860_m1); PGR (Assay ID: Hs01556707_m1); ERBB2 (HER2, Assay ID: Hs01001580_m1); tumor proliferation genes (Pike S et al 2004): BIRC5 (Survivin, Assay ID:Hs00153353_m1), AURKA (STK15, Assay ID:Hs01582073_m1), CCNB1 (Assay ID: Hs00259126_m1), MKI67 (Assay ID: Hs01032443_m1), MYBL2 (Assay ID: Hs00942543_m1); and reference genes: ACTB (Hs99999903_m1), GUSB (AssyID:Hs99999908_m1), GAPDH (Assay ID: Hs99999905_m1), RPLP0 (Assay ID: Hs99999902_m1), TFRC (Assay ID: Hs99999911_m1). The first classification method utilized a published PAM50-gene shrunken centroid classifier Probe sensitivity was tested by performing IR-A or IR-B TaqMan qRT-PCR assays starting with 100 pg template stock solutions of IR-A or IR-B (approximately 10 Probe sensitivity was tested by performing IR-A or IR-B TaqMan qRT-PCR assays with a serial dilution of approximately 10 The specificity of the assays was also assessed by testing the IR-A assay in the presence of the IR-B DNA template or, alternatively, the IR-B assay in presence of the IR-A DNA template. In order to assess the IR-A and IR-B mRNA expression in breast cancer, 42 primary breast tissue samples that are ER+, PR+ and HER2-, and 19 matched normal adjacent breast tissues were evaluated. Random hexamer primed cDNAs were pre-amplified and assayed for expression levels of total IR, IR-A, and IR-B transcripts by TaqMan qRT-PCR (Fluidigm). The results are shown in TaqMan gene expression assay determined fold change differentials (log We calculated the proportion of IR-A relative to total insulin receptor composition (IR-A + IR-B) in matched tumor and normal pairs as determined by a 2 Within sample proportion of insulin receptor isoform-A (IR-A) relative to total insulin receptor composition (ie, IR-A + IR-B) as determined by 2 In order to assess the mRNA transcript ratios of IR-A and IR-B, we calculated \u0394Ct differentials of IR-A and IR-B in normal and primary breast tumor samples. The \u0394Ct differential (IR-B \u0394Ct\u2013IR-A \u0394Ct) values were calculated for all samples utilizing the within-sample reference gene panel (average Ct) for normalization purposes. The mean IR-A:IR-B \u0394Ct \u00b195% CI were -0.20\u00b10.27 and 1.81\u00b10.31 in the normal (n = 19) and primary tumors (n = 42), respectively. A two-tailed Welch's t-test analysis identified a significant difference between normal and tumor samples in relation to observed IR-A:IR-B \u0394Ct ( (A) Calculated \u0394Ct differentials of insulin receptor isoforms IR-A and IR-B in primary breast cancer samples: normal (n = 19) and tumor (n = 42) breast samples. (B) Calculated \u0394Ct differentials of insulin receptor isoforms IR-A and IR-B breast cancer samples from qPCR cDNA array: normal (n = 15), breast cancer cDNA panels (n = 168), and breast tumors from these cDNA panels with >2-fold estrogen receptor over-expression (n = 83). \u0394Ct differentials (IR-B \u0394Ct - IR-A \u0394Ct) values were calculated for all samples utilizing the within-sample reference gene panel (average Ct) for normalization purposes. A two-tailed Welch's t-test analysis identified a significant difference between normal and tumor samples in relation to observed IR-A:IR-B \u0394Ct differential ( To further validate the above results, we assessed mRNA expression ratios of IR-A and IR-B in an additional breast cancer tissue panel. Equal amounts of cDNA were pre-amplified and assayed for expression levels of IR-A, IR-B, and ER by TaqMan qRT-PCR (Fluidigm). The \u0394Ct differential (IR-B \u0394Ct\u2013IR-A \u0394Ct) was calculated for all samples utilizing the within-sample reference gene panel (ACTB, GUSB, and GAPDH) for normalization purposes. The results are shown in Linear regression analysis of the relationship between calculated IR-A:IR-B \u0394Ct differential (X axis) and a pooled panel of proliferation markers (AURKA, BIRC5, CCNB1, KI67, and MYBL2) (Y axis). AURKA, BIRC5, CCNB1, MKI67 and MYBL2 are well characterized genes involved in breast cancer proliferation Using mRNA expression profiles, ER+ breast cancers can be further classified by hierarchical cluster analysis into luminal-A and luminal-B subtypes To address this question we conducted whole genome array analysis on 40 ER+/PR+ and HER2- negative breast tumors and 15 normal breast samples. We initially utilized a published PAM50-gene shrunken centroid classifier Scatter plot representation of calculated IR-A:IR-B \u0394Ct differentials with regard to sample subtype (normal, luminal-A, or luminal-B) classification determined by a shrunken centroid classifier-based methodology (A) and a hierarchical clustering analysis (B). IR-A:IR-B \u0394Ct differentials in the normal, luminal-A and luminal-B were then compared. However, the overall concordance between the results from comparisons of the IR-A:IR-B \u0394Ct differential with both the published PAM50 classifier and an independent gene selection and clustering method further supports our observation that the IR-A:IR-B ratio is significantly increased in the luminal-B subtype of breast cancer. We have described specific TaqMan qRT-PCR-based assays that accurately measure the mRNA levels of human IR isoforms IR-A and IR-B. In the absence of specific reagents to quantitatively distinguish the two isoforms, previous research utilized an RT-PCR/gel quantification protocol to distinguish IR-A and IR-B and measure their relative amounts in normal and cancer tissues Over-expression of hybrid IGF1R and IR-A receptors has been reported in breast cancer The functional consequences of an altered IR-A:IR-B ratio on cancer progression may also be mediated, in part, by changes in receptor dimerization patterns and the subsequent effect on cell signaling pathways. An increase in the relative abundance of IR-A might significantly increase formation of IGF1R and IR-A hybrid receptors, IR-A/IR-B heterodimers, and IR-A homodimers in breast cancer tissues. These changes in dimerization patterns could result in an increased number of binding sites for IGFs, leading to increases in mitogenic signaling in breast cancer cells Gene expression profiling studies have consistently revealed biologically distinct breast cancer subtypes with different prognoses and treatment responses Previous work has shown that protein levels of the total insulin receptor are elevated in breast cancer tissue compared to normal breast tissue In summary, the specific TaqMan qRT-PCR-based assays that we developed can easily be incorporated into routine clinical practice and measure the relative abundance of IR-A and IR-B mRNAs in human tissues with high sensitivity and specificity. Studies based on these assays may provide value in evaluating the therapeutic benefit of targeting both IGF1R and IR-A pathways by inhibiting the growth factors IGF1 and IGF2, as well as potentially identifying patients more likely to respond to any anti-IGF therapy under clinical development.", "To define the role of IR in this context, we crossed neuron-specific IR knockout mice (nIR(-/-)) with Tg2576 mice, a well-established mouse model of an AD-like pathology. Here, we show that neuronal IR deficiency in Tg2576 (nIR(-/-)Tg2576) mice leads to markedly decreased A\u03b2 burden but does not rescue premature mortality of Tg2576 mice. Analyzing APP C-terminal fragments (CTF) revealed decreased \u03b1-/\u03b2-CTFs in the brains of nIR(-/-)Tg2576 mice suggesting decreased APP processing. Thus, our findings identified IR signaling as a potent regulator of A\u03b2 accumulation in vivo.", "IR was estimated using HOMA-IR index and HCV-4 load determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. HCC patients showed higher IR frequency but without significant difference from CHC (52% vs 40%, p = 0.23). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed HOMA-IR index and International Normalization Ratio independently associated with fibrosis in CHC; in HCC, HbA1c, cholesterol and bilirubin were independently associated with fibrosis. Moderate and high viral load was associated with high HOMA-IR in CHC and HCC (p < 0.001). IR is induced by HCV-4 irrespective of severity of liver disease. IR starts early in infection and facilitates progression of hepatic fibrosis and HCC development. IR is a key feature of this syndrome and a variety of potential molecular pathways by which HCV may contribute to IR have been suggested [ Recent studies have found that HCV-associated IR may cause; (i) hepatic steatosis, (ii) resistance to anti-viral treatment, (iii) hepatic fibrosis and esophageal varices, (iv) hepatocarcinogenesis and proliferation of HCC and (v) extrahepatic manifestations [ It has been reported that IR can increase the risk of developing HCC in patients with chronic HCV infection [ The focus of the study was to investigate: (i) the prevalence of IR among CHC and HCC patients and its possible role in HCC development in the context of high prevalence of HCV-4 infection and (ii) impact of other factors such as host characteristics (age, gender, etc. ), viral parameters (viral load, viral genotype), and other variables including obesity and dyslipidemia on IR and hepatic carcinogenesis.

It has been documented that obesity is an independent risk factor for IR in HCV and HCC [ iii) The number of participants in this study may not have been sufficient to reveal small differences in prevalence in the studied population In the present study, the frequency of conspicuous insulin resistance (HOMA-IR >4) was 40% among CHC patients. This finding is in agreement with Harrison and co-workers [ It is very likely that a high prevalence of diabetes in our CHC group (96%) may be a risk factor for HCC development [ Multivariate analysis showed that HOMA-IR values and INR were independently associated with fibrosis in CHC patients, but not in the HCC patient group. This is in accord with our hypothesis that early occurrence of IR may hasten progression of fibrosis to cirrhosis which may culminate in HCC development. This is consistent with recent reports, including a Japanese cohort study [ It has been reported that the mean IR index increases with stage of fibrosis and may help in differentiating fibrosis stages [ In our HCC patient group, HbA1c, triglycerides and total bilirubin levels were found to be independently associated with fibrosis. These results confirm a distinct role of diabetes in HCC development [ It is well established that IR is associated with abdominal obesity, elevated blood cholesterol and hypertension [ Multivariate analysis in the present study showed that fasting insulin and cholesterol were independent predictors for obesity. Type 2 diabetes is a major health problem in the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office (EMRO) region and many studies have established a panel of risk factors associated with IR and type 2 diabetes; family history, body fat distribution, age, gender, smoking and physical activity. Obesity and IR are strong cofactors of HCV-related liver disease and predict lack of response to treatment [ Division of patient groups using age of >57 revealed that most of our HCC patients were over 57 years in age and the number in this age group showed significant difference when compared to CHC patients (p = 0.04). In univariate analysis, IR was correlated with age in CHC patients. It has been suggested that age is associated with a decline in mitochondrial function which could contribute to IR [ Our HCC patients showed higher frequency of moderate viral load than patients with CHC infection; a result in accord with that reported by Hsu [ The association of HOMA-IR with viral load is an important finding of the study. The patient with HCV infection can present with IR due to metabolic and to viral factors; the molecular bases of these effects have been subject to intense research scrutiny though the relative importance of some of these interrelated effects to the clinical picture remains to be fully determined. Chronic inflammation as a non-specific consequence of hepatic inflammation due to HCV infection leads to IR associated with metabolic liver disease through increased levels of IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and leptin, and reduced levels of adiponectin. This will complement obesity effects which involve simulation of inflammatory mediator IkB kinase \u03b2 and phosphorylation of IRS-1 [ Multiple pathways for direct effects of the virus on IR have been identified. These include impairment of insulin signaling through stimulation of proteosomal inactivation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, viral induction of excess TNF giving enhanced production of suppressor cytokine signal proteins (SOCS) in a genotype specific manner [ Insulin resistance may be induced by HCV infection irrespective of the severity of liver disease; insulin resistance starts at an initial phase of HCV infection and facilitates the progression of fibrosis and development of HCC. In chronic hepatitis C infection, HCV viral replication Our results lay a foundation for a follow up cohort study with larger sample size and including diabetic and non-diabetic CHC patients with and without fibrosis that would have value to illustrate the role of IR as a separate metabolic factor for HCC development and enable investigation of the role of other individual metabolic signals such as adiponectin, and leptin which may have particular involvement in hepatocarcinogenesis in patients infected with HCV-4. A better understanding of IR involvement in HCV-4 mediated HCC may point to potential for benefit of therapeutic interventions aimed at control of IR, and IR-associated signals, in these patients.", "", "In this process, endothelial selectin (E-selectin), which is upregulated by IR both on the level of the mRNA and protein A key response of both normal and tumor cells to IR is the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) Here we addressed the questions of whether (i) IR can enhance the binding of tumor cells to the endothelium thus assisting metastasis and (ii) statins are able to mitigate IR-stimulated metastatic processes. We show that IR stimulates tumor cell-endothelial cell adhesion Previously, we reported a pro-adhesive IR response of human endothelial cells (EC), which is due to the upregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules, in particular E-selectin, via NF-\u03baB A: Human colon carcinoma cells (HT29) were irradiated with 2\u201310 Gy.

Modulation of the DDR has shown to affect tumor cell survival to IR. It is anticipated that novel radiosensitizers that enhance IR-mediated tumor cell killing will be incorporated into the standard treatment regimen for glioblastoma. Such radiosensitizers will target the DDR induced by IR. Elucidating how an individual patient\u2019s tumor responds to IR-mediated DSBs will result in individualized targeting of the DDR pathway to achieve radiosensitization and improvement in patient outcomes in glioblastoma. Radiosensitizers are agents that when delivered with IR improve the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy by selectively increasing tumor cell kill while sparing normal tissue.", "The protective mechanisms act by modulating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reducing DNA damage and by other, yet undetermined, processes ( The purpose of these studies was to determine if the addition of antioxidants and metabolic energy substrates would enhance the efficacy of membrane sealing poloxamers in the preservation of cell viability following massive doses of IR. Ethidium homodimer-1 (EH), dissolved in 1:4 DMSO: water, and calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Oregon), dissolved in dry DMSO, were added from stock solutions to stain the cells at final concentrations of 10 and 3.3 Cells were exposed to When transported to the IR chamber, the cells were placed on top of a 37\u00b0C heating pad, and then inside of an insulated box in order to minimize temperature variation between the samples. At 20 minutes post-irradiation or sham exposure, culture dishes were then divided into treatment groups: (1) non-IR sham-exposed controls; (2) IR-exposed untreated controls; (3) IR-exposed and treated with 1mM P188; (4) IR-exposed and treated with 10mM NAC + 0.1mM Mg-ATP; (5) IR-exposed and treated with 10mM NAC + 0.1mM Mg-ATP + 1mM P188; (6) IR-exposed and treated with 1mM neutral dextran (18-hour only); (7) IR-exposed and treated with 2mM P188 (18-hour only) (8) IR-exposed and treated with 1mM PEG (48-hour only); (9) IR-exposed and treated with 10mM NAC (48-hour only); (10) IR-exposed and treated with 1mM P188 + 10mM NAC (48-hour only). Dishes containing the non-IR sham-exposed cells and IR-exposed, non-treated control cells received additional media culture equivalent to the volume added to the treated dishes. IR-exposed or sham-exposed cells were returned to culture and untouched for 18 or 48 hours at 37\u00b0C in Minimum Essential Medium, supplemented with 10% Nu-serum, inside a 37\u00b0C, 5% CO The results of the fluorescence observations from each sample were tabulated as the number of cells with red EH fluorescence, regardless of concomitant green calcein fluorescence (non-viable), and the number with exclusively green calcein fluorescence (viable). Our analysis considered the mean percentage viability for the multiple samples conducted at each testing parameter (non-IR sham-exposed, IR-exposed untreated controls, IR-exposed treated with variable permutations of P188, NAC, Mg-ATP, dextran, PEG) at the testing interval (18, 48hrs). A repeated measure ANOVA analysis was used to test for an effect due to post-IR cofactor treatment with and without P188. At this point, the viable muscle cells were considered recovered from the harvest and entered into the IR exposure or sham exposure experiments. The viability of the non-IR treated skeletal muscle cells remained stable near 80 \u00b1 6.1% throughout the duration of the experiments. None of the polymers or other therapeutic agents used in these experiments caused a significant change in the viability of non-IR exposed skeletal muscle cultures. The effect of various protocols on the survival of skeletal muscle cells 18 hours after 40 Gy IR is illustrated in The mean percent survival of cells treated with combined NAC and MgATP is significantly greater than that of the cells that received no treatment (48.2 \u00b1 6% versus 6.9 \u00b1 3%) however is less than that of the sham-exposed cells (78.0 \u00b1 2.3%). Following exposure to massive concentrations of IR-generated reactive oxygen species, cell viability is enhanced by sealing of the cellular membrane, scavenging of free radicals and the augmentation of cellular energy metabolism. It was previously reported that under the same IR-exposure and culture conditions, the majority of skeletal muscle cell cultures treated only with fresh media were completely disrupted within four hours of IR exposure. Sealing IR-lysed membranes with sub-critical micelle concentrations of copolymer surfactant P188 in culture media prevented acute necrosis and prolonged survival. This finding suggests that multiple cell death pathways are initiated by exposure to massive IR. Radioprotective agents used after exposure to massive doses of IR may be broadly classified into three groups: free radical scavengers, modulators of receptor-coupled pathways, and molecules that stabilize the plasma membrane. Amifostine, an antioxidant studied by the US military for soldiers at risk of massive radiation exposure, was shown to provide superior radioprotective properties ( The capability to prolong viability for one to two days following massive IR generation of free radicals has value. IR may trigger cell death processes through multiple pathways. Sealing the cell membrane is one of the critical steps required for cellular viability following exposure to massive doses of IR. 48hr mean percent survival (\u00b1SEM) of non-IR exposed cells, as well as survival of IR-exposed cells receiving P188 alone, PEG alone, cofactor NAC alone as well as combined with P188 or MgATP and P188 with NAC and MgATP.", "The Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) was used to determine IR. HOMA values < 1 were considered normal and values > 2.5 indicated a high probability of IR. Insulin sensitivity was determined by Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR). Central obesity hyperinsulinemia is associated with clinical conditions such as IR, diabetic dyslipidemia, hypertension, albuminuria, and proinflammatory-prothrombotic proinflammatory and prothrombotic. CRP was found to be independently associated with body weight, IR, and SBP. White blood cell count and fibrinogen were associated with obesity and IR. IR can cause elevated levels of CRP release and this effect is similar to the effect of insulin on the hepatic acute phase protein synthesis. [ The strong association between CRP levels and IR determined by the HOMA-IR formulation was revealed in a study evaluating the relationship between CRP level as an inflammatory marker and other CVD risk factors, which comprised of 1025 subjects aged between 35 and 60 years, without any known health condition. Although, due to insufficient comparable worldwide data, this study may conclude the importance of MetS and IR in IBD patients.", "Studies have shown that increased systemic retinol binding protein (RBP) levels are associated with IR and hyperinflammation in diabetic and obese patients. The aim of this study was to determine RBP profiles and to test the hypothesis that elevated RBP levels are associated with both IR and the inflammatory response in burned patients. Statistical analysis was performed by Student Fifty-one patients (high group) had elevated RBP levels during acute hospitalization and demonstrated a significant higher incidence of multiorgan failure, sepsis, and mortality ( Increased RBP levels postburn correlate with increased IR, inflammatory and catabolic responses, incidence of multiorgan failure, and mortality. The relevance of our study is that we were able to show that RBP plays a more important role than previously thought and may predict IR and hyperglycemia in trauma or severely injured patients. A study conducted by Graham et al However, to date, no large studies have examined the involvement of RBP in a stress-induced IR scenario. The various underlying cellular mechanisms and the involved pathways of trauma-induced IR are currently the subject of several investigations. High plasma triglyceride levels can be either attributed to the effects of IR leading to a decreased uptake of triglycerides in peripheral tissue or, in this context, to an increased lipolysis caused by macrophage activity. The results of our study suggest that serum RBP levels correlate with stress-induced IR as well as hypermetabolic and inflammatory responses. On the basis of our results, we propose that systemic RBP levels may serve as a clinical marker for stress-induced IR and inflammatory processes during the acute phase postburn.", "New signaling pathways of the interleukin (IL) family, interferons (IFN) and interferon regulatory factors (IRF) have recently been found within tumor microenvironments and in metastatic sites. IRFs, a family of nine mammalian transcription factors, have multiple biologic functions that when dysregulated may contribute to tumorigenesis; most well-known are their roles in regulating/initiating host immunity. Some IRF family members have been implicated in tumorigenesis yet little is still known of their expression in primary human tumors or their role(s) in disease development/progression. IRF5 is one of the newer family members to be studied and has been shown to be a critical mediator of host immunity and the cellular response to DNA damage. Here, we examined the expression of IRF5 in primary breast tissue and determined how loss of expression may contribute to breast cancer development and/or progression. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival breast tissue specimens from patients with atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), ductal carcinoma Analysis of IRF expression in human breast tissues revealed the unique down-regulation of IRF5 in patients with different grades of DCIS and IDC as compared to IRF1; loss of IRF5 preceded that of IRF1 and correlated with increased invasiveness. Overexpression of IRF5 in breast cancer cells inhibited IRF5 is an important tumor suppressor that regulates multiple cellular processes involved in the conversion of normal mammary epithelial cells to tumor epithelial cells with metastatic potential. Breast cancer is a heterogenous disease whose progression from atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) to ductal carcinoma IRF5 is a transcription factor that regulates type I IFN signaling [ Little is known of IRF5 tumor suppressor function. IRF5 was cloned into the pBabe-puromycin vector at BamHI/SalI sites transfected to Phoenix cells as described [ H&E sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archival tissue specimens were reviewed by two pathologists (MH and NM) for histological evaluation of disease and grade. Slides from 19 patients with ADH, 24 with DCIS, 29 with IDC, and 11 with lymph node metastases were evaluated for IRF expression. The study was approved by the NJMS Institutional Review Board (IRB) and all participants provided written informed consent. Antigen retrieval was performed by heating slides at 95\u00b0C in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for one hour before staining with mouse anti-IRF5 or rabbit anti-IRF1 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) antibodies at 1:100 dilution in 4% BSA overnight. For IHC, slides were incubated with 1:200 diluted anti-IRF5 for two hours then 1:1,000 diluted Alkaline Phosphatase anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories, AP-2000) and developed with the Vector Evaluation of stained slides was assessed by one pathologist (MH) and two independent reviewers (XB and BJB or JA), who were unaware of the patient's characteristics. This classification allowed the stratification of the tumors as positive or negative for IRF1 and IRF5. Comparisons between values were analyzed by the Student's IRF1 and IRF5 expression were examined in FFPE specimens from patients with different stages of breast cancer by IF and IHC. Normal ducts gave diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear staining for IRF1, as shown by the purple color in the merged IF panel, as well as IHC, that was consistent with previous findings [ Of the 19 patients with ADH, 100% showed positive staining for IRF1 and IRF5 (Figures Review of pathology data, including grade as scored by the original clinical pathologist, estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and Her2 receptor status, was performed by Dr. Hameed, a licensed pathologist, under an approved NJMS IRB. Given the small sample size, it was difficult to make statistical correlations between receptor and IRF expression; however, data at present suggest that loss of IRF5 expression correlates with ER/PR(-) breast cancers in 82 to 90% of samples. Loss of Her2/neu expression did not correlate with IRF5 expression. Evaluation of IRF1 expression in relation to tumor characteristics gave no correlations [ We next examined IRF1 and IRF5 protein expression in immortalized tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells and non-oncogenic mammary epithelial cell lines to confirm findings in primary tissues. IRF1 and IRF5 levels were consistently reduced in breast cancer cell lines compared to non-oncogenic mammary epithelial MCF-12A cells (Figure To determine whether the observed growth inhibition was due to IRF5-mediated apoptosis or necrosis, we measured AnnV-FITC and PI-double staining by flow cytometry. Overexpression in untreated MDA-MB-231 cells (MDA-MB-231/pBIRF5) induced apoptosis approximately 2.5-fold over empty vector control cells (Figure The fact that IRF5 is well expressed in immortalized non-oncogenic mammary epithelial cells compared to breast cancer cells and tumor tissues is consistent with the concept that IRF5 is a tumor suppressor protein. Overexpression studies confirm a role for IRF5 in cell growth and response to DNA damage (Figures To determine directly whether IRF5 could act as a tumor suppressor Intracardiac or intravenous injection of MDA-MB-231 cells generates a rapid experimental model of tumor metastasis. Nonetheless, mice injected with MDA-MB-231/pBIRF5 cells that generated primary tumors showed no metastases. This, combined with Genes differentially regulated by IRF5 in MDA-MB-231 cells. To ensure that there is a correlation between Since these data suggested that IRF5 may contribute to the regulation of CXCR4 in breast cancer cells, we performed a computer-based analysis of the human Further support for IRF5 in regulating tumor metastasis was obtained by examining IRF5 expression in clinical metastatic lymph node tissues from IDC patients. As expected, all samples examined were negative for IRF5 expression, except one that showed very low levels (Additional file Results presented here provide the first clear support of IRF5 tumor suppressor function and identify a new role for IRF5 in tumor cell invasion/metastasis. We demonstrated that loss of IRF5 expression correlated with advanced stages of breast cancer and invasion/metastasis. Loss of IRF5 preceded that of IRF1, but loss of IRF5 expression was not a prerequisite for IRF1 and IRF5 overexpression did not affect IRF1 levels (Figure Although we found that IRF1 and IRF5 were similarly expressed in normal breast tissue and patients with ADH or IDC, significant differences were observed in DCIS suggesting the unique utilization of these two biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. Another important distinction between these two transcription factors was in cellular expression; IRF5 was predominantly expressed in MECs (Figure Clinical data from tissue specimens combined with expression analyses and 3-D cultures provide the first clues that IRF5 may be involved in regulating tumor metastases, where loss of IRF5 enhances metastatic potential. A cursory review of the literature indicates that this function is unique to IRF5 and not IRF1. The molecular mechanism by which IRF5 inhibits invasion/metastasis is not yet clear but likely involves the dysregulation of genes, such as Further studies will be necessary to address the question of how or why IRF5 expression is altered in different stages of human breast cancer. Results from Q-PCR analysis of Altogether, data presented here support a differential role for IRF1 and IRF5 in breast tumorigenesis warranting further investigation regarding prognostic and therapeutic implications.

These investigations examine the response to IR at the exon level in human cells, using exon arrays to comprehensively characterize radiation-induced transcriptional expression products. Previously uncharacterized alternative transcripts that preferentially occur following IR exposure have been discovered. A large number of genes showed alternative transcription initiation as a response to IR. Furthermore, identifying the IR transcriptional response profile also benefits establishment of biological dosage predictors, understanding response to other radiological exposures and can contribute to the development of new radio-pharmaceuticals. Two major pathways involved in DNA DSB repair are non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination both involving many proteins The IR response at the transcriptional level has been characterized to some degree in different experimental settings for the human genome Post-transcriptional processing is a primary mechanism to generate protein diversity. These include alternative use of exons, different 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 splice sites, alternative transcription start sites, alternative termination sites, as well as intron retention and mutually exclusive alternative exons Alternative transcription is important in the regulation of genes involved in many cell processes and genetic diseases including cancer Inhibition of RNA polymerase II elongation has been shown to be a mechanism for genotoxic stress (ultraviolet radiation) induction of AS proposed to be due to allowance of weaker splicing sites to participate in AS Some specific genes have been found to use a secondary promoter following IR to produce a radiation-induced isoform. These genes include Human exon arrays were used to identify transcription changes, including the induction of AS, in cells exposed to IR. This allows the determination of relative levels of each exon for a given treatment, facilitating identification of exons that are differentially expressed after IR. Given present estimates that most genes can use AS Here we analyse the human transcriptome IR response for both dose and time in two human cell types, lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and primary fibroblasts at the level of individual exons. Alternative transcription and other genome-wide transcription features have been identified as a response to IR. The extensive transcript coverage and relatively large number of samples allowed us to obtain robust whole gene expression levels inclusive of exon specific expression for LCLs and primary fibroblasts in response to 10 Gy at 4 hours post-IR. Similar conditions have been used in previous IR response papers *Genes that are also found in the top fibroblast cells gene list ( Exact p-values and adjusted p-values are provided in supplemental materials. The differences in PSR transcripts four hours after exposure to IR for all genes were determined using an AS ANOVA (Partek Genomics Suite) and FIRMA and calculated splicing indexes for each exon. These genes have been called significant in all the three alternative-splicing analysis methods: Partek, FIRMA and Affymetrix's Splicing Index. Exact p-values and adjusted p-values can be found in supplemental materials; only Partek's and FIRMA's p-values are reported. These genes have been called significant in all the three alternative-splicing analysis methods: Partek, FIRMA and Affymetrix's Splicing Index. Exact p-values and adjusted p-values can be found in supplemental materials; only Partek's and FIRMA's p-values are reported. The relative expression of each core PSR for a selection of individual genes with a variety of profiles in LCLs ( Up- (A, C, E\u2013H) and down-regulated (B, D) gene probe selection regions (PSRs) 4 hours following 10 Gy IR in LCLs, which identifies transcript expression at the exon level. Exon expression examples are shown for the following genes: Up- (A, C\u2013E) and down-regulated (B, F\u2013H) gene probe selection regions (PSRs) 4 hours following 10 Gy IR in fibroblasts, which identifies transcript expression at the exon level. A large proportion of genes modulated in the LCLs 4 h after 10 Gy IR were also modulated in the fibroblast cells. PSR expression levels for Additional methods for identifying alternative spliced products included FIRMA and SI tests ( There is a high degree of overlap for radiation modulated whole gene expression between LCLs and fibroblasts. Gene expression (as determined from exon microarrays) across the Investigation of dose response was completed using a range from 1 Gy to 20 Gy of IR. RNA was collected at 4 hours post-IR, processed and run on exon arrays for four cell lines for each cell type. Examples of genes that showed modulation with dose are plotted ( Transcripts for Examples of gene expression as a function of log2-intensity of fluorescence is plotted for The effect that time had on the transcript levels was also investigated using time points spanning from 2 to 48 hours post-IR (10 Gy) in four cell lines for both LCL and fibroblast samples. Selected genes, that show a modulation with time, are plotted ( The location of IR-modulated genes for each chromosome was determined to identify regions that may have IR-specific regulation. In general, responsive genes four hours post-IR were present throughout the chromosomes and more so in gene-rich regions. For example, chromosomes 6 and 11 have regions that show enriched gene expression modulation after IR ( 12 LCLs were irradiated with 10 Gy or sham IR and RNA was isolated 4 hours post-IR. Genes with significant (p-value (Dose)<0.05) up-regulated (blue circles) and down-regulated (red circles) 4 hours after 10 Gy IR are plotted above the chromosome location. 12 fibroblast cells were irradiated with 10 Gy or sham IR and RNA was isolated 4 hours post-IR. Genes with significant (p-value (Dose)<0.05) up-regulated (blue circles)and down-regulated (red circles) 4 hours after 10 Gy IR are plotted above the chromosome location. Four hours after 10 Gy IR, down-regulated genes in LCLs were selected based first on p-value of <0.1 and then the top 500 genes based on fold change were selected and plotted (B). Four hours after 10 Gy IR, up-regulated genes were selected based first on p-value of <0.1 and then the top 500 genes based on fold change were selected and plotted (E). Gene functional ontologies for the IR regulated genes were determined and cell cycle, cellular assembly and organization, DNA replication, recombination and repair, cell death and cellular movement were the top 5 functional categories in LCLs as determined by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ( Genes such as Gene transcription at the exon level in response to IR has been determined enabling identification of alternative transcription products across the whole genome in response to IR. These results are consistent with previously reported alternative transcript gene products in response to IR for single gene examples We have identified a large number of genes that show transcript expression modulation characteristic of alternative transcripts in response to IR. Some genes that show AS following IR have important functional roles in cell fate decisions in response to IR-induced cell and DNA damage. Our array data indicate that genes such as Some genes show patterns consistent with induction of alternative start sites such as We observed that many transcripts are down-regulated in response to IR. This is evident in many genes involved in the cell cycle and undoubtedly reflects, at least in part, the well known cell cycle delays induced by IR. A feature identified in this investigation by probing at the exon level is that for some regions of transcripts that are, in general, down-regulated, often show just one or part of an exon, without an expression decrease after IR exposure. This was commonly observed in the first exon or two as is evident for LCLs and fibroblasts respond differently to the same radiation treatment, and therefore, have a cell type specific response to IR. For example, a number of genes (e.g., We also investigated the distribution of IR-modulated genes across the genome and found that some chromosomes had relatively high levels of IR responsive genes. We also found some chromosomal regions show enriched regions of IR-modulated genes. With this comprehensive data set we have been able to generate a transcription network of genes modulated by IR in two different cell types. Other alternative transcript mechansims, such as alternative splicing products in response to IR is an additional way to regulate appropriate cellular action. Furthermore, these novel aspects of the response to IR may be applicable to other DNA damaging agents and cell stressors in general.", "The measurement of evening body temperature (n=5\u20136 mice) indicated lower temperature in GHRKO mice in comparison to normal mice (P<0.0049) with a similar trend in the morning temperatures ( The two-way ANOVA test indicated a significant genotype/VFR interaction in IR total protein level (P<0.0140) ( The MRI analysis of tissues indicated no difference in fat accumulation in either liver or skeletal muscle when comparing sham-operated GHRKO and N mice ( Indirect calorimetry studies were conducted in the presence and in the absence of food. Our previous findings ( Additionally the analysis of genes involved in lipid metabolism indicated that relative expression of IR, PPAR\u03b3, PPAR\u03b1, PGC1\u03b1, SERBP and HSL was increased in epididymal fat from GHRKO as compared to normal mice without significant genotype effects in other fat depots. Decrease of the inhibitory IRS-1 phosphorylation at IRS1 Following the demonstration of different responses of glucose metabolism responses to VFR in normal and GHRKO mice, we investigated the impact of this intervention on metabolic rate and transitions of fuel selection between fat and carbohydrate oxidations by measuring VO In summary, surgical removal of visceral fat\u2014generally considered to be \u201cbad fat\u201d\u2014in normal animals broadly mimics the effects of CR in agreement with previous studies ( Collectively, the present findings suggest that GH signals in adipose tissue could be among key regulators of insulin action and longevity, and targeting suppression of this specific pathway in only white adipose tissue might produce beneficial CR-like effects in mammals. Aliquots of the medium were collected after being cultured for 24 hours and investigated for free glycerol content using commercial Kit (Sigma, St Louis, MO) The level of total IR and IRS1, and the phosphorylated forms (pY1158 IR and IRS1 Frozen tissue samples were thawed to 4\u00b0 C and analyzed using an EchoMRI 3-in-1 composition analyzer (Echo Medical Systems, Houston TX). A three-way ANOVA was used to analyze phosphorylation levels of IR and IRS1.", "Rats were divided into four groups: control, IR, allopurinol-treated IR (IR-Allo), and allopurinol-treated control (Allo). IR was induced by adding fructose and high fat, high salt diet for 12 weeks. IR was induced by adding fructose (10%) to everyday drinking water and feeding rats on high fat, high salt diet (16% crude protein, 28.2% crude fat, 2.8% crude fiber, 4.8% Ash, and 3.4% salt) for 12 weeks, while control animals receive tap water and standard diet (20% crude protein, 4% crude fat, 3.5% crude fiber, 6% Ash, and 0.5% salt). The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (IR index) was calculated using the serum nonfasting glucose and insulin levels according to the equation of Matthews et al. Body weight gain of the IR group was significantly increased ( Regarding UA it was increased in IR group, but this increase was nonsignificant. Treatment with Allo has decreased the level of UA significantly ( BP tracing showed normal BP values including systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, mean arterial pressure, and dicrotic notch pressure as well as normal heart rate in both control group and Allo group (Figures Regarding the cycle duration IR has no significant changes, including total cycle duration, ejection duration, diastolic duration, and time to peak. In addition, Allo has no effect in all cycle durations except for the ejection duration where it has significantly ( TNF- IR group showed significant increase in 4HNE ( In the present study, rats fed on fructose and high fat and high salt diet revealed IR evidenced by an increase in both insulin and glucose levels. IR is an important predisposing factor for several clinical disorders, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension [ Clinical and experimental studies have assessed the relationship between hyperuricemia and hypertension and found that hyperuricemia might play a double role as a risk factor for hypertension and as a pathological condition enhanced by hypertension itself [ Moreover, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in IR may reduce arterial wall compliance by promoting plaque growth, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, and nonenzymatic glycosylation of vessel wall proteins [ The results of the current study showed that Allo has alleviated the vascular complications of IR including systolic, diastolic, mean, and dicrotic notch pressures compared to the untreated IR group. [ Moreover, the current study showed an increased level of TNF- Allo treatment significantly alleviated this increased TNF- In addition, the results of the present study showed that treatment with Allo has ameliorated and decreased the increased level of 4HNE that was observed in IR group. 4HNE can also modulate signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, fibrosis, apoptosis, and inflammation, which are all hallmarks of cardiovascular diseases [ In conclusion, the results of the current study show that Allo has a protective effect on vascular complications of IR which may be attributed to the effect of Allo on decreasing the level of TNF- The authors would like to thank Mr. Islam Farouk, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for his effort and help in the experimental study. IR BP tracing (b) shows increase of both systolic and diastolic BP. IR + allopurinol (c) shows nearly normalized diastolic BP with significant decrease of the elevated systolic BP and increase in the diastolic time.", "On the other hand, extracellular receptor-activated kinase (Erk) is activated via the IR-SHC-RAF-MEK1-Erk signal transduction pathway (). PTP1B can dephosphorylate the IR as well as insulin receptor substrate (IRS) (). Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose Immunoprecipitation Reagent, anti-IR\u03b2, anti-IRS2 and anti-Tyr (P) (PY20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Insulin sensitivity was identified by the comprehensive analysis of the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and calculated homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and the insulin sensitivity index (ISI). HOMA-IR and ISI were calculated according to the following formula: (HOMA-IR index=FBG[mmol/L]\u00d7FINS[mIU/L]/22.5); ISI=1/[FBG(mmol/L)\u00d7FINS(mIU/L)], (). Protein extracts containing 200 \u03bcg of protein were immunoprecipitated 4 h at 4\u00b0C with gentle rotation in the presence of 5 \u03bcg of anti-IR\u03b2 or anti-IRS-2 antibody, followed by the addition of protein A/G agarose overnight at 4\u00b0C, After mixing, the pellets were collected by centrifugation, and the supernatants were discarded. Then the pellets were washed and saved for Western blotting analyses with anti-Tyr (P) (PY20) antibody to measure the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of IR\u03b2 and IRS-2. To test the effects of FU on tyrosine phosphorylation and total levels of IR\u03b2 and IRS-2, insulin-resistant HepG2 cells were exposed for 24 h to various concentrations of FU. As shown in , the treatment of insulin-resistant cells with FU (2.5, 10 and 20\u03bcM) for 24h increased the phosphorylation levels of IR\u03b2 (A) and IRS-2(B). These results demonstrated that FU or PI improved glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in KKAy mice, which was confirmed by decrease of HOMA-IR (E) and increase of ISI (F). As shown in , phosphorylation level of IR\u03b2(C), IRS-2(D) and Akt (A) in liver tissues of KKAy mice were decreased, compared with the normal group mice. Oral glucose tolerance test, HOMA-IR index, and increased ISI are simple and widely accepted methods for indirect assessment of peripheral insulin action and insulin resistance in animals. Our present results have demonstrated that treatment with FU reduced FBG levels, the AUC of OGTT, HOMA-IR index, and increased ISI, and therefore ameliorated glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in diabetic KKAy mice. The biological effect of insulin is initiated with insulin binding to the \u03b1-subunit of IR and activating the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the \u03b2-subunit of the receptor. The activation of IR leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS (), the phosphorylated IRS activates PI3K (), and subsequently, the activated PI3K phosphorylates Ser/Thr kinase Akt. Some studies have shown that PTP1B overexpression inhibits phosphorylation of IR and IRS leading to insulin resistance (). Recent studies have reported that PTP1B inhibitor increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of IR, and activated the downstream molecules of insulin signaling such as IRS-1, Akt, and Erk1/2 (). In the present study, the effects of FU on the PTP1B expression, the phosphorylated and total of IR\u03b2, IRS-2, Akt in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells and liver tissues of KKAy mice were evaluated. As a result, FU decreased the expression of PTP1B, and increased the phosphorylation of IR\u03b2, IRS-2 and Akt both in diabetic KKAy mice and in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. Overall, these data revealed that FU decreased PTP1B expression leading to the increased phosphorylation of IR\u03b2, IRS-2, Akt, GSK3\u03b2 and Erk1/2 in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, at the same time leading to the increased phosphorylation of IR\u03b2, IRS-2 and Akt in diabetic KKAy mice.", "No significant heterogeneity was observed among the analyzed studies investigating the The effect of the As already mentioned, increased ENPP1 levels blockade the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor \u03b1-subunit in many cells, causing IR [ Thus, taking into account the role of ENPP1 in IR, several studies have investigated the association between the Regarding the association between the K121Q polymorphism and DKD or related features, De Cosmo It is worth noting that several genome wide association studies have searched for chromosomal regions linked or associated with renal function phenotypes in T2DM patients, such as DKD, eGFR or creatinine/albumin ration [ The specific mechanisms that explain the association between the Q allele and risk for DKD are not known [ Meta-analysis has been regarded as a powerful tool for pooling data from several studies, which could overcome the problem of small sample numbers as well as insufficient statistical power of genetic association studies of complex diseases [ In conclusion, our results indicate that the (DOC) Click here for additional data file.", "Several small molecule IR activators have been identified and reported to exhibit insulin sensitization properties. One of these molecules, TLK19781 (Cmpd1), was investigated to examine its IR sensitizing action All relevant data are within the paper. Collectively, they represent some of the most potent glucose lowering agents and a large portion of worldwide anti-hyperglycemic agent prescriptions [ Insulin mimetics, including novel peptides bearing no sequence homology with insulin [ In a search for IR activators, a set of small molecules was identified by affinity screening using the IR intracellular domain [ All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Merck Research Laboratories, NJ, USA. Male db/db mice were purchased at 5 weeks of age from Jackson laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and housed eight per cage in temperature, humidity, and light controlled rooms with A mouse model of reversible insulin receptor knockdown with expression of an IR-specific shRNA was obtained from Taconic Farm (Germantown, NY, USA). Healthy normoglycemic C57BL/6 mice and age-matched STZ-diabetic mice were studied under the same conditions to compare insulin signaling using phospho-IR (pIR) and phospho-Akt (pAkt). Phospho-IR was measured using an ELISA kit (Tyr 1150/1151; Cell Signaling Technologies, MA, USA) and a phospho-Akt (Ser 473; Meso Scale Discovery, MD, USA) assay kit according to manufacturer's instructions. Lack of hypoglycemia from the combination treatment can be better viewed in scattered plots ( To elucidate the mechanism of glucose lowering potency increase without additive hypoglycemia risk mediated by the combination of Cmpd1 and insulin, tissue specific IR and Akt phosphorylation levels were compared in normoglycemic and STZ-diabetic mice. In order to compare the effects across all conditions, fold changes of pIR and pAkt over basal condition were calculated. In normoglycemic C57BL/6 mice, insulin and its combination with Cmpd1 showed a larger increase in both pIR and pAkt in liver vs. skeletal muscle ( Mice were fasted for 4 hours and received Cmpd1 i.p. Tissue lysate phospho-protein analysis was conducted using phosphor-IR (Y1150/1151) from Cell Signaling Technology and phospho-Akt (Ser473) Assay kit from Meso Scale Technology. Fold changes of compound treated vs. basal untreated samples were calculated for pIR normoglycemic mice (A), pIR diabetic mice (B), pAkt normoglycemic mice (C) and pAkt diabetic mice (D). Basal liver pIR and pAkt levels in STZ-diabetic mice were ~3 fold higher than that in normoglycemic mice but overall magnitude of stimulation by insulin or Cmpd1 insulin combination are comparable in the two models. Basal muscle pIR and pAkt levels are similar in the two models. When insulin signaling is compared between normoglycemic and diabetic mice, it is clear that Cmpd1 enhances pIR in both lean and STZ mice ( Cmpd1 was identified from an affinity screen and has been shown to interact with IR Mice expressing IR-specific shRNA were fed with doxycycline in drinking water from day 1\u201311. (C) Hyperglycemic IR-shRNA mice 15 days post doxycycline treatment received acute treatment of Cmpd1 (30 mg/kg) and insulin (1 U/kg) individually or in combination. As shown in Another possible explanation for the apparent glucose sensing action of Cmpd1 could be related to its effects on IR downstream signaling, which arise from its binding to an IR intracellular region close to the kinase domain and multiple Tyr phosphorylation sites [ In summary, the The authors are thankful to Tina Fleming for Cmpd1 level measurements.", "To gain more insight into the long-term dose response relationship at low-dose exposures, we analyzed 8 relevant markers (CD31, E-selectin, thrombomodulin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, collagen IV, Thy-1, CD45) by quantitative immunofluorescence and 11 systemic plasma markers (IL6, KC, MCP-1, TNF, TGF, INF, IL-10, sICAM-1, sE-selectin, sVCAM-1 and fibrinogen) by commercial ELISA or cytometric bead array 3 and 5 months after TBI of Apoprotein E The pathogenetic mechanisms of radiation-induced vascular effects involve the acute induction of reactive oxygen intermediates [ CD45, a pan leukocyte marker, has been used here to evaluate the presence of leukocytes in heart tissue with and without IR. IR-induced disturbances in the (anti-)coagulant system may lead to endothelial damage and chronic organ dysfunction. Analysis for endothelial proteins (CD31, E-selectin, thrombomodulin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and Thy-1) revealed a significant age-dependent increase at 5 and 8 months compared with animals at 2 month of age ( The expression of High radiation doses are known to induce cardiac microvascular damage and are often associated with inflammatory and fibrotic changes [ In this study we examined late effects of low-dose irradiation with specific emphasis on heart microvascular damage, using an atherosclerosis-prone ApoE The significant increase of The dose-dependent changes in cell counts of the endothelial cell markers For thrombomodulin, increased immunoreactivity and release as an acute response, followed by a downregulation at later time points, has been reported after high dose IR. In HUVECs IR-induced damage was associated with an acute release of thrombomodulin at 24 h after irradiation at 12.5 Gy, followed by a reduced capacity of the cells to produce and release thrombomodulin 6 days after exposure [ In this study, no significant changes of Cardiac fibrosis is one of the late sequelae of high-dose IR. Thereby, fibrosis is often preceded by inflammation and capillary injury, followed by an increased synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) including collagens [ Data about collagen IV alterations after IR are rare. We could demonstrate for the first time significantly enhanced collagen IV deposits 3 months after IR with very low dose levels (0.025 Gy), which returned to control levels at 6 months. This time course follows reports about early increased collagen deposits at 20 but not at 40 weeks after high dose IR (16 Gy) in mice [ The radiation-induced local anti-inflammatory effects described above, were paralleled by an increase of plasma markers, like fibrinogen, TNF\u03b1 and MCP-1, indicating a long term systemic prothrombotic and proinflammatory response, already at very low doses (from 0.025 Gy onwards).", "However, a rigorous test of the reliability of the mechanisms found in the simulations requires calculation of the time-dependent experimental observable, i.e., in the present case the IR signal in the amide I region. Here, we combine molecular dynamics simulation with a mixed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics theoretical methodology, the Perturbed Matrix Method, in order to characterize the folding of a \u03b2-hairpin peptide, through modeling the time-dependence of the amide I IR signal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the simulation of the time-resolved IR signal of a complex process occurring on a long (microsecond) time scale.", "Liver-specific insulin receptor knockout mice exhibit intense IR, severe glucose intolerance and striking hyperinsulinemia [ Circadian rhythmicity exists in mammals and is essential in the response to numerous physiological requests [ The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) and \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) are nuclear receptors expressed predominantly in the liver during both the fed and fasted state. Circadian rhythmicity was determined by cross-sectional analysis using the Cosinor procedure that assumed a 24 h period as described previously [ To study the progress of IR and DM in neonatally STZ-treated male mice, the BW, blood glucose, insulin levels, and glucose and insulin tolerance were examined. The PND2-STZ group developed IR status between 20- to 40-weeks old and DM status between 44- to 48-weeks old. From two- to 43-weeks old, the BW was similar between the control group and the PND2-STZ group ( After overnight fasting, the blood glucose levels at all time points for both groups post 50% dextrose administration were similar at 16-weeks old ( To verify the specific effects of rosiglitazone (Rosi) on glucose and insulin tolerance, the PPAR\u03b3 antagonist (GW9662) and PPAR\u03b1 antagonist (GW6471) were used during IR at 32-weeks old and DM at 48-weeks old. Rosi improved the IR status but had a minor effect on the DM status. The IR and control groups both received the same treatments. The control groups with treatments showed no significant differences in the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests ( Values are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM (5~6 animals for each time point in A, C, E and G panels; 35 animals for the control group and 35~36 animals for the IR or DM groups with further treatments in B, D, F and H panels). * This is also illustrated by the AUC measurement ( The 48-week old male mice in the IR group developed DM status and exhibited: 1) decreased BW, 2) higher fasting glucose levels, 3) lower serum insulin levels, 4) glucose intolerance and 5) glycosuria ( To study the effects of Rosi, IR and DM statuses on the hepatic circadian-clock systems, hepatic gene expression was detected in the IR status at 32-weeks old and the DM status at 48-weeks old. Rosi was able to influence the hepatic circadian-clock and related gene expressions on both the IR and DM statuses. Most of the measured circadian-clock and energy metabolism-related gene expression in the liver exhibited circadian patterns at 32-weeks old in the IR status and at 48-week old in the DM status (Figs. * The exception was The DM status at 48-weeks old showed similar elevations of gene expression as those in the IR group at 32-weeks old. To further verify whether the changes in protein levels were similar to the changes in gene expression, the BMAL1 and PPAR\u03b3 protein levels in the livers were detected ( Values represent the mean \u00b1 SEM (3 animals for each group including the control (open bar), IR (striped) and IR + Rosi (filled)). * BMAL1 and PPAR\u03b3 protein levels exhibited the circadian patterns at 32-weeks old in the control, IR and IR with two-week treatment of Rosi conditions ( Due to the beneficial effects of two week (short-term) Rosi treatments, a long-term study was implemented. The long-term and early treatment of Rosi showed the better improvement in BW, blood glucose, insulin levels, and glucose and insulin tolerance tests as well as the hepatic circadian-clock and related gene expression on the IR and DM statuses. PPAR\u03b3 activation is a therapeutic application that controls hyperglycemia and attenuates IR in type 2 DM. Rosi was administered in the drinking water from 20- to 60-weeks old and this chronic Rosi treatment was able to attenuate or delay the IR response in the intraperitoneal glucose and insulin tolerance tests as well as changes in the circadian-clock system. This confirms that PPAR\u03b3 agonists are beneficial for IR and also for the circadian-clock system [ Previous studies found that the hepatic circadian-clock system was impaired or dysfunctional in type 1 DM conditions [ The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei enable control of peripheral oscillators through neuronal and humoral signals. The chronic and low dose administration of the PPAR\u03b3 agonist is sufficient to attenuate and preserve the markedly reduced IR and/or DM-related changes in the hepatic circadian-clock system and maintain glucose homeostasis. Employing the insulin sensitizing PPAR\u03b3 agonist Rosi effectively improved the physiological parameters in the IR and DM conditions.", "However, four out of seven MM cell lines analyzed exhibited a subset of persistent DSBs, marked by \u03b3-H2AX and Rad51 foci that elicited a prolonged G2/M DNA damage checkpoint activation and hypersensitivity to IR, especially in the presence of checkpoint inhibitors. Our results showed that several MM cell lines accumulate a subset of persistent DSBs after irradiation that makes them hypersensitive to IR and dependent on a functional G2/M checkpoint for survival. Cells were treated with the apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (CliniSciences, Barcelona, Spain) at 30 \u03bcM, and then irradiated with 40 Gy of IR. The end joining reporter plasmid pEGFP-Pem1-Ad2 was used to determine the in vivo levels of NHEJ [ U266, JJN3, LINF692 and LINF903 were transfected with 1 \u03bcg of the NHEJ-C reporter construct linearized by digestion with The HR reporter plasmid was used to determine the in vivo levels of HR [ Differences between the data were assessed for statistical significance using the Student's unpaired two tailed To analyze DSB formation and repair we first monitored the phosphorylation of H2AX (\u03b3H2AX), a sensitive marker of DSBs [ (A) Asynchronous cells were treated with 2 Gy IR, fixed at the indicated times post-irradiation, and stained with anti- \u03b3H2AX and secondary fluorescent antibodies. Kinetics of \u03b3H2AX disappearance is illustrated for each cell line by a histogram, showing the levels of \u03b3H2AX at different times post-IR, and a graphic, where the mean intensity of \u03b3H2AX (in arbitrary units) is plotted. (B) Residual \u03b3H2AX, quantified as the ratio of the signal at 24h post-IR/signal in non-irradiated cells, was obtained as the mean of three independent experiments. Error bars correspond to standard deviation (SD) (** p<0.01, * p<0.05, compared to LINF cells, Student's To corroborate the results obtained by flow cytometry, we analyzed \u03b3H2AX foci at different times post-IR (2 Gy). In the absence of treatment, all MM cell lines, with the exception of IM9 and U266, exhibited more \u03b3H2AX foci than controls ( (A) Representative images of \u03b3H2AX foci in untreated cells, and in cells irradiated with 2 Gy 1h, 7h and 24h post-IR. Rad51 foci in cells at 24h post-IR are also shown. (B) Percentage of cells with \u03b3H2AX foci at the indicated times post-IR. (C) and (D) Quantification of the number of \u03b3H2AX foci per cell at 7 and 24h post-IR. (A) Cells were irradiated with 40 Gy of IR and mean tail moment calculated at different time points using the OpenComet software. Cells were fixed at the indicated times post-IR and DNA content was measured by flow cytometry. Percentages of cells in the different phases of the cell cycle are indicated and duplication times (DT) were calculated ( As it has been described that cells retaining \u03b3H2AX foci at 24 h post-IR are more sensitive to IR [ We then reasoned that since the G2/M checkpoint response was stronger in some MM cell lines, these cells could exhibit a greater dependence on a functional checkpoint for survival to IR. We found that NHEJ efficiency was significantly higher in MM compared to control LINF cell lines ( To molecularly characterize end joining repair, we used another To determine whether the increased activity of the Alt-NHEJ pathway in MM cells could be responsible for the higher frequency of NHEJ detected in the plasmid reactivation assays ( To analyze HR activity in MM we used the HR reported construct shown in (A) Reporter plasmid for detection of HR [ DSBs are the most deleterious form of DNA damage; if left unrepaired they can cause cell death, if misrepaired, they lead to genomic instability and, ultimately, to the development or progression of cancer [ Our initial experiments, measuring the repair kinetics of IR-induced DSBs by H2AX phosphorylation, suggested a defect in DSB repair in 4 out of 7 MM cell lines analyzed (Figs. Additional evidence for the presence of higher numbers of persistent DSBs in some MM cell lines came from the analysis of the cell cycle after treatment with IR. It has been described that duration of IR-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest depends on the level of damage and repair capacity. Thus, cells exposed to low levels of IR (below 2 Gy) usually do not show G2 arrest at 24h post-IR, whereas cells exposed to higher dose (10 Gy) show a clear cell cycle arrest [ Previous reports have shown that cell lines that retain higher numbers of \u03b3-H2AX or Rad51 foci 24h post-IR are more sensitive to IR [ The Deregulation of the HR pathway also contributes to genome instability [ Here, we describe for the first time, that MM cells also show elevated levels of proteins involved in Alt-NHEJ and an increased activity of this pathway, revealed by larger DNA deletions and higher microhomology use at repair junctions than control cells, that were reduced by chemical inhibition of the pathway.", "Therefore, we sought to test if acute overexpression of SIRT1 in skeletal muscle of high-fat diet (HFD) rats in vivo would affect subsarcolemmal (SS) and intermyofibrillar (IMF) mitochondrial complexes I-V activities and antioxidant enzymes thereby improving insulin action. In vivo electrotransfer was used to overexpress SIRT1 in the skeletal muscle of rats fed HFD for 12 weeks. Skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and downstream effects of SIRT1 on AMPK, SIRT3, and mitochondrial biogenesis were studied. HFD rats showed skeletal muscle IR as well as decreased SIRT1 and SIRT3 expressions, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and mitochondrial biogenesis (p < 0.05). By contrast, moderate (~2.5 folds) SIRT1 overexpression attenuated HFD-induced skeletal muscle IR. This improvement was associated with increased AMPK, PGC-1\u03b1, SIRT3, and mtDNA expressions as well as SS and IMF mitochondrial CS and complexes I-V activities. Importantly, SIRT1 overexpression largely restored antioxidant enzyme activities and enhanced complex I but not complexes II-V functions in individual SS and IMF mitochondria. This study suggests that SIRT1 overexpression improved IR at least partly by targeting complex I functions of SS and IMF mitochondria through the activation of SIRT1 and SIRT3.", "The nicotine-dependent reduction in MKP1 induces the aberrant activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase leading to increased phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) at serine 307. This phosphorylation of IRS1 leads to its degradation, Akt inhibition, and the loss of insulin-mediated inhibition of lipolysis. Consequently, nicotine increases lipolysis, which results in body weight reduction, but this increase also elevates the levels of circulating free fatty acids and thus causes IR in insulin-sensitive tissues. These results newly place AMPK\u03b12 as an essential mediator of nicotine-induced whole-body IR in spite of reductions in adiposity. IR is often associated with obesity, inactivity, and excess body weight. Evidence indicates that AMPK inhibition causes IR, whereas AMPK activation increases insulin sensitivity To establish a causal relationship between nicotine, IR, and weight loss, nicotine (1.5 mg kg Further, we examined the glucose metabolic index (R Nicotine administration significantly resulted in lower body weight compared to vehicle-treated mice ( Next, we investigated if smaller adipocytes observed in nicotine-treated mice resulted from enhanced lipolysis. Under fasting conditions, serum concentrations of free fatty acids (FFAs) were similar between vehicle- and nicotine-treated mice ( It should be noted that, different from previous data using a high dose of nicotine Elevated levels of circulating FFAs are linked to IR We performed IPGTTs and found that acipimox partially reversed nicotine-induced glucose intolerance ( Next, we assayed the effects of nicotine on insulin signaling in WAT, skeletal muscle, and liver tissue. Acipimox abolished the nicotine-induced reduction (compared to vehicle treatment) of Irs1 protein in skeletal muscle and liver ( AMPK is a key energy and redox sensor In WAT, nicotine treatment was significantly associated with higher levels of phosphorylated AMPK (pAMPK) and acetyl-coA carboxylase (pACC) ( As shown above, because nicotine resulted in significantly less fat mass compared to vehicle, it was important to determine if selective AMPK\u03b12 deletion in WAT could prevent nicotine-induced IR and lipolysis. To this end, we found that nicotine resulted in greater MKP1 polyubiquitination when compared to vehicle-treated cells, but that expression of MKP1-S334A did not result in appreciable ubiquitination of MKP1 ( To further establish the role of MKP1 in nicotine-induced IR and lipolysis, adenoviruses encoding MKP1 or GFP were overexpressed in MEF-derived adipocytes. Compared with GFP controls, adenoviral overexpression of MKP1 ablated nicotine-induced p38 and JNK phosphorylation, blocked nicotine-induced Irs1 reduction, and reversed insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation ( In isolated white adipocytes, nicotine induced the nuclear translocation of AMPK\u03b12, but not AMPK\u03b11 ( We next explored the To further investigate the role of MKP1 in nicotine-induced IR Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor \u03b17 subunit (AchR\u03b17) is the major receptor for nicotine Further, we detected AchR\u03b17 expression in isolated adipocytes, hepatocytes, \u03b2-cells, and myocytes from wild-type mice. We found that clinically relevant concentrations of metformin (2\u201320 \u00b5M) had marginal effects in adipocytes on MKP1 expression compared to the strong effects that nicotine has on lowering MKP1 levels ( It was important to investigate if nicotine activated AMPK-MKP1-IRS1 signaling in the adipose tissue of smokers. We found higher pAMPK, and lower MKP1 and IRS1 in WAT in smokers compared to nonsmokers. Moreover, the blood glucose and plasma insulin response during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was significantly higher in smokers than nonsmokers ( Finally, there is evidence that that low dose nicotine (1.5 mg kg This study has shown, for what we believe is the first time, that AMPK\u03b12, but not AMPK\u03b11, is essential for nicotine-induced IR and aberrant lipolysis in WAT of mice Although AMPK-induced activation of the p38-JNK pathway has been reported in different cell types Several studies indicate that AMPK activation induces weight loss. First, AMPK activation is reported to inhibit insulin-mediated, anti-lipolysis-required IRS-Akt signaling Insulin is known to block lipolysis, increase body weight In summary, the data here shows that AMPK\u03b12 is essential for nicotine-induced lipolysis and whole body IR. Our results might help explain the paradoxical links of body weight loss and whole body IR in cigarette smokers. Additionally, the results also suggest that anti-lypolytic drugs such as acipimox might be useful for treating IR in smokers or in patients undergoing nicotine-based smoking cessation therapy. Skin temperature surrounding BAT was recorded with an infrared camera and analyzed with a specific software package (A325sc: Compact-Infrared-Thermal-Imaging-Camera; FLIR, West Malling, Kent, U.K.) The metabolic rate of mice was measured by indirect calorimetry measurements using Comprehensive Laboratory Animal Monitoring Systems (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Antibodies against AMPK-\u03b1 (2532), AMPK-\u03b11 (2795), AMPK-\u03b12(2757), pAMPK (Thr172, 2535), pACC (Ser79, 3661), ACC (3662), p38 (9212), pp38 (4631), JNK (9258), pJNK (9251), pIRS1 (Ser307, 2381), pIRS1 (Ser636/639, 2388), pIRS1 (Ser789, 2389), p-mTOR (Ser2448, 5536), mTOR (2983), pS6K (Thr389, 9324), S6K (2708), pRaptor (Ser789, 2083), Raptor (2280), pThr (9386) and histone H3 (9717) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. IRS1 (06-284) was from Sigma. Nicotine (Nic) perfusion induces IR and lower adiposity. ( Lipolysis inhibition blocks nicotine-induced IR and adiposity reduction. ( Deletion of AMPK\u03b12, but not AMPK\u03b11, blocks nicotine-induced IR and inhibition of weight gain in mice. ( MKP1 reduction is required for nicotine-mediated IR and lipolysis.", "Interestingly, IR precedes by several years the development of T2DM, making the study of cellular and molecular causes of IR an attractive area research for the development of new drugs and therapeutic strategies to treat or prevent the disease. However, the pathophysiology of IR in T2DM remains controversial, and treating insulin resistance is still a challenge. In particular, the IRS\u2013PI3K\u2013PKB\u2013FOXO pathway is crucial for metabolic activities of the hormone . IR is defined as the failure of cells to respond normally to insulin's glucose-lowering effects, resulting in hyperglycaemia. In skeletal muscle, IR induces a reduction of glucose uptake in response to insulin whereas, in the liver, IR leads to greater glycogenolysis and neoglucogenesis , thereby raising blood glucose levels. As for the molecular mechanisms of IR, the findings thus far have indicated that increased serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates IRS-1/IRS-2 might be implicated in the inhibition of insulin signalling in both tissues . This serine phosphorylation may also reduce the ability of IRS proteins to interact with the cytosolic domain of the insulin receptor concomitantly with a decreased ability of Src homology (SH)-containing proteins, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), to interact with IRS-1 and transfer insulin signals . In agreement with this, it was recently demonstrated that mutations of key serines of IRS-1 (Ser302, Ser307 and Ser612) prevent the development of diet-induced muscle IR in mice , thus confirming the critical role of these phosphorylation sites in the aetiology of IR. Several metabolic stresses in both liver and skeletal muscle are able to activate the serine/threonine kinases responsible for serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins, including lipid accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inflammation . Also, mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress have been independently associated with hepatic and muscle IR , whereas both antioxidants and inhibitors of ER stress have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in humans and in mouse models , suggesting a key independent role of these two organelles in the control of glucose homoeostasis. This review discusses independently the roles of mitochondria and ER in the development of IR, as well as the potential involvement of disruption of organelle crosstalk in alterations of insulin signalling. Numerous studies in humans and animal models indicate that IR is frequently associated with reduced mitochondrial mass or oxidative function in insulin-sensitive tissues, leading to the hypothesis that defective overall mitochondrial activity could play a relevant role in the aetiology of IR and, therefore, in T2DM. Some proposed mechanisms by which impaired mitochondrial function inhibits insulin signalling (A) include: However, the causal relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and IR is still controversial in both liver and skeletal muscle. Changes in lipid metabolism play an important role in the development of muscle IR. As mitochondria are the site of fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial alterations have been described in the muscle of diabetic patients , it has been suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction could contribute to the development of muscle IR. Different mitochondrial alterations in skeletal muscle, including reduced mitochondrial density and/or reduced oxidative phosphorylation capacity per mitochondrion, have been found in association with IR in numerous human and animal studies . In addition, modification of mitochondrial dynamics has been highlighted as a potential mechanism in muscle IR, as muscle from obese subjects and from T2DM patients has shown reduced expression of mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) , and amelioration of insulin sensitivity by bariatric surgery has been associated with increased Mfn2 expression in muscle . Nevertheless, other studies performed in mice with genetic ablation of different components of mitochondria have minimalized the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in muscle IR , and further interventional studies have also supported the controversy , questioning the causal implication of mitochondria in alterations of insulin signalling. Thus, it may be more prudent to conclude that mitochondrial dysfunction is most likely not causally involved in the development of muscle IR, although targeting it might be an effective way to improve insulin signalling in skeletal muscle and restore glucose homoeostasis . Hepatic IR contributes to fasting hyperglycaemia in diabetes patients and is associated with mitochondrial changes. It has been found that mitochondrial abnormalities associated with hepatic IR include ultrastructural lesions, depletion of mitochondrial DNA, decreased activity of respiratory chain complexes and impaired mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation . Mitochondrial oxidative capacity may be important for maintaining hepatic insulin sensitivity, as inhibition of mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation by long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency causes hepatic steatosis and hepatic IR , whereas enhancing liver mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in obese mice improves insulin sensitivity independently of hepatic steatosis . Nevertheless, the literature on the causative or compensatory nature of hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction in IR, particularly in humans, is less abundant. Some studies suggest that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is activated in liver when faced with obesity , whereas others suggest that OXPHOS deficiency may counteract the development of IR . This indicates a need for further studies into the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the liver in the aetiologies of IR and T2DM. This pathway is mediated by three transmembrane ER proteins : inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1); protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK); and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). ER stress increases BiP binding of luminal misfolded proteins, while titration away from IRE1, PERK and ATF6 leads to its activation. IRE1 activation results in the spicing of X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1) mRNA for translation of transcription factor Xbp1s. Although many studies have suggested that ER stress is involved in hepatic IR, its role in the development of muscle IR is still controversial. The first demonstration of the role of ER stress in hepatic IR came from studies by Uzcan et al. Interestingly, TUDCA treatment was also effective for hepatic insulin sensitivity in obese subjects , suggesting that chemical chaperones might be an effective pharmacological approach for treating hepatic IR. Activation of UPR is able to activate: Whereas both the implication of ER stress in hepatic IR and the mechanisms responsible for this effect are relatively clear, the causes of ER stress in the insulin-resistant liver are currently poorly defined. However, more recent studies demonstrated that exposure of human primary myotubes to palmitate can induce ER stress and that high-fat feeding can activate the UPR in mouse skeletal muscle , indicating that ER stress may be induced in lipotoxic states in skeletal muscle and be potentially involved in muscle IR. In addition, tunicamycin-induced ER stress in C2C12 or L6 muscle cells decreased insulin signalling through phosphorylation of IRS-1 through the IRE1/JNK pathway . Nevertheless, we also recently demonstrated that reduction of ER stress by chemical chaperones and Grp78 overexpression did not improve palmitate-induced alterations of insulin signalling in myotubes, suggesting that ER stress is not a major actor of muscle IR . Why ER stress plays only a minor role in lipid-induced IR in muscle compared with the liver and adipose tissue is as yet unclear. Consequently, it can be hypothesized that palmitate may induce muscle IR independently of JNK activation by acting directly on IRS-1 through activation of other stress-related kinases. Alternatively, palmitate could alter insulin action at the level of protein kinase B (PKB) independently of an effect on IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. Because mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with IR, palmitate-induced alterations of mitochondria may explain why reducing ER stress was not effective for improving insulin signalling in myotubes. Interestingly, IR is associated with a number of molecular events consistent with MAM modifications, including alterations of Ca and lipid homoeostasis, ER stress and mitochondrial changes, suggesting that structural and functional alterations of MAMs might be participating in altered insulin action in peripheral tissues. Interestingly, a reduction in ER\u2013mitochondrial crosstalk, achieved by liver-specific ablation of Mfn2, induces mitochondrial dysfunction, ER stress, IR and impaired glucose tolerance , while hepatic overexpression of Mfn2 using adenoviral approaches protected mice from diet-induced IR . Moreover, the alteration of MAM integrity in vivo by invalidation of mitochondrial cyclophilin D (cypD) in mice induced hepatic IR. Therefore, our data demonstrate for the first time a key role of MAM in the control of insulin action and in hepatic IR . However, it is still unclear whether changes in MAM integrity are a cause or consequence of IR. As MAMs control both ER and mitochondrial function, disrupted MAM integrity in the liver of diabetic mice may induce IR through ER stress and/or mitochondrial dysfunction. This is why MAM disruption could be the unifying mechanism promoting IR, thereby making it an interesting potential target for improving insulin sensitivity. Despite recent data pointing to a role of MAMs in IR, considerably more research efforts have to be made to understand the interplay and signalling specificity between the ER and mitochondria, and to clarify the role of MAMs in the pathophysiology of T2DM. More important, as MAM integrity impacts both mitochondria and ER function, it allows integration of the metabolic stresses classically associated with IR. In addition, new exciting questions are also emerging: Are MAM alterations a cause or a consequence of IR?", "The IR rabbit model was created by coronary artery ligation for 30 min, followed by reperfusion for 15 min in vivo in both HF and non-HF groups ( Reperfusion therapy by thrombolysis or immediate percutaneous coronary intervention is commonly performed for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Two rabbits died within 4 weeks of pacing initiation, and the hearts from the remaining 20 rabbits (11 with pacing-induced HF (the HF group) and 9 without pacemaker implantation (non-HF group)) were harvested for IR induction. There was no significant difference of baseline VPB burden between two groups ( The HF group had a significantly longer APD There was a tendency of a steeper mean maximum slope of APD The HF group had a slower CV than the non-HF group at baseline ( APD Dantrolene had no significant effects on Ca The HF group had a higher VF inducibility than the non-HF group at baseline (7 of 9 versus 2 of 9, In the non-HF group, VF was converted to VT and then stopped ( The DF We studied the effects of dantrolene on suppression of VPB and VF inducibility in post-IR injury hearts with and without pacing-induced HF. reported that reperfusion arrhythmias are initiated by enhanced pacemaker activity and maintained by localized and slowed conduction within IR regions [ Dantrolene prolongs APD, which by itself can decrease the DF Dantrolene has been shown to prevent VF storm in failing hearts with AMI [ Given that the electrophysiological studies were performed with Langendorff perfusion, it is possible that electrophysiological parameters may be different when the hearts are in situ and also caution is advised when extrapolating our model to clinical IR cardiac injury. Dashed lines indicate the border of IR zone; red arrows indicate the directions of wavefront propagation.

APD Asterisks denote values significantly different between non-IR and IR zones.", "Intact mice fed Western diet had higher serum insulin which was associated with significantly higher blood glucose and tumor tissue IR.", "Under acute dosing conditions, the large size of an IR-binding antibody like XMetA (\u223c 150 kDa) could lead to a more rapid access into liver, an insulin sensitive tissue with well-fenestrated capillaries, when compared to other insulin sensitive tissues with non-fenestrated capillaries, such as muscle and adipose. Thus, in the present study we administered XMetA (10 mg/kg) and insulin (0.5 U/kg) via IV injection, and for 90 min compared their effects on blood glucose lowering and IR activation in three of the major insulin-sensitive tissues of the normal fasted mouse: liver, adipose, and muscle. Insulin activated IR autophosphorylation and Akt phosphorylation in liver, fat, and muscle. In contrast, IR activation by XMetA was primarily observed in the liver.", "Here, we review the recent discoveries about miRNAs in cellular response to IR. IR directly damage cellular components or generate reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species that can disrupt atomic structure of macromolecules ( MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a newly discovered class of non-coding and endogenous RNA molecules that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level ( IR triggers several biochemical and signaling events and alters expression of many genes involved in cell cycle regulation, checkpoints, apoptosis, and signal transduction pathways ( The main toxic biological effect of IR is DNA single (SSB) or double (DSB) strand break. Cells are very sensitive to DNA breaks especially at late G2, and during M phase ( Following double-strand breaks by IR, the MRN complex binds to broken ends of DNA. This information is resulted from references (21-26) DSB activates p21 that inhibits cell proliferation by inactivating CDK-Cycline complexes IR not only causes cell death, but also has potential of enhancing proliferation in the surviving fraction of cells ( Recent evidences suggested that microRNA-mediated gene regulation interconnects with the radio-related signal transduction pathways.", "Grb14-IR complex formation is initiated by insulin stimulation, and the binding event results in the inhibition of insulin signalling. Thus, Grb14 is regarded as an endogenous suppressor of insulin signal transduction; however, there are no studies describing the mechanism whereby Grb14-IR complex formation is suppressed in the absence of insulin stimulation. Pharmacological inhibition as well as knockdown of GSK-3 facilitated complex formation between Grb14 and IR, implicating GSK-3 activity in regulating Grb14-IR binding. Grb14-IR binding was also facilitated by replacement of the serines with Ala. We also observed that Ser(366) of endogenous Grb14 in Hep G2 cell was phosphorylated and the phosphorylation was influenced by treatments with insulin, as well as the GSK-3 inhibitor.", "Lower levels of ROS in CSCs are associated with increased expression of free radical scavenging systems ( Therapeutic IR causes DNA damage and generates oxidative stress in cells leading to the activation of specific signaling pathways in the irradiated cells ( Working on a p53 null mammary tumor model, Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most aggressive human malignancies with rapid growth, high invasiveness and vascularity, treatment resistance, and a poor patient prognosis. IR, either alone or adjuvant after surgery, is part of standard treatment.

HOMA-IR index was calculated from FPG and insulin levels [FPG (mg/dl) \u00d7 insulin (\u03bcU/ml)/405] as a marker of IR. Because of skewed distributions, the natural logarithmic (ln) transformations were performed for triglycerides, insulin, HOMA-IR and vaspin. BMI ( < 0.05), insulin ( < 0.05), HOMA-IR ( < 0.01), c-IMT ( < 0.05) and hypertensive medication ( < 0.05) were positively associated with serum vaspin level, whereas eGFR ( < 0.05) was inversely associated. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that serum vaspin level was significantly and independently associated with eGFR ( < 0.01; inversely), HOMA-IR ( < 0.05) and c-IMT ( < 0.05) (). We found that HOMA-IR was not related to c-IMT, and vaspin was directly related to c-IMT although vaspin was related to both c-IMT and HOMA-IR. In this cross-sectional cohort study in a general population, multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that serum vaspin levels were significantly and independently associated with HOMA-IR index and c-IMT, markers of IR and carotid atherosclerosis, respectively. Moreover, a mediation analysis demonstrated that vaspin was directly related to c-IMT, independently of IR. Our results are consistent with previous studies showing a close association of serum vaspin level with IR in humans. Previously, it was demonstrated that serum vaspin levels were associated with not only IR but also BMI in adults , children and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome . Because obesity and IR are closely related, no association of BMI with vaspin levels in our study may be puzzling. However, our results suggest rather the direct effect of vaspin on atherosclerosis because the association of vaspin with c-IMT was independent of HOMA-IR. The mediation analysis demonstrated that vaspin was directly related to c-IMT, independently of IR ( with path diagram in the ). Second, our population was relatively healthy, and most of them had BMI, c-IMT and HOMA-IR index within normal limits. In conclusion, our data indicated that human circulating vaspin was positively and independently associated with HOMA-IR index and c-IMT in a general population.", "Furthermore, the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins were upregulated in CSCs via silencing 14-3-3\u03b6 after IR. First, we conducted a sphere-forming assay to confirm whether CD133 A western blot analysis was performed after IR to confirm whether 14-3-3\u03b6 expression was regulated between CD133 We established cell lines using LVs containing shRNAs of NC and 14-3-3\u03b6 (Zeta) to silence 14-3-3\u03b6. After silencing 14-3-3\u03b6, expression in LV-NC and LV-Zeta cells was analyzed by western blot analysis ( We explored whether silencing 14-3-3\u03b6 would affect the stemness characteristics of CSCs and cell viability in CD133 A sphere-forming assay was conducted to identify whether the silencing of 14-3-3\u03b6 would affect the self-renewal and differentiation capacity of CD133 The MTS assay revealed that CD133 The number of apoptotic cells (Annexin V-positive cells) increased in both LV-NC and LV-Zeta cells after IR, but no significant difference in the necrotic cells (PI-positive and Annexin V-negative cells) was noted between the groups ( We measured caspase-3/7 activity to determine whether radio-induced apoptosis was increased by 14-3-3\u03b6 knockdown. We found that silencing 14-3-3\u03b6 affected the cell viability of liver CSCs following exposure to IR. CSCs have extensive cell viability and a high survival rate because of their strong radioresistant characteristics after IR. We found that downregulation of 14-3-3\u03b6 in liver CSCs may increase the sensitivity to IR and significantly decrease cell viability following IR exposure ( An exploration of the mechanism underlying cellular and molecular radioresistance is essential to improve the therapeutic efficacy of radiation therapy for HCC. In this regard, our findings show that the expression of 14-3-3\u03b6 may be involved in the response to IR and that the knockdown of 14-3-3\u03b6 reduced the radioresistant characteristics of CSCs. We also demonstrated that stable depletion of 14-3-3\u03b6 reduced CSC stemness and enhanced radio-induced apoptosis following IR exposure. The MTS assay was performed at 0, 48 and 96 h in IR-exposed cells to investigate cell viability in LV-NC and LV-Zeta cells.", "Articles that evaluate the effect of the T45G polymorphism on IR and blood glucose were identified from the PubMed and Embase databases. Five indices, including fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (F-insulin), 2-h blood glucose (2-h BG), 2-h insulin, and homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), were used to assess the effects of the T45G polymorphism on IR and blood glucose under a dominant model. Twenty-two studies on FBG, 17 on F-insulin, 20 on HOMA-IR, and 3 on 2-h BG were included. This meta-analysis revealed no significant association between the ADIPOQ T45G polymorphism and IR and blood glucose in the overall population and subgroup subjects under a dominant model, regardless of whether FBG, F-insulin, 2-h BG, or HOMA-IR was used. The present meta-analysis indicated that the mutation allele may have no function in IR development. The ADIPOQ T45G polymorphism is not associated with IR and blood glucose.", "(A) Representative images of the wild type germarium containing PH3-stained germline cells (arrow) or somatic follicle cells (arrowhead) are shown in the absence of irradiation (-IR) or 1 h after irradiation (+IR). * In larval somatic cells, In addition to G2 arrest, larval somatic cells activate the S-phase checkpoint by slowing down DNA replication in response to IR in a The BrdU incorporation assay was performed in wild type and checkpoint mutant ovaries 1(A) Representative images of a wild type germarium assayed for BrdU incorporation (green) in the germline cells before and after irradiation are shown. In the absence of irradiation, the karyosome of all the oocytes observed at stages 3 (n = 24) and 6 (n = 21) appeared spherical ( (A\u2013B) Karyosome defects after IR treatment. (C) Representative images of a normal embryo from an untreated female (-IR) and a defective embryo from a wild type female irradiated at 40 Gy (+IR) are shown. Here, we have investigated a DNA damage response in the In the somatic cells of the In mammals, IR induces phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX within several minutes, reaching a maximum level of phosphorylation approximately 30 min after irradiation Two major developmental defects are induced by activation of the The changes in the egg production of the irradiated females seem to occur in three phases. Most of the IR-induced defects during oogenesis were restored by 4 days post irradiation, suggesting that the germline stem cells were able to maintain the genomic stability and resume normal oogenesis after the defective germline cells were removed during oogenesis.", "IR was defined by homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) scores. Pearson correlations were used to examine the associations of InsuTAG with HOMA-IR and other markers. Predictions of IR from InsuTAG were evaluated using multiple regression models. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were constructed to measure the sensitivity and specificity of InsuTAG values and to determine the optimum cut-off point for prediction of IR. InsuTAG was positively correlated with HOMA-IR (r = 0.86; p < 0.0001). InsuTAG is a strong predictor of IR accounting for 65.0% of the variation in HOMA-IR values after adjusting for potential confounders. Areas under the ROC curve showed that InsuTAG (0.93) has higher value than other known lipid markers for predicting IR, with a sensitivity and specificity of 84.15% and 86.88%. Thus, InsuTAG appears to be a potential feasible marker of IR and metabolic syndrome. Insulin, secreted by the pancreas, is one of the key anabolic hormones that tightly regulates glucose and lipid homeostasis Evidence of a relationship between TG and IR has escalated following the identification of \u201cmetabolic syndrome\u201d (MetS), a condition representing a cluster of metabolic abnormalities with central obesity and IR postulated as core components Recognition of the importance of IR have prompted the derivation of a number of indices and surrogate markers to quantify IR After screening the 618 participants recruited for the RHLS study with exclusion criteria, 486 participants were included in the analysis. Data reported as count, mean \u00b1 SD or median (IQR, expressed as the 25 There is a strong and highly significant positive correlation between InsuTAG and HOMA-IR (r = 0.86; p < 0.0001) (Fig. Scatterplot of InsuTAG and HOMA-IR. InsuTAG and HOMA-IR both log Correlations between contributors to insulin resistance, InsuTAG, and other surrogate markers of insulin resistance. *IR defined by HOMA-IR value, InsuTAG, TyG and TG/HDL-C log ROC curves of InsuTAG and surrogate markers of IR were plotted to compare the predictive values for IR and MetS (Fig. IR categorised as HOMA-IR \u22652.5. ROC curve for InsuTAG ( Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for identifying Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) using InsuTAG and HOMA-IR. Insulin resistance classified according to HOMA-IR \u22652.5. Data presented as mean \u00b1 SD or median (IQR, expressed as the 25 Many studies have evaluated lipid ratios, homeostatic models and individual metabolic variables for predicting IR HOMA-IR is the most common or frequently used index for assessing IR and closely mirrors HEC values AUC values from the ROC analysis showed that InsuTAG represented 93% probability of identifying individuals with IR in this study population, comparatively greater than the AUC\u2019s of other lipid markers. Since it is less feasible to conduct HEC in studies with larger sample sizes, InsuTAG values were compared with HOMA-IR values rather than insulin sensitivity index values from clamp studies. Longitudinal studies are required to evaluate whether InsuTAG can predict development of IR and MetS. Surrogate markers for IR are less invasive and closely mirror correlation with HEC for metabolic and CVD risk. A recently published paper In conclusion, we have proposed and evaluated a novel marker for IR that accounts for both fasting insulin and TG. This study substantiates and shows InsuTAG as a predictor of IR and a predictor of metabolic syndrome with higher sensitivity and specify values over other anthropometry and existing lipid surrogate indices. Further research is required to validate InsuTAG against HEC and determine whether it can accurately predict the development of IR and MetS in prospective studies. Fasting insulin and glucose were used to measure IR using HOMA-IR scores (fasting insulin \u00d7 fasting glucose/22.5). Study participants with HOMA-IR values \u22652.5 were categorised as insulin resistant. Standard multiple regression was used to assess the relationship of HOMA-IR with InsuTAG and other surrogate markers of IR, with and without adjustment for the potentially confounding variables: age, gender, WC and blood levels of CRP. Logistic regression was used to determine whether an increase in InsuTAG score was associated with increased odds of having IR or MetS. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for InsuTAG and other surrogate markers of IR to assess whether they were effective in identifying either IR and/or MetS. For each marker, the area under the curve (AUC) was compared against HOMA-IR using the Stata command The research on which this paper is based was conducted as part of the Retirement Health and Lifestyle Study, The University of Newcastle.", "This study investigated the protective function and mechanism of propylene glycol alginate sodium sulfate (PSS), a sulfated polysaccharide, in a mouse hepatic IR injury model. The expression of apoptosis- and autophagy-related proteins, and the activation of MAPK signal, including jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and P38 were all affected by PSS treatment compared with IR model controls. PSS protected the liver from IR injury by suppressing the MAPK signaling and down-regulating inflammation, apoptosis, and autophagy. Assessment of PSS treatment in IR-induced liver injury showing ( Expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 mRNA in liver samples 2, 8, and 24 h after reperfusion was assayed by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. Anti-inflammatory activity of PSS in IR injury as shown by ( Apoptosis occurring in liver tissue after IR and was evaluated using the TUNEL assay (Fig. Anti-apoptotic activity of PSS treatment in hepatic IR injury as shown by ( Autophagy increased with IR injury, and was inhibited by PSS. Western blots and quantitative RT-PCR assays of autophagy-related proteins and their mRNAs revealed upregulation of LC3 and Beclin-1 in IR model mice and downregulation of P62, changes that were inhibited by PSS pretreatment (Fig. Anti-autophagy activity of PSS pretreatment in hepatic IR injury as shown by ( As PSS treatment inhibited inflammation, apoptosis, and autophagy in liver tissue after IR, its effect on the MAPK pathway were investigated. Western blot assay of total and phosphorylated JNK, P38, and ERK expression found that PSS pretreatment significantly inhibited the activation of MAPKs that accompanied IR (Fig. Effects of PSS treatment on MAPKs in hepatic IR injury as shown by ( Hepatic IR injury is a pathophysiological event that influences post-surgery outcome. In experimental animal models, pharmacological preconditioning has successfully managed hepatic IR injury PSS pretreatment at both doses used, reduced the serum AST and ALT levels observed in the hepatic IR model mice without pretreatment. PSS pretreatment was also able to decrease the extent of hepatic necrosis, congestion, and edema produced by IR injury. The difference in the Suzuki criteria scores revealed PSS-related improvement in pathological changes characteristic of IR injury that were in line with the serological changes. The results consistently demonstrated that PSS pretreatment protected against hepatic IR injury. The causes of hepatic IR injury are not clearly known, but acute inflammation is conducive to its development The MAPK signaling pathway is active in the progression of IR injury, and the involvement three of its family members, c-jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular regulated kinases (ERK), and P38 MAPK in IR injury has been investigated Three cell death processes, necrosis, apoptosis, and autophagy are active in hepatic IR injury Autophagy is a conserved intracellular process and is involved in the pathogenesis of human diseases Despite many years of effort to prevent IR injury, its mechanisms are not well understood. PSS pretreatment had a consistent protective effect against hepatic IR injury because of its the anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic and anti-autophagic activity. Activation of the MAPKs during IR injury were inhibited with PSS pretreatment and may underlying the preventive effect of PSS on hepatic IR injury (Fig. Probable mechanisms of PSS pretreatment in protecting against hepatic IR injury. The P38 MAPK activated by IR downregulates the P62 expression, which in turn leads to an increase of LC3 and formation of autophagosomes that promote autophagic cellular death. Prior to surgery and establishment of the IR injury model, the mice were randomly assigned to seven groups of 18 animals each as shown in Table Group assignment and experimental procedures. Six mice in the sham operation, IR, PSS (25) +IR, and PSS (50) +IR groups were randomly anesthetized and sacrificed at 2, 8, and 24 h after reperfusion. Serum TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Anogen-Yes Biotech, Mississauga, Canada) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and indicated the severity of inflammation caused by IR. The severity of hepatic IR injury was blindly graded using Suzuki\u2019s criteria on a scale of 0 to 4 depending on the extent of sinusoidal congestion, hepatocyte necrosis, and ballooning degeneration. PSS treatment partly prevented hepatic IR injury by reducing inflammatory cytokines and apoptotic and autophagic cell death. Therefore, PSS has potential clinical value for preventing hepatic IR injury.", "In room air, IGF-1R did not change upon differentiation and was not affected by IGFs, whereas IR was increased in differentiating PMSCs and upregulated by IGF-1 (Figures Downstream kinases of IGF receptor signaling, p-ERK1/2 and p-AKT, are major signaling kinases to mediate an IGF effect. In a previous report, we noticed that low oxygen tension upregulates the levels of IGF-1R and IR [ IGF-1R and IR signaling pathways are indispensable for postnatal bone growth and turnover. Similar to Figures IGF-1R and IR levels and its isoforms (IR-A and IR-B) in differentiating PMSCS are regulated by oxygen tension and IGFs.", "A closer examination of the oscillating signal shows a significant anharmonicity, manifested in higher-order oscillations at frequencies of 4 We study the interferometer\u2019s dynamics by adding an additional degree of freedom, provided by a weak second harmonic (SH) field of the IR pulse. Applying the perturbative scheme, we measured the HHG spectrum as a function of both the XUV-IR and SH-IR delays. The intensity of each harmonic oscillates with half periodicity of the IR field in both degrees of freedom. The optimal XUV-IR delay of each harmonic order is equivalent to the one-dimensional results. Following the harmonic signal as a function of the SH-IR phase, we clearly observe out-of-phase oscillations of the even and odd harmonics (see Fig. To this end, we synchronize the SH and IR pulses in the source gas cell, allowing a direct control over the spectral components of the ionizing APT (see Methods section and Supplementary Note Perturbing both the ionization step and the strong-field recollision trajectories resolves the underlying dynamics that defines the different quantum paths in the XUV-initiated HHG process. Finally, the evolution of the wavepacket follows well-established strong-field trajectories Revealing the primary paths of the nonlinear mechanism provides us with the opportunity to trace the attosecond build-up of the electronic wavepacket, directed by the interplay of the XUV and the strong IR fields\u2019 interaction with the atomic system. The highly anharmonic response of the new harmonics to the XUV-IR delay scan is a clear sign of photo-ionization by photons carrying significantly lower energy than the helium ionization threshold; electrons are liberated by OBE rather than tunneling. Coherent nonlinear spectroscopic methods involving frequency up-conversion in the optical and IR regime are at the heart of vibrational and rotational spectroscopy. The IR beam is focused into the source gas cell where an attosecond pulse train (APT) is generated. The spectrum resulting from the interaction is measured in a grating-based XUV spectrograph For the XUV-IR delay scan experiment (Fig. In the CCTSM, the frequency dipole The APT and the IR field are treated as infinitely extended in time, a sufficiently good approximation for 25 fs IR pulses. The IR intensity used for the reconstruction is 8 \u00d7 10 We performed numerical calculations in order to solve the non-relativistic two-electron TDSE for the helium atom (for more details see Supplementary Note In order to model our experiment, we used a sine-square IR pulse with a peak intensity of 8 \u00d7 10 We performed a time\u2013frequency analysis of the dipole acceleration using a short-time Fourier (Gabor) transformation. The build-up of the XUV-initiated electron wavepacket is characterized by the complex ionization amplitudes Our measurement represents a multiple path quantum interferometer, controlled by the XUV-IR delay \u0394 We obtain a good agreement between experiment and theory as evidenced by the error bars (standard deviation) in Fig.", "A 6-week randomized controlled feeding trial was conducted to determine if a calorie-restricted, high-protein diet (~125 g protein/day consumed evenly throughout the day) using novel functional foods would be more successful for reducing IR in comparison to a conventional diet (~80 g protein/day) with a similar level of calorie restriction. The molecular mechanisms of this failure are complex, but appear to be intimately linked with increased inflammation [ IR is also modified by a change in lean mass relative to total mass in the absence of weight loss, and retention of lean mass over time predicts reductions in IR [ Hence, a calorie-restricted high-protein diet, with protein distributed evenly throughout the day may represent a particularly effective strategy for reducing IR under conditions of calorie restriction. This single-blinded, randomized controlled weight loss trial compared the efficacy of a standard, calorie-restricted control diet versus a protein-rich, calorie-restricted diet containing novel functional food products consumed at each meal daily, for reducing homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) while simultaneously increasing fat-free mass (FFM) in adults at risk for IR. Healthy adults by self-report (age 20\u201375 years; body mass index (BMI) 20\u201342 kg/m A fasting blood sample was collected from 92 consented adults (13 males) to determine the triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein (TG/HDL) ratio, an indicator of IR [ Participants recorded study compliance (daily cereal and pasta ingestion) on a calendar and recorded food intake daily in a written journal. Insulin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay (Millipore, St. Charles, MO, USA), and HOMA-IR was calculated as (fasting insulin \u03bcU/mL \u00d7 fasting glucose mg/dL)/405. Power calculations indicated that a total of 42 participants were necessary for this parallel-design study to detect a 2.0 unit difference in HOMA-IR [ Of the 39 participants randomized to treatment groups (19 CON; 20 HPR), eight did not return to the test site after the baseline visit, and an additional 10 participants withdrew prior to the end of the 6-week trial. Baseline age, body weight, BMI, and the TG/HDL ratio did not differ significantly between those who did not complete the trial ( Study compliance (the self-reported consumption of study foods daily) was 81 \u00b1 7% and 83 \u00b1 13% for the CON and HPR groups respectively ( Diet record analyses indicated that participants adhered to their meal plans, and daily nutrient intakes from non-experimental foods did not vary by group ( The 6-week change in plasma glucose and insulin, HOMA-IR, GLP-1, PYY, HMW-adiponectin, and lipids by group are shown in PYY concentrations decreased among all participants during the trial (\u221245% overall, Although strict calorie restriction will reduce IR, this controlled feeding trial demonstrated that the incorporation of novel high-quality protein functional food products at mealtimes with only modest calorie restriction significantly reduced IR in comparison to the use of control foods. However, the reduction in IR was significantly associated only with the increase of FFM. [ In comparison to these trials, calorie restriction was less (300 to 500 kcal) and the loss of body weight (2.7 to 3.2 kg) was modest for the 6-week trial reported herein; yet the reduction in HOMA-IR for the HPR group (\u22121.7) differed significantly from that for the control group (\u22120.7), and was greater than that noted for both the Tang et al. Hence, the purposeful distribution of high-quality protein across meals (>20 g/meal) and the fact the protein was of a novel functional form may be important considerations when planning calorie-restricted diets to improve IR. However, the differences in these techniques are proportional across measurements and likely related to the constants incorporated into the algorithms to estimate FFM using BIA [ This randomized controlled feeding trial demonstrated that a high protein diet (~125 g protein/day consumed in three evenly spaced meals) that include novel functional foods combined with modest calorie restriction was 140% more effective for reducing HOMA-IR in adults at risk for IR when compared to protein intake similar to a standard American diet (81 g protein/day; see [ This study was supported by a gift from the Inflammation Research Foundation, Peabody, MA, USA.", "Nutrition significantly impacts IR and weight loss reduces insulin levels, whereas weight gain increases the concentrations. Therefore, we surveyed the effect of nutrition intervention on IR in pregnant women and whether this effect is irrespective of weight gaining in accordance with Institute of Medicine limits. This trial decreased pregnancy-induced insulin increases ( The current intervention was effective to decrease pregnancy-induced insulin increases and IR. Thus, chronic IR is a basic component of the pathophysiology of GDM. [ Recent studies explained the role of IR in progress of hepatic lipogenesis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and atherogenic dyslipidemia. [ Studies indicate that nutrition significantly impact IR. The registration number is IRCT2016012026129N1. The data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software package (version 18, IBM Company, The United States) and Comparison of participants\u2019 characteristics and baseline values of blood parameters at the inclusion visit Comparison of baseline and follow-up values within and between study groups and gained weight groups Because IR would be impressed by weight gain, we used ANCOVA to analyze the mean of blood parameters in study groups and gained weight groups (considering adherence to IOM limits and not adherence). Baseline and follow-up values of blood parameters entered as covariate and dependent variables [ Nutrients intake was analyzed by paired Comparison of macronutrient and micronutrient intakes before and after intervention within and between study groups Before intervention, no significant differences were found between the two groups for any of the demographic characteristics, the mean of blood parameters, pregravid weight and BMI, and the mean of physical activity scores [ ANCOVA [ Because our nutrition education was effective on GWG in addition to insulin values, we used ANCOVA to adjust the effect of weight gaining on blood parameters [ This test demonstrated that control of GWG was more effective to decrease IR ( FPG concentrations did not change in study groups ( Paired The current nutrition education intervention decreased gestational insulin increases irrespective of weight control. Furthermore, our trial decreased IR which was more affected by maintaining gestational weight within the IOM limits and has not been widely studied. Wolff Thus, prevention of IR by nutrition education could be regarded for pregnant mothers. Coherently, Fraser According to our findings, lower fat and PUFA intake were associated with lesser HOMA-IR scores. Significant increases in Glutathione Peroxidase Activity and HOMA-IR consequently were correlated positively with dietary fat and PUFA intake in another study. To keep the number of words, we did not show the effect of the intervention on micronutrients and their association with IR. The current intervention was effective to decrease pregnancy-induced insulin increases and IR.", "Male Wistar rats were orally administered vehicle (CMC) once daily (sham and IR + control), febuxostat (10 mg/kg/day; FEB10 + IR), or allopurinol (100 mg/kg/day; ALL100 + IR) for 14 days. On the 15th day, the IR-control and treatment groups were subjected to one-stage left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery ligation for 45 minutes followed by a 60-minute reperfusion. Hence, thrombolytic therapy or primary percutaneous coronary intervention is imperative for salvaging the myocardium and improving clinical outcome [ There are substantial evidences that oxidative stress plays a crucial role in IR injury [ Xanthine oxidase (XO) is involved in free radical generation following hypoxia as well as during reperfusion [ Healthy adult male Wistar albino rats, 10 to 12 weeks old, weighing 150 to 200 g were used in the present study. The doses of febuxostat and allopurinol were chosen based on a dose-response study in our laboratory [ Group 1 (sham; Group 2 (IR-control; Group 3 (FEB10 + IR; Group 4 (ALL100 + IR; The experimental procedure followed for induction of ischemia and reperfusion and assessment of hemodynamic and ventricular function has been described by Agrawal et al. The value of During the course of this study, 4 out of 38 rats (translating to a mortality of 11%) died; one rat died in the IR-control group, two died in the FEB10 + IR group, and one died in ALL100 + IR group. Pretreatment with febuxostat (10 mg/kg) or allopurinol (100 mg/kg) significantly improved heart rate and MAP as compared to IR-control rats during reperfusion ( As depicted in As illustrated in The light microscopic examination of heart sections from the myocardial IR group showed myofibrillar membrane damage with extensive myonecrosis, edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration as compared to the light microscopic examination of heart sections from the sham group ( The underlying molecular mechanism through which XOI exerts protection following cardiac IR was evaluated. Photomicrographs represented in Although numerous studies have described the fundamental role of XO in IR injury, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibition of XO in cardiac IR injury are not known. We further explored the effect of febuxostat pretreatment on MAPK-mediated inflammation and observed that febuxostat pretreatment ameliorated the cardiac dysfunction induced by reperfusion injury, primarily via the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway and suppression of the p38/JNK/NF- The rat model of myocardial IR injury is a clinically relevant model and mimics the human pathophysiological condition. This IR model has been standardized as ischemia for 45 min followed by reperfusion for 60 min in our laboratory [ XO-mediated oxidative stress has been extensively demonstrated by numerous investigators [ The free radicals generated from the mitochondria induces DNA damage and membrane peroxidation that promotes outer membrane permeabilization and facilitates translocation of Bax and cytochrome C from the mitochondria to the cytosol with subsequent activation of caspases to initiate and execute apoptosis [ The components of the MAPK pathway are known to induce nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF- To conclude, using an experimental model of cardiac IR injury, our study provides convincing data on the improved efficacy of febuxostat in ameliorating the cardiac damage induced by IR injury following LAD coronary artery occlusion. IR + control: ischemia-reperfusion control; FEB10 + IR: febuxostat 10 mg/kg/day + ischemia-reperfusion; ALL100 + IR: allopurinol 100 mg/kg/day + ischemia-reperfusion.

Quercetin was administered intragastrically daily at two doses (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) for 5 days prior to IR injury. The expression levels of liver enzymes, inflammatory cytokines, and other marker proteins were determined at 2, 8, and 24 hours after IR. Transient episodes of liver IR always occur during liver transplantation, surgical liver resection, trauma, and hypovolemic shock [ Hepatic IR injury is commonplace in liver surgery, and the underlying mechanism responsible for this injury is diverse and complex. A large number of factors and mediators play important roles in IR injury [ Autophagy is involved in both healthy and diseased liver [ As proinflammatory cytokines, apoptosis, and autophagy play critical roles in hepatic IR injury, these factors should be carefully considered when choosing a drug to treat IR. Quercetin (3,3\u2032,4\u2032,5,7-pentahydroflavone, QE), a member of the flavonoid family, can be found in many types of fruits and vegetables [ Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which was discovered over 30 years ago, belongs to the family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [ In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the protective mechanisms of QE on hepatic IR injury. It is hypothesized that pretreatment with QE can attenuate apoptosis and autophagy induced by IR via the ERK/NF- Quercetin (QE), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and collagenase, and D-Hanks buffer were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). A mouse model of 70% hepatic warm ischemia was established based on a previously reported method [ QE was diluted with 0.9% saline to 12.5 mg/ml (for QE100) and 25 mg/ml (for QE200) and was administered intragastrically 0.2 ml once per day for 5 consecutive days [ Natural control group ( Vehicle group ( Low-QE group ( High-QE group ( Sham group ( IR group ( Low-QE + IR group ( High-QE + IR group ( For the first four groups, mice were sacrificed after five days, and for the other four groups, eight mice were randomly selected from each group and sacrificed at 2, 8, and 24 hours after IR. The necrotic or edematous areas, Western blotting results, and serum ALT and AST levels were analyzed using the Student's To ensure that the differences between the IR group and the pretreatment groups were all due to QE, we first measured the influence of QE and surgery on normal liver tissue. To assess the effects of QE on hepatic IR injury, we measured the levels of ALT and AST in sera. The results in Inflammation is an important cause of liver IR injury. Proinflammatory cytokines were detected to further understand the mechanism of IR injury. Therefore, we performed ELISA, real-time PCR, Western blotting, and histochemical staining to determine TNF- Previous studies have reported the participation of apoptosis in hepatic IR. Thus, to study the possible protective mechanism of QE on apoptosis during hepatic IR, we determined the levels of these factors. The mRNA and protein levels of LC3, Beclin-1, and P62 are shown in Figures Inflammation pathways play an essential role in hepatic IR injury. The results of Liver IR injury occurs in many clinical situations in surgery and is linked with increased morbidity and mortality. However, due to the complex underlying mechanism of hepatic IR, an effective strategy to protect against IR is unavailable. As it has been demonstrated that inflammation, apoptosis, and autophagy are main factors in IR damage, we hypothesized that QE could protect the liver from IR damage. The extent of liver damage after IR is usually assessed by increased serum levels of liver enzymes, mainly ALT and AST. In addition, the release of proinflammatory cytokines and the gene and protein expression of apoptosis and autophagy markers significantly increased in the IR group. Compared with the IR group, ALT and AST levels in the QE groups decreased in a dose-dependent manner, which indicated that QE protected the liver against injury. As the inflammatory response is a very important part of IR injury, we first determined the protein and gene levels of the proinflammatory cytokines, TNF- Furthermore, to verify the antiapoptosis effect of QE, we carried out qRT-PCR and Western blotting to detect the expression of caspase 3, caspase 9, Bax, and Bcl-2, which are markers of apoptosis. Apoptosis is a typical form of programmed cell death and can be regulated by inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF- ERK is a member of the MAPKs and plays a key role in cell signaling and is involved in many aspects of cell physiology, including proliferation, migration, differentiation, and death [ Autophagy is also a critical process in IR injury, and we measured the expression of Beclin-1, LC3, and P62 using Western blotting, qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry. When Bcl-2 is inactivated by NF- Thus, we found that cytokines activated the ERK/NF- Taken together, our findings showed that quercetin reduced hepatic IR injury in Balb/c mice. Notes: in IR-induced hepatitis, QE reduced apoptosis and autophagy by inhibiting ERK/NF- Nucleotide sequences of primers used for qRT-PCR.", "Scanning electron microscopy revealed that surface irregularities and physical disruption of spores coat are the major reasons behind the inactivation of IR treated fungal spores. It was also reported that IR treatment up to 70\u00b0C for 5 min does not cause any negative impact on the biochemical and physical properties of mung bean. From the results of the present study, it was concluded that IR treatment at 70\u00b0C for 5 min using IR source having intensity of 0.299 kW m -2 can be successfully used as a method of fungal decontamination.", "The combination of simvastatin with IR decreased G2/M arrest and delayed the repair of IR-induced DNA damage; however, no differences between the HCT116 p53+/+ and p53\u2011/- cells were evident. Interestingly, simvastatin induced radiosensitization by enhancing MDM2 suppression and elevating IR-induced p\u2011ATM foci formation compared with IR alone in HCT116 p53\u2011/- cells.", "The study demonstrates the protective effect of RUT and QRT against IR-induced DNA damage in human lymphocytes, which may be partly attributed to scavenging of IR-induced free radicals and also by the inhibition of IR-induced oxidative stress. Although many natural and synthetic/semi-synthetic chemicals have been investigated in the recent past for their efficacy to reduce adverse effects of IR,[ Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds containing a unique structure (diphenyl propane structure). IR alone group: The cultures of this group were exposed to different doses (0\u20134 Gy) of gamma radiation RUT and QRT + IR group: The cultures in this group were treated with optimum concentration (10 \u03bcg/ml) of RUT and QRT for 1 h before exposure to different doses (0\u20134 Gy) of gamma radiation. The values of CBPI in IR alone showed delay in cell proliferation. RUT pretreatment modulated the proliferative activity in the combination groups with an increase in CBPI, indicating surmount of cytotoxic effects caused by IR [ Effect of radiation on cytokinesis blocked proliferation index values in the human lymphocytes cells exposed to 2 Gy gamma radiation The optimal dose of RUT, 25 \u03bcg/ml with the greatest reduction in MN, was further used in combination with various doses of gamma radiation (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 Gy) exposed 1 h after RUT treatment to assess the antigenotoxic potential even at the higher doses of radiation [ Frequency of micronuclei and percentage inhibition in human lymphocytes cells treated with 25 \u03bcg/mL of rutin before exposure to different doses of gamma radiation Human lymphocytes cells treated with 2 Gy of radiation caused a significant ( The optimum protective dose of the RUT was selected by treating human lymphocytes cells with 0, 5, 10, 25 \u03bcg/ml RUT for 1 h before exposure to 2 Gy of gamma radiation at 60 min of postirradiation time. Treatment of lymphocytes with different doses of gamma radiation caused elevation in the DNA damage in a linear dose dependent manner ( IR is a physical agent known to induce mutations, chromosomal aberrations and considered as a Group I potential human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. [ IR, as many other cytotoxic agents, may induce whole chromosomes or chromosome fragments that do not attach to the spindle apparatus during mitosis. They caused a moderate decrease in CBPI with decline in total number of MN in gamma irradiated samples at all the tested concentrations when compared with IR alone group indicating its antigenotoxic potential. Genotoxic effects of IR are also mediated through formation of free radicals or ROS/RNS, which additionally cause DNA single-strand or double-strand breaks, alkali-labile, and in excision repair sites. Pretreatment of lymphocytes with RUT and QRT alone was found to be nontoxic at the concentration used and in combination with IR showed a significant suppression of morphological changes with a reduction in MN induction and DNA damage.", "One unique feature of the signaling mechanism used by IR is that its activated tyrosine kinase phosphorylates adaptor or docking proteins, such as IRS-1, IRS-2, Gab1 and Shc, which subsequently recruit various SH2-domain-containing effector proteins leading, for instance, to the activation of the MAP kinase or the PI-3 kinase pathways (reviews ). Some effector proteins can also bind directly to the cytoplasmic domain of IR. Transgenic mice expressing human IR cDNA under the control of the myosin light chain-2 (MLC-2) gene promoter/enhancer have been generated . Other transgenic mice expressing human IR cDNA encoding a tyrosine kinase-deficient form under the control of the native promoter did not show any glucose intolerance, probably due to limited expression of the transgene . Expression of human IR cDNA encoding another tyrosine kinase-deficient dominant negative form in skeletal and cardiac muscle was achieved in transgenic mice using the muscle creatine kinase gene promoter . This resulted in impaired insulin-stimulated IR tyrosine kinase activity in muscle along with defective activation of downstream signaling proteins such as IRS-1 and PI-3 kinase . Finally, expression in transgenic mice of the extracellular domain of human IR in a soluble form using the mouse transferrin gene promoter resulted in altered glucose homeostasis . More recently, mice carrying a null mutation in the IR gene have been reported . Marked postnatal skeletal muscle hypotrophy and growth retardation were observed, and the IR-deficient pups finally died within 1 week after birth. Homozygous mice carrying a null mutation in the IRS-1 gene showed intra-uterine and postnatal growth retardation . However, IRS-1-deficient mice did not present any major metabolic disorders, indicating that IRS-1 can be replaced by other homologous docking proteins of insulin signaling. G deficiency increased the activities of protein tyrosine phosphatases and reduced IRS-1 phosphorylation.", "The purpose of this study is to determine if IR is related to cardiovascular function independent of DM or hypertension among African Americans (AA). IR was calculated using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR). SV, CO and VCI decreased with increasing HOMA-IR whereas HR and PVRI increased. Overall, BP, HR, and PVRI were positively correlated with HOMA-IR (p<0.01); and SV index, cardiac index, and VCI were negatively correlated with HOMA-IR (p<0.0001). In addition, multiple linear regression analyses showed that HOMA-IR contributes to the maximum variability of all the hemodynamic variables. BP responses to math stress and norepinephrine infusion did not correlate with HOMA-IR. Unrelated to DM and BP, IR is associated with increased PVRI and decreased CO in AA. These observations suggest that an exclusive focus on effects of IR on DM or BP may ignore independent pathophysiologic contributions of IR to CVD. Insulin resistance was calculated with the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) index, a web-based program made available by Oxford University ( Continuous variables were reported as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Age and gender adjusted partial correlations of HOMA-IR with hemodynamic variables were identified by Spearman correlation analysis. A step-wise backward multiple regression analyses was performed for each dependent characteristic beginning with age, gender, HOMA-IR, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and plasma aldosterone. Fifty one percent of normotensive subjects and 51.5% of hypertensives were female ( Overall, combining normotensive and hypertensive subjects, HOMA-IR was correlated positively (p< 0.01) with average 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures ( The results of the step-wise multiple linear regression analyses to identify the independent predictors of hemodynamic variables are shown in To further evaluate the relationship of insulin resistance with blood pressure and its physiologic determinants, all subjects were grouped by tertiles of HOMA-IR ( Both in response to mental stress and to graded norepinephrine infusions, the increases of blood pressure in hypertensive subjects were greater than the increases in normotensive subjects (p < 0.05). Compared with whites, African Americans have a higher prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, stroke, and chronic kidney disease ( Panel A depicts the positive correlation between insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and heart rate (HR) Panel B depicts the positive correlation between HOMA-IR and peripheral vascular resistance index (PVRI) P-value * \u22640.05 ** \u22640.01 ***\u22640.001 Association of HOMA-IR with hemodynamic traits.

Thus TP508 may offer a novel approach in cardioprotection from IR injury in diabetic patients. While many drugs have demonstrated a significant benefit in reducing myocardial necrosis in pre-clinical studies, there is no drug on the market that has been found to lessen myocardial IR injury in clinical trials TP508 (also known as rusalatide acetate or Chrysalin\u00ae) is a 23- amino acid peptide from a portion of highly conserved, non-catalytic, receptor-binding domain in the native thrombin molecule, whose half life in serum is 10\u201314 minutes. Endothelium-dependent relaxation to ADP treatment was slightly improved in the DMT group compared to the DM group, but the difference was only of borderline significance (p=0.09) ( The expression of Akt was higher in the DMT group (p=0.04, There have been numerous studies examining the effects of drugs on myocardial IR injury in animal models, and nearly all have reported positive results, The key finding of this study is that TP508 provides significant myocardial protection in a type 1 diabetic swine during IR injury. Recently, we examined the effects of type 1 diabetes alone in a porcine model of IR, and found that, surprisingly, diabetes alone was associated with decreased myocardial necrosis (Osipov RM, MD, unpublished data submitted for publication, 2010). The current study demonstrates that treatment with TP508 in the setting of type I diabetes offers additional cardioprotection against IR injury, reducing infarct size by over 70% compared to diabetic control animals. IR injury has been shown to increase the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias The balance between cell death and cell survival proteins plays a crucial role in cell fate after myocardial IR injury TP508 has also been found to stimulate nitric oxide production in human endothelial cells While providing important functional and molecular data about the role of diabetes in acute IR, this study has several limitations. This is true of many trials examining the effects of drugs on IR injury, regenerative therapies, and other cardiovascular mediations. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that parenteral administration of TP508 provides significant myocardial protection in hyperglycemic pigs following acute myocardial IR.", "In the nucleus, IR causes many types of damage to DNA, including ionization of bases and sugars, the formation of strand (DNA-DNA) and DNA-protein cross-links, as well as the formation of single and double DNA strand breaks. Therefore, IR exposure produces a heterogeneous cluster of DNA damage as a consequence of the spatial distribution of energy deposition. The most biologically significant effect of IR on the cell, in terms of cell survival and chromosomal breakage, is the formation of a DNA double strand break (DSB), which occurs in approximately 16-40 locations of a diploid genome for every 1 Gy of low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation absorbed by a cell. Although DSBs are therefore a relatively infrequent type of damage sustained by DNA after IR exposure, they are thought to be the primary lethal event in most cells The repair of DNA DSBs is a complex biological process that is carried out by one of two pathways of DNA repair: non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). Although the predominant method of repairing DNA DSBs caused by IR is by NHEJ, there is a growing view that DSBs in cancer cells may be frequently repaired by HR Over the last several years, many components of HR have been elucidated. Strand invasion leads to displacement on one strand of the intact DNA duplex and the formation of a \u201cD-loop\u201d, which is the simplest form of HR and can directly act as the template for repairing the DSB (see As the region of strand exchange extends, at some point in this process the replication fork-like structure converts into a 4-strand structure behind the invading 3'strand, known as a Holliday Junction ( The complexity of the many steps involved in HR results in a large variety of proteins being utilized, which include: RAD51, RAD51-paralogues (XRCC2, XRCC3, RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D), RAD52, RAD54, BRCA2, RPA and many other associated proteins (see As expected, defects in any of the steps of HR can lead to impairment of the repair of DNA damage, including DSBs caused by IR. Erlotinib has been found to cause several cellular effects which could modify the cellular response to radiation, including attenuation of RAD51 expression Inhibitors of the ubiquitin/proteasome system are in various phases of preclinical and clinical development, and several have been shown to modulate the biologic response to IR, including bortezomib and nelfinavir Members of a relatively new class of drugs, the histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) have demonstrated a range of radiation modulating effects in a number of studies While PARP is not an essential element of the HR pathway, stalled replication forks are frequently repaired by HR, and thus, as a critical component of this process, PARP may be an attractive target for combined therapy with radiation. Although several drugs with pre-clinical evidence of affecting the HR pathway and modulating the biologic response to IR are being studied in clinical trials, there has been relatively sparse biomarker collection to confirm this effect.", "Continuous propofol infusion and regional anesthesia techniques attenuate lipid peroxidation and IR injury connected with tourniquet application in pediatric extremity surgery.", "Thus, promoting tumor cell sensitivity to IR could significantly enhance the treatment outcome and quality of life for patients. Mammary tumor cells were treated by a 16-base phosphodiester-linked oligonucleotide homologous to the telomere G-rich sequence TTAGGG (T-oligo: GGTTAGGTGTAGGTTT) or a control-oligo (the partial complement, TAACCCTAACCCTAAC) followed by IR. Thus, promoting tumor cell sensitivity to IR could significantly enhance the treatment outcome and quality of life for patients. Twenty-four hours after radiation, the cells were washed in PBS and fixed with formaldehyde/gluteradlehyde solution (5.6% formaldehyde, 0.4% gluteraldehyde in PBS) for 10 minutes at room temperature and stained with an X-gal mixture (40 mM Citrate/Na To determine apoptosis in tumor cells treated with T-oligo and radiation, TUNEL staining was performed using ApopTag Plus peroxidase kit (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) in a method previously described with some modification [ To assess the growth potential of T-oligo and IR-treated tumor cells in mice, mammary tumor cells were supplemented in culture with T-oligo for 24 hours, and then irradiated with 3 Gy. The mammary glands (chest area) were irradiated with 3 Gy IR with the rest of the body covered by lead foil. The cells were collected and counted at 0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after exposure to 3 Gy IR. However, inhibition was significantly enhanced after IR and significant inhibitory effects were observed in tumor cells treated with 30 to 40 \u03bcM T-oligo and 3 Gy IR (Figure The clonogenic cell survival assay is the gold standard to measure the radiosensitivity of cells. As shown in Figure To investigate potential mechanisms behind radiosensitization of tumor cells by T-oligo, we next examined the levels of nuclear-foci containing phosphorylated H2AX (H2AX), a modification that occurs at sites of DNA breaks [ As the above studies show that cells pretreated with T-oligo are more sensitive to IR, we next determined whether the treated cells undergo senescence or apoptosis. Although T-oligos do not act as telomerase inhibitors [ Regardless of its mechanism of action, T-oligo pretreatment increased tumor cell sensitivity to radiation as demonstrated by the clonogenic assay (Figure The murine mammary tumor induced by PyMT shares many features with poor-prognosis human breast cancer such as a high frequency of distant metastases, persistent expression of biomarkers, ErbB2/Neu and cyclin D1, and loss of estrogen and progesterone receptor expression [ In this study, we demonstrated that pretreatment with T-oligo sensitizes mammary tumor cells to radiation \u03b2-gal: \u03b2-galactosidase; \u03b3H2AX: phosphorylated histone H2AX; DDR: DNA damage response; DSB: double-strand DNA breaks; IR: Ionizing radiation; PyMT: polyomavirus middle T oncogene; Tg: transgenic; T-oligos: oligonucleotides homologous to the telomere G-rich sequence TTAGGG; TUNEL assay: terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling assay.", "Three other animals served as non-IR controls. Local blood flow rate in glands was measured pre- and post-IR with an ultrasonic Doppler analyzer. Samples of parotid gland tissue were taken at 4 h, 24 h, 1 week, and 2 weeks after IR for microvascular density (MVD) analysis and sphingomyelinase (SMase) assay. The activity of acid and neutral Mg Local parotid gland blood flow rate decreased rapidly at 4 h post-IR and remained below control levels throughout the 14-day observation period. The activity levels of ASMase and NSMase in parotid glands increased rapidly from 4 to 24 h post-IR and then declined gradually. Single-dose IR led to a significant reduction of MVD and local blood flow rate, indicating marked damage to microvascular endothelial cells in miniature pig parotid glands. The significant and rapid increases of ASMase and NSMase activity levels may be important in this IR-induced damage. However, SG acinar cells, which are the sole site of fluid secretion in this tissue, although highly radiosensitive, are well-differentiated cells exhibiting a low mitotic rate ( Endothelium has long been recognized as a principal target for IR injury to lung and brain ( These experiments were performed on nine inbred, healthy male miniature pigs, 9 months of age, weighing 30 to 40 kg, which were obtained from the Institute of Animal Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. A single dose of IR (25Gy, 6mV of photon energy at 3.33Gy/min; Department of Radiation Oncology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China) was delivered via an electronic linear accelerator (600C;Varian, Inc.) directed at bothparotidglandsof6miniature pigs by utilizing the three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy technique ( Local blood flow in parotid glands was measured prior to IR and at 4 h, 24 h, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days, 10 days, and 2 weeks post-IR by an ultrasonic Doppler blood flow rate analyzer (2 MHz detector, 40-mm depth, 160% power, 4 plus; JYQTCD-2000; Kingrich Science and Trade Co., P. R. China). One-way and two-way analyses of variance were used to analyze data, with a A maximum decline of parotid blood flow rate was observed at 4 h after IR ( At 4 h after IR, there was some eosinophilic fiber-like structure in the basement membrane region around acini ( At 4 h after IR, the parotid MVD decreased by ~20% (when measured by CD31 immunostaining) or was essentially unchanged (when measured by AQP1 immunostaining). However, at 24 h after IR, both CD31 and AQP1 immunolabeling showed similar and marked MVD losses; with CD31 staining, the MVD was ~72% of values of a control group that did not receive any IR, while with AQP1 staining, it was reduced to ~79% ( Irradiation led to a marked increase in the frequency of apoptotic nuclei detected in miniature pig parotid glands ( From 4 to 24 h after IR, SMase activity in parotid glands increased rapidly and then declined gradually after 1 to 2 weeks ( The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that microvascular endothelial cells are targets of IR damage in parotid glands of a large animal model, the miniature pig. This is an extremely useful animal model for studies of IR-induced salivary hypofunction and, importantly, is ~1,000-fold larger than that in mice ( Previous studies have suggested that SMase activity, leading to endothelial cell apoptosis, can contribute to IR-induced damage in the intestine, brain, and lungs of wild-type mice ( Interestingly, several studies demonstrated that ASMase-deficient T and B lymphocytes, rodent embryonic fibroblasts, oocytes, and endothelial cells failed to release ceramide on IR and, indeed, were resistant to \u03b3-IR-induced cell death ( Since SMase appears to play a critical role in mediating IR-induced endothelial apoptosis both Compared with small animal models, such as mice and rats, large animal models are especially valuable for studying many features of human pathologies, as well as for developing preclinical therapies. The oral and maxillofacial regions of miniature pigs, including the salivary glands, are similar to that of humans in anatomy, development, physiology, pathophysiology, and disease occurrence ( In summary, we have shown that single-dose IR rapidly leads to changes in microvascular endothelial cells and blood flow in miniature pig parotid glands. Sections of non-IR parotid glands (G\u2013I) and 4 h (A\u2013C) or 24 h (D\u2013F) after IR are shown. Also, the percentage of CD31-positive (blue, thick arrow, B\u2013I) cells with apoptotic nuclei was assayed, and the results showed significant differences between the non-IR and IR groups, both in total apoptotic nuclei (", "Three other animals served as non-IR controls. Local blood flow rate in glands was measured pre- and post-IR with an ultrasonic Doppler analyzer. Samples of parotid gland tissue were taken at 4 h, 24 h, 1 week, and 2 weeks after IR for microvascular density (MVD) analysis and sphingomyelinase (SMase) assay. The activity of acid and neutral Mg Local parotid gland blood flow rate decreased rapidly at 4 h post-IR and remained below control levels throughout the 14-day observation period. The activity levels of ASMase and NSMase in parotid glands increased rapidly from 4 to 24 h post-IR and then declined gradually. Single-dose IR led to a significant reduction of MVD and local blood flow rate, indicating marked damage to microvascular endothelial cells in miniature pig parotid glands.

However, the delayed or long-term biological effects of mild-doses of IR remain largely unknown. A set of 464 genes was also selected by a less stringent approach, and we demonstrate that this broader set of genes can efficiently distinguish the irradiated samples from the unirradiated, defining a long-term IR signature in human primary fibroblasts. Our findings support the existence of persistent responses to mild doses of IR detectable by changes in gene expression profiles.", "Decitabine and IR improve immunogenicity and susceptibility of tumor cells to immune cells by up-regulating the expression of various molecules such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I; natural-killer group 2, member D (NKG2D) ligands; and co-stimulatory molecules. However, the effects of combining decitabine and IR therapies are largely unknown. Our results indicate that decitabine or IR treatment upregulates MHC class I, along with various co-stimulatory molecules in target tumor cells. Furthermore, decitabine and IR combination treatment further upregulates MHC class I, along with the co-stimulatory molecules, when compared to the effect of each treatment alone. Importantly, decitabine treatment further enhanced T cell-mediated cytotoxicity and release of IFN- \u03b3 against target tumor cells which is induced by IR. IR-induced cancer cell death provides a good source of antigens for DC uptake and presentation to T cells The immune system uses human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) to distinguish between self and non-self cells. Furthermore, MHC class I-deficient tumors or infected cells are highly sensitive to NK cells While previous studies have focused on the effects of decitabine or IR treatment alone, their combined effects on the activity of immune cells have not been reported. In this study, we investigated whether decitabine and IR combination treatment enhances tumor cell susceptibility to immune cells, with a focus on T cells. Treatment with decitabine at a concentration of 0\u20135 \u03bcM caused no cytotoxicity in tumor cell lines; however, the highest decitabine concentration tested (10 \u03bcM) resulted in approximately 20% inhibition of cell growth compared with that in controls in A549 cells ( IR and epigenetic modulating agents are known to enhance the expression of several genes in tumor cells, including MHC class I and its co-stimulatory molecules Decitabine and IR combination treatment significantly increased MHC class I and co-stimulatory molecules in tumor cells ( Release of immunomodulatory cytokines such as IFN- \u03b3 is one of the major functions of anti-tumor immunity. Tumor cells treated with decitabine and IR alone and in combination were co-cultured with T cells, and IFN-\u03b3 levels were subsequently determined in the culture supernatants. Treatment with decitabine and IR alone significantly increased IFN-\u03b3 production in T cells compared with untreated target tumor cells; furthermore, the decitabine and IR combination treatment significantly increased IFN-\u03b3 levels compared with either treatment alone ( To investigate whether decitabine and IR combination treatment up-regulates NKG2D ligand expression in tumor cells, A549, HCT-116, and HepG2 cells were treated with 5 \u03bcM decitabine for 24 h. Then, the tumor cells were exposed to radiation doses of 8 Gy. NKG2D ligand cell surface expression was quantified using mean fluorescent intensities (MFIs) ( To investigate whether decitabine and IR combination treatment affects NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in target tumor cells, NK cells were co-cultured with decitabine, IR, or their combination-treated target tumor cells at various ratios for 4 h. Subsequently, a cytotoxicity assay was performed using flow cytometry. NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against decitabine or IR-treated target tumor cells was slightly decreased in comparison to untreated target tumor cells ( Tumor cells treated with decitabine and/or IR were co-cultured with NK cells for 4 h, and IFN-\u03b3 levels were subsequently determined in the culture supernatants. As shown in Various genes are abnormally silenced by DNA methylation and these genes are closely associated with immune response and drug sensitivity in cancer cells Immune evasion mechanisms of tumors are a major obstacle to successful tumor immunotherapy NK cells play a crucial role in tumor immune surveillance and are one of the promising therapeutic options for various malignant diseases The NK cell inhibitory signal is regulated through KIRs binding to MHC class I molecules expressed on tumor cells. Decitabine, IR, their combination, and vehicle-treated A549, HCT-116, and HepG2 cells fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde were used as stimulator cells. Differences were considered statistically significant at This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (DIRAMS) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIP) (50595-2016) Cells were seeded at an initial density of 1 \u00d7 10 Tumor cells were treated with 5 \u03bcM decitabine for 24 h then exposed to radiation doses of 8 Gy. After 24 h, cells were harvested and the expression of MHC class 1 molecule in various tumor cells ( T cells were co-cultured with decitabine, IR or both treated tumor cells (A549, HCT-116, and HepG2 cells) for 5days for MLR assay. Also, T cells were co-cultured with decitabine, IR or both treated tumor cells at various ratios for 4 h for cytotoxicity assay. T cell proliferation ( T cells were co-cultured with decitabine, IR or both treated tumor cells (A549, HCT-116, and HepG2 cells) for 4 h ( NKG2D ligand expression in A549 cells ( NK cells were co-cultured with A549, HCT-116, and HepG2 cells at various ratios for 4 h, and cytotoxicity assay was performed by flow cytometry. Tumor cells treated with decitabine and/or IR were co-cultured with NK cells for 4 h. Then the cell supernatants were harvested and analyzed by ELISA.", "Our aims were to evaluate the relationship between BCAA and IR as well as later diabetes risk and explore the phenotypic and genetic factors influencing BCAA level based on available studies. Based on current evidence, we found that BCAA is a useful biomarker for early detection of IR and later diabetic risk. Genes related to BCAA catabolism might serve as potential targets for the treatment of IR associated metabolic disorders. In the future, more large-scale studies with elaborate design addressing BCAA and IR are required. The following inclusion criteria were applied: (1) all subjects should be adults, which means that age is >18 years and <65 years; (2) participants should be free of any thyroid or metabolic disorders requiring treatment such as diabetes, hypertension, severe dyslipidemia, and coronary heart disease; (3) studies need to include adiposity measures (such as BMI or waist circumference) and HOMA-IR according to the formula glucose (mmol/L) \u00d7 insulin (pg/mL)/22.5 [ Studies were excluded if subjects were <18 or >65 years old, or were pregnant, or had diabetes, or had other chronic diseases, or had medication history. Included studies revealed significant alterations of BCAA in obese adults and the intimate association between BCAA and IR. [ Despite the altered BCAA level in peripheral circulation, BCAA metabolism in target tissue such as subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) also showed significant changes in obese and insulin resistant patients [ After evaluating all included studies, six prospective studies were found reporting the relationship between elevated BCAAs and later risk of type 2 diabetes [ Multiple factors have shown to influence the concentration of BCAA and its correlation with IR. The metabolism of BCAA has been known as a significant factor in the pathophysiology of many multifactorial diseases, such as metabolic syndrome, cancer, and hepatic disease [ Changes in However, the mechanism between BCAA and IR remains unclear [ The factors influencing BCAA level and its relationship with IR in this study mainly refer to race, gender, diet, and gene variants. First of all, after generating available studies on different ethnicities, we found that Asian people (Chinese or Japanese) seemed to be more susceptible to higher HOMA-IR and higher BCAA level compared with western people such as Caucasians or Europeans. Although Asian people usually hold lower BMI, studies have shown their higher susceptibility to impaired islet function at the early stages of metabolic disorders [ The influence of dietary pattern on BCAA level and IR was not established yet. [ BCAAs (valine, leucine, and isoleucine) can be an important and useful biomarker of IR. In a randomized, double-blind, controlled study on 25 overweight/obese adults [ Based on current studies, we found that BCAAs could be useful biomarker for IR and predictor for later diabetes risks. To our knowledge, this is the first review focusing on the relationship between BCAA and IR as well as the factors influencing BCAA level. In conclusion, this systematic review highlighted BCAAs (valine, leucine, and isoleucine) as useful biomarkers for early detection and diagnosis of IR in nondiabetic patients with obesity and as a valuable predictor for later risk of T2DM. Based on included studies, we found that differences in ethnicity, sex, gene expression, and dietary pattern can influence BCAA level and its relationship with IR. Future studies should focus on the mechanism of BCAA and IR in different tissues and explore the potential treatment targets for obesity and T2DM.

Here we found that Caveolin-3 binds to low glycosylated EMMPRIN (LG-EMMPRIN) in cardiac cells and in the hearts of healthy mice, whereas IR disrupted the complex in nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) knockout (KO) mice. The first domain is required for MMP activation in high-glycosylated EMMPRIN oligomers at the cell surface of many cell types [ In the present work we investigated the contribution of NO in the interaction between Caveolin-3 and EMMPRIN during a IR, as a mechanism to prevent ECM degradation in cardiac myocytes. IR induces the expression of EMMPRIN in the hearts of WT and NOS2 KO mice, as detected 48 hours after reperfusion ( Immunoblot detection of EMMPRIN in WT and NOS2 KO mice 48 hours after IR. (A) Confocal microscopy detection of Caveolin-3 (FITC, green), and EMMPRIN (Cy3, red) in heart sections from WT and NOS KO mice 48 hours after IR with specific antibodies. Immunoblot detection of Caveolin-3 from heart lysates after IR at the times indicated. To test whether IR could regulate glycosylation of EMMPRIN, we first immunoprecipitated heart protein lysates isolated 12h, 24h, and 48 hours after IR with anti-EMMPRIN antibodies ( (A) Immunoblot (IB) detection of Caveolin-3 from immunoprecipitated extracts (IP) with anti-EMMPRIN antibody, isolated from heart lysates of mice under IR at the times indicated. Immunoblot detection of EMMPRIN from total lysates or immunoprecipitated extracts with anti-Caveolin-3, and isolated from mouse hearts 48 hours after IR. Immunoblot detection of Caveolin-3 from immunoprecipitated extracts with anti-EMMPRIN and isolated from WT and NOS2 KO hearts isolated 48 hours after IR. We show that in NOS2 KO heart protein lysates subjected to discontinuous sucrose gradient fractionation, Caveolin-3 distribution shifted from fractions of lower (buoyant fractions (BF) 2, 3, 4) to higher (non buoyant fractions (NBF) 8, 9, and 10) density ( To assess whether NOS2 may induce cardiac protection by promoting the binding between Caveolin-3 and LG-EMMPRIN, we found that in Caveolin-3 KO mice subjected to IR, infarct sizes ( (A) Infarct size of WT and Caveolin-3 KO hearts 48 hours after IR, as detected by double Evans Blue/TTC staining (n = 9 mice/group; mean \u00b1 SD; *p <0.05) (B) LVEF in the same mice as before (mean \u00b1 SD; *p <0.05, WT IR vs Caveolin-3 KO IR). (C) Infarct size 48 hours after IR of NOS2 KO and Caveolin-3 KO mice and infused with saline or DEA-NO (n = 9 mice/group; mean \u00b1 SD; *p <0.05 NOS2 KO saline vs NOS2 KO DEA-NO). Immunoblot detection of MMP-9 from total protein lysates isolated from Caveolin-3 KO mice and Caveolin-3 KO mice treated with saline or DEA-NO, 48 hours after IR. (F) Infarct size of WT, NOS2, and Caveolin-3 KO hearts 48 hours after IR, and previously fed with 50 mg/kg doxycycline for 1 week (n = 9 mice/group; mean \u00b1 SD; *p <0.05 NOS2 KO vs NOS2 KO + DOX. To further investigate the contribution of Caveolin-3 on EMMPRIN glycosylation, and the downstream EMMPRIN-mediated MMP activation, we found that IR induced the levels of MMP-9 in Caveolin-3 KO mice, and exogenous administration of DEA-NO had no significant effect ( In the current work we show new evidence about the molecular mechanism of NO in cardiac protection in response to IR. Our data support the hypothesis that NO protects the heart against IR by preventing ECM degradation. In resting conditions, we show for the first time that low glycosylated EMMPRIN is bound to Caveolin-3 in WT and NOS2 KO mice, while the complex was significantly reduced 48 hours after IR in NOS2 KO mice. Exogenous administration of DEA-NO to NOS2 KO mice rescued in part the WT phenotype, improving [heart function, and reducing the infarct size and the expression of MMP-9 in response to IR, whereas the same treatment failed to show any effect in Caveolin-3 KO mice. The expression of EMMPRIN in response to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been described in monocytes/macrophages, in human cardiac myocytes and in animal models of IR [ Caveolin proteins play a major role in the pathophysiology of several cardiovascular diseases [ The activation of MMPs is regulated by HG-EMMPRIN self-aggregation, [ We previously described that NO induces transcriptional inhibition of EMMPRIN [ Further studies focused to define the molecular mechanisms by which NO stabilizes the complex Caveolin-3/LG-EMMPRIN in response to IR will be required to precisely understand the molecular signaling pathways triggered by NO in cardiac protection. To this regard, the S-Nitrosylation of EMMPRIN and/or Caveolin-3, should be explored, since S-Nitrosylation have been suggested to induce cardioprotection against IR by still unknown mechanisms [ We thank Dr. Maria Jose Garc\u00eda Miguel and F\u00e9lix Hap for their continuous help and support.", "The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of FEN on intestinal recovery and enterocyte turnover after intestinal IR injury in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four experimental groups: (1) sham rats underwent laparotomy, (2) sham-FEN rats underwent laparotomy and were treated with intraperitoneal (IP) FEN (20 mg/kg); (3) IR rats underwent occlusion of both the superior mesenteric artery and the portal vein for 30 min followed by 24 h of reperfusion, and (4) IR-FEN rats underwent IR and were treated with IP FEN immediately before abdominal closure. Intestinal structural changes, Park's injury score, enterocyte proliferation, and enterocyte apoptosis were determined 24 h following IR. Treatment with FEN resulted in a significant decrease in Park's injury score in jejunum (32 %) and ileum (33 %) compared to IR animals. IR-FEN rats also demonstrated a significant increase in mucosal weight in jejunum (23 %) and ileum (22 %), mucosal DNA (38 %) and protein (65 %) in jejunum, villus height in jejunum (17 %) and ileum (21 %), and crypt depth in ileum (14 %) compared to IR animals. IR-FEN rats also experienced significant proliferation rates as well as lower apoptotic indices in jejunum and ileum which was accompanied with higher Bcl-2 levels compared to IR animals. Treatment with fenofibrate prevents intestinal mucosal damage and stimulates intestinal epithelial cell turnover following intestinal IR in a rat model.", "In agreement with this idea, substantial evidence has shown that the type I IGF receptor (IGF-IR) and its primary ligand IGF-I are important for maintaining the survival of malignant cells of hematopoietic origin. In this review, we discuss current understanding of the role of IGF-IR signaling in cancer with a focus on the hematological neoplasms. We also address the emergence of IGF-IR as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of different types of cancer including plasma cell myeloma, leukemia, and lymphoma. The discovery of the Numerous studies have concluded that the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) and its primary ligand IGF-I play significant roles in the establishment and progression of tumors, primarily by inhibiting apoptosis and inducing cellular transformation [ To date, there are several potentially effective IGF-IR inhibitors that have been tested in preclinical studies as well as in clinical trials enrolling patients harboring aggressive forms of solid cancers and hematological malignancies. Importantly, these IGF-IR inhibitors are well tolerated with minimal toxic effects The IGF signaling system plays significant roles in both embryonic and postnatal development as well as having important functions in normal adult physiology. IR is expressed as two isoforms - IR-A and IR-B. IR-A has oncogenic potential, expressed predominantly in fetal tissues, and its expression declines during adulthood. IR-B is the physiologically expressed isoform in adult tissues. The IR-A or IR-B receptor makes one half of the hybrid receptors along with one half of the IGF-IR. Excluding IGF-IIR, these receptors possess tyrosine kinase activity. At the other hand, IGF-IIR (also known as mannose-6-phosphate [M6P] receptor) binds and removes circulating IGF-II to keep its free form at very low levels. IGF-IR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is structurally composed of two identical \u03b1 subunits and two identical \u03b2 subunits that are connected by disulfide bonds to form the functional homodimeric receptor complex (Figure IGF-IR is a transmembranous homodimeric receptor tyrosine kinase that is composed of two identical extracellular \u03b1 subunits and two identical transmembranous \u03b2 subunits connected by disulfide bonds. The cytoplasmic regions of the \u03b2 subunits contain residues directly involved in IGF-IR signaling. Y950 is the binding site for its primary substrates including IRS-1 and SHC; Lys1003 is the ATP binding domain; and Tyr1131, Tyr1135, and Tyr1136 make up the activation loop of the kinase domain, which is followed by the C-terminus domain. The C-terminus domain of IGF-IR contains several tyrosine and serine residues. These residues are phosphorylated, probably to induce mitogenic effects, but how their phosphorylation actually contributes to normal and malignant IGF-IR signaling is still not fully understood. The binding of IGF-IR to its ligands causes the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues located in the intracellular portion of its \u03b2 subunit. Once phosphorylated, tyrosine 950 provides a docking site for IGF-IR substrates including IRS-1-4 and SHC proteins, which, in turn, act as docking sites. Upon substrate binding and phosphorylation of docking sites, downstream signaling is activated through the PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and STAT pathways and may stimulate cancer cell growth in an autocrine/paracrine manner [ Binding of IGF-IR to its primary ligand, IGF-I, causes the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues present in the intracellular portion of its \u03b2 subunit. Once phosphorylated, Y950 provides a docking site for its substrates IRS-1-4 and SHC proteins. Upon substrate binding, downstream signaling is activated through the IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/mTOR or SHC/RAS/MAPK pathway, leading to proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects, which culminate to oncogenesis and tumor cell survival. Mouse models have revealed the importance of IGF-IR in prenatal and postnatal growth, especially in regards to genetic imprinting. The activation of IGF-IR during these stages improves the survival and increases the proliferation of mitosis-competent cells, resulting in the growth of tissues such as skin, bone, adipose tissue, and skeletal and cardiac muscles [ The aberrant activation of the IGF-IR pathway is also strongly associated with initiating cancer growth [ Moreover, it has been documented that IGF-IR expression above a certain threshold can induce tumor cell progression that is independent of exogenous ligand stimulation. For example, when RM11A murine breast cancer cells that express high levels of exogenous IGF-IR were treated with IGF-I or IGF-II, the proliferative/survival potential of these cells was not enhanced, suggesting a ligand-independent mechanism [ It has also been shown that the level of IGF-IR expression, specifically a minimum number of its molecule, plays a key role in its transforming and oncogenic properties [ Studies on IGF system in normal epithelial and cancerous cells such as those of the breast have found that IGF-IR is activated in one of two ways through IGF-I: (1) hepatic production of IGF-I can increase serum IGF-I, which in turn may act in an autocrine manner as a stimulatory molecule to induce the proliferation of normal as well as cancer cells; and/or (2) local production of IGF-I by stromal cells that surround the tumorigenic cells serves as a paracrine stimulator of the IGF-IR signaling [ In contrast to the widely studied solid tumors, not many studies have examined the role of IGF-IR in hematological neoplasms, and most of these studies focused on plasma cell myeloma [ Also, there are studies showing the involvement of IGF-IIR in cancer development and progression. IGF-IIR, known as the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor, acts as a reservoir to clear IGF-II from the extracellular environment and cell surface through endocytosis and lysosomal degradation, thereby inhibiting IGF-II-induced tumor growth signaling [ IGF-I is a single-chain peptide that shares 62% and 40% amino acid sequence identities with IGF-II and proinsulin, respectively [ IGF-I is a ~7.6 kDa 70 amino acid single chain polypeptide that functions as the primary ligand for IGF-IR. There is increasing evidence that IGF-I might provide a major link between IGF-IR and the development of cancer through its regulatory effects on cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Although cancer cells do not necessarily secrete IGF-I, high concentrations of circulating IGF-I, which is secreted by the liver, have been found to associate increased cancer risk in children and adults as well as to contribute to the growth, maintenance, and progression of cancer [ IGF-II is a ~7.5 kDa 67 amino acid single chain mitogenic polypeptide that is produced mainly by the liver [ Plasma cell myeloma (PCM) accounts for approximately 10% of hematological malignancies with an incidence of four cases per 100,000 people a year [ In addition to IL-6, it has also been shown that IGF-I induces the growth and development of PCM through activation of IGF-IR. The effects of IGF-I were reversed when an anti-IGF-IR blocking antibody was additionally used [ IGF-I/IGF-IR axis supports the survival of PCM cells not only via signaling through IRS-1 but also by singling through IRS-2. The IRS-2/PI3K/p70S6K pathway was found to be either constitutively activated or instead activated via upstream interactions with IGF-I/IGF-IR [ In PCM, IGF-I/IGF-IR signaling inhibits apoptosis and induces tumor cell proliferation through the activation of two distinct pathways - PI3K/AKT and MAPK. For instance, IGF-IR suppresses apoptosis through inhibition of the release of cytochrome C from the mitochondria after the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. These processes prevent apoptosis from occurring in PCM cells [ One possible mechanism for the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in PCM is the lack of the PTEN tumor suppressor protein, a negative regulator of PI3K/AKT activity [ Whereas the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway by IGF-IR appears to be involved primarily with inhibition of apoptosis in PCM, activation of the MAPK pathway is believed to be principally involved with inducing cell proliferation [ In addition to the idea that distinct outcomes result from IGF-IR-induced activation of PI3K/AKT versus IGF-IR-induced activation of MAPK, more recent studies have revealed that \u201ccrosstalk\u201d exists between PI3K/AKT and MAPK and that this crosstalk is critical for PCM tumor progression [ In a similar fashion, it was shown that rapamycin-induced mTOR inhibition decreased the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which was associated with a compensatory IGF-I downstream signaling via the PI3K/AKT pathway [ In addition to the effects mediated by IGF-I, IGF-I/IGF-IR signaling is also involved in critical aspects of PCM dissemination, including adhesion, invasion, and migration. In this regard, IGF-I acts as a chemo-attractant for PCM cells that increases their adhesion to the extracellular matrix glycoprotein fibronectin [ It has also been shown that IGF-I triggers the polymerization of F-actin, induces phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin, and enhances \u03b2 Upregulation of IGF-I/IGF-IR signaling is prevalent in several types of leukemia, including AML, B-ALL, T-ALL, CML, and CLL. Overexpression of IGF-IR has been reported in human AML cells and autocrine IGF-I production has been suggested to play a role in drug resistance in AML [ In addition, in AML, it has also been shown that mTOR inhibition using rapamycin overactivates PI3K/AKT by upregulating IGF-I/IGF-IR signaling, in a fashion similar to that seen in PCM. These effects appear to occur through enhancing not only IRS-1 expression but also IRS-2 expression. Using 19 AML samples with constitutive PI3K/AKT activation, the rapamycin-derivative inhibitor everolimus increased AKT phosphorylation by upregulating the expression of IRS-2 via an IGF-I/IGF-IR autocrine loop [ The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) arise from clonal hematopoietic stem cells that are characterized by atypical morphology, aberrant maturation, and specific molecular events. Approximately, one third of MDS patients experience progression to AML [ Our group has discovered that IGF-IR also plays a role in CML [ In another recent study, the involvement of c-myb with IGF system in inducing the proliferation of CML cells was demonstrated [ The contribution of IGF-I/IGF-IR signaling to CLL has also been investigated. It was shown that IGF-I and IGF-IR participate in autocrine/paracrine loops to promote the survival of CLL cells [ Significant work has also been accompalished in T-ALL and B-ALL to study the effects of not only IGF-IR but also IGFs. For instance, one study reported the characteristics of insulin, IR, IGF-I, IGF-II, and GH binding in 18 established T-ALL and B-ALL cell lines [ Some studies have aimed at identifying potential causes of IGF-IR overexpression in ALL. At least two groups have identified deregulated microRNAs that contribute to IGF-IR overexpression in T-ALL. It was shown that Notch1 repressed the expression of microRNA-223, which, in turn, was able to decrease the expression IGF-IR protein. However, increased expression of microRNA-233 alone did not significantly hinder cell growth, alluding to the possibility that, in addition to the decrease in IGF-IR expression, modifications of other survival molecules are probably required to fully suppress T-ALL [ Evidence based on This category encompasses a relatively uncommon group of hematological neoplasms that have specific clinicopathological and molecular characteristics. The role of IGF/IGF-IR signaling in MPN has been investigated in a limited number of studies, and most of these studies focused on PV. An earlier study showed that the early circulating erythroid progenitors collected from PV patients and maintained in serum-free medium possess remarkably enhanced sensitivity to IGF-I, much more pronounced than the sensitivity of control progenitor cells from healthy subjects, attesting to probable contribution of IGF-I/IGF-IR signaling to PV pathogenesis. Notably, the sensitivity of the cells from PV patients to IGF-I substantially exceeded their sensitivity to erythropoietin [ Arsenite-inducible RNA-associated protein-like (AIRAPL) is an evolutionary conserved regulator of cellular proteostasis in nematodes. A recent study demonstrated that AIRAPL-deficient mice develop a fully penetrant MPN-like disease [ The potential contribution of IGF-IR to the pathogenesis of the different subtypes of malignant lymphoma has not been sufficiently investigated. Some studies, however, have shown that IGF-IR is over-expressed in some types of lymphoma cells [ Furthermore, in our lab, we used NPM-ALK We have been using NPM-ALK To a lesser extent, a role of GH in regulating IGF-IR expression has been demonstrated in mouse T-cell EL4 lymphoma cells. It was shown that one of the consequences of overexpression of endogenous GH was an increase in the expression of IGF-I and IGF-IR, which mediated the protection of these lymphoma cells from apoptosis. The EL4 lymphoma model may demonstrate a potential method of upregulation of IGF-IR via GH [ Our group has also demonstrated overexpression of IGF-IR in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines and human lymphoma tissues [ In Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), a recent study demonstrated that IGF-IR was overexpressed in 55% of the patients, and pIGF-IR was detectable in only 3 of the 16 IGF-IR-positive tumors that were analyzed for pIGF-IR expression [ Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) occurs in adults, and the standard chemotherapy treatment results in improvement in 60-70% of patients. At least two IGF-IR inhibitors have been shown to efficiently induce cellular death in DLBCL One of the reasons why IGF-IR was initially considered a poor choice therapeutic option was the fact that it shares a high percentage of amino acid sequence identity with IR. However, more recently, there have been several approaches to target IGF-IR more specifically. Strategies to inhibit IGF-IR signaling in human cancers include: (1) monoclonal antibodies that directly block IGF-IR; (2) monoclonal antibodies that function by neutralizing the circulating ligands IGF-I or IGF-II, which prevents IGF-IR from being activated; and (3) small molecule inhibitors that antagonize the kinase activity of IGF-IR [ An example of the anti-IGF-IR blocking antibodies is AVE1642, which had encouraging effects The IGF-IR small molecule inhibitors compete for the binding site for ATP within the IGF-IR kinase domain. For example, in Even when IGF-IR inhibitors were tolerated, significant number of patients did not exhibit improved outcomes. While further evaluations are required to characterize the mechanisms behind the shortcomings of these inhibitors, several studies underscored that an adequate number of IGF-IR receptors per cell or high levels of expression of IGF-IR protein or mRNA is required to achieve a robust response to the inhibitors [ One of the widely studied mechanisms for cancer cell resistance to IGF-IR inhibition is the upregulation of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. It was shown that inhibition of IGF-IR induces activation of AKTmTOR, resulting in a feedback synthesis and activation of AKT as well as of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family and survivin. These proteins possess pronounced ability to overcome the effects of IGF-IR inhibitors and cause survival of the resistant cells [ Several resistance mechanisms to IGF-IR inhibitors have been reported using The IGF-IR-related drug resistance in cancer does not only result from the utilization of IGF-IR inhibitors. In fact, IGF-IR signaling, by itself, can elicit substantial resistance to other cancer therapeutic modalities including chemotherapy and radiotherapy [ Analyzing carefully the different routes of IGF-IR-induced drug resistance can possibly shed some light on how to intervene with novel therapeutics to overcome this setback. It is important to note that the mechanisms by which resistance to IGF-IR inhibitors evolve are largely similar to the mechanisms induced by IGF-IR against other therapeutic modalities. Therefore, it is not surprising that preclinical studies and clinical trials where combined targeting of IGF-IR and other survival promoting proteins that reciprocally interact with IGF-IR to cause drug resistance provided promising results implicating that such an approach could be more beneficial than using one agent alone [ In spite of the breakthroughs that have occurred in treating patients with hematological malignancies, important gaps in knowledge still exist in understanding the pathobiology of these aggressive neoplasms. Although a relatively fewer studies have analyzed the role of IGF-IR in hematological neoplasms than in solid cancers, strong evidence suggests that this oncogenic receptor may become a useful target, alone or in combination, for treating hematological neoplasms. Several Although early evidence at least from some clinical trials suggested that targeting IGF-IR could represent a promising approach to treating cancer patients, the outcomes of these trials have not been as conclusive as the We are grateful to Dawn Chalaire for outstanding assistance with the preparation of this paper, and to Jordan Pietz for exceptional help with the preparation of the figures.", "It was proposed that these DSBs are repaired by the mechanism known as break-induced replication (BIR) through strand invasion into a homologous dsDNA followed by replication to the chromosome end. Because BIR results in an extensive loss of heterozygosity, it thought that this mechanism is suppressed when DSBs can be repaired by other more conservative HR mechanisms [ Rad52 ( Given an important role of Rad52 in yeast, it came as a surprise that Rad52 knockout mouse showed nearly normal DNA repair and HR phenotype [ Despite extensive genetic and biochemical studies, the exact function(s) of Rad52 remains to be elucidated.", "The increased use of IR in medical procedures has doubled the annual radiation dose and may increase cancer risk. Genomic instability is an intermediate lesion in IR-induced cancer. In contrast, PE treated mice with and without IR exposure displayed higher hepatic GSH concentrations than controls. Informed by the facts that oral ingestion of PJ and/or PE leads to limited absorption and rapid biotransformation of pomegranate polyphenols into phase II metabolites that are poor antioxidants, we hypothesized that if PE mitigates IR-induced genotoxicity, this would be due to the induction of endogenous defense mechanisms such as DNA repair and/or antioxidant responses rather than direct scavenging of IR-generated ROS. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by the To determine whether PE intake protects against systemic genotoxicity induced by IR we determined DSBs in peripheral blood leukocytes by measuring \u03b3-H2AX foci formation. Presence of micronuclei in peripheral blood erythrocytes reflect chromosomal damage that occurred during erythroblast development in bone marrow ( To examine whether PE prevented IR-induced genomic instability via upregulation of DNA repair we examined the effect of PE on expression of DSB repair genes. DSBs that occur during S and G2 phases can also be repaired by homologous recombination (HR) ( To determine whether PE protects against IR-induced genomic instability through the induction of antioxidant enzymes we examined the expression of genes that encode the major ROS metabolizing enzymes Gpx1, Cat, Sod1 and Sod2 and the oxidative-stress responsive enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). We found that expression of Gpx1, Cat and Sod2 was reduced in PE treated mice ( GSH is the most abundant non-enzymatic intracellular antioxidant ( This study demonstrated that PE consumption prevents IR-induced DNA and chromosomal damage, providing the first evidence that PE intake may protect against cancer development associated with IR exposure. Of particular interest is determination of the mechanisms by which PE ingestion provides protection against IR-induced genomic instability. It has been suggested that dietary polyphenols contribute to cancer prevention through upregulation of DNA repair ( Upregulation of antioxidant genes may serve as a cellular defense mechanism against IR-generated ROS and resultant genomic instability. These findings are compatible with the reported decreased activities of the same enzymes (GPX, CAT and SOD) in mice treated with PJ ( We postulated that modulation of intracellular GSH levels is a possible mechanism of action through which PE confers protection against IR-induced genome damage. GSH is the most abundant intracellular thiol that acts as a direct ROS scavenger and cofactor to antioxidant and detoxification enzymes ( In summary, our data demonstrate that PE intake protects against IR-induced genomic instability and thereby may provide a protection against IR-associated cancer.", "Lipid accumulation in the liver of HFD mice has been associated with H3K4 and H3K9 histone trimethylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1) and lipolysis-related genes [ Sirtuins (SIRTs) belong to the silent information regulator-2 family. SIRT1 deacetylation has been recognized as a regulatory mechanism for several proteins involved in NAFLD pathogenesis [ MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate gene expression via post-transcriptional mechanisms, regulating the main cellular processes, such as lipid metabolism, inflammation, apoptosis, cell growth and differentiation. Work on steatohepatitis in Marra\u2019s laboratory is supported by grants from the Italian Ministry for Research (Projects PRIN and FIRB), the European Community (projects FLIP and EPoS), and the CARIPLO Foundation.", "Drug treatments were removed 17 h post-IR. ATM kinase activation following low doses of IR requires the MRE11A, RAD50 and NBN complex [ ATR activation requires ATRIP and TOPBP1 [ At least 15 gene products constitute the FA pathway that resolves ICLs encountered by DNA replication forks. Cells were prepared in suspension and treated with KU60019 and increasing doses of IR. Drug treatments were removed 17 h post-IR.", "Radiation sensitization is an attractive approach because it has the potential to either improve the potency of existing therapies, or to reduce the amount of IR required. Importantly, to improve the therapeutic index tumor-targeted or tumor-selective IR-sensitization is required, to spare healthy tissues from similar IR-sensitization ( Radiation therapy primarily causes DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), which are considered to be the most lethal lesion ( The chemical synthesis of long, 2\u2019-modified RNA aptamers can be costly and are generally limited to a maximum product length of 50-60 nucleotides ( Aptamers were purchased from IDT Technologies (Leuven, Belgium) and RNA oligonucleotides from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The A10-3-DNAPK-siRNA chimera was generated through a three-part chemical synthesis and annealing process ( Chemically synthesized and annealed aptamer-siRNA chimera were evaluated for the ability to knock-down DNA-PK and to sensitize PSMA expressing cells to IR. The therapeutic effect of IR was significantly greater in A10-3-DNAPK treated PSMA-positive LNCaP tumors when compared to irradiated animals treated with control chimera ( Efficient delivery and cellular internalization has been a challenge for RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics. Over the last decade aptamers have evolved as promising RNAi delivery vehicles, capable of binding a variety of specific cell-surface ligands and shuttling associated RNAi agents into cells ( There are several strategies for generating aptamer-siRNA chimera including the continuous In summary, these data support that the pre-treatment of animals bearing PSMA-positive tumors with chemically synthesized and systemically administered aptamer-siRNA chimeras (two days prior to IR therapy) can significantly enhance tumor IR responses. The experimental design intentionally applied a single non-ablative IR treatment, so that additional therapeutic efficacy from IR-sensitization could be observed. Nonetheless we have observed one animal, treated with A10-3-DNAPK and 6 Gy IR, to have complete tumor ablation for more than three months after the termination of therapy. We anticipate that higher or longer IR doses would have resulted in more long-term tumor responses. Fractionated IR doses may also benefit if longer term gene knock-down is achieved, such as those reported in aptamer-siRNA chimera protective models of HIV transmission ( RNA aptamers are a unique class of targeting agents that have potential for clinical translation. On day 0, tumors were either untreated or irradiated (0 or 6 Gy IR).", "Significance was determined at A full scan GC/MS analysis demonstrated approximately 17.3% of tocotrienols, 25.3% of tocopherols, and 31.2% of squalene ( In order to determine the IC We then investigated whether TRFRB can protect the various cells types from different tissue origins against H We and others have previously shown that IR induced oxidative stress significantly and adversely affects mitochondrial electron transport chain and respiration [ Next we extended our findings into a different cell type and different cellular injury. Since therapeutic irradiation can result in significant skin injury, we focused on two different skin cell types to determine whether TRFRB can protect human skin cells from IR induced stress. First primary human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cells were irradiated at different doses and 24 h following IR the cells were collected to measure glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) levels. Both 4 and 8 Gy IR significantly increased the percentage of GSSG over total GSH suggesting an increase in oxidative stress in HDFs at these two IR doses. HaCaT cells were pretreated with DMSO vehicle or 5 In our next set of experiments we wanted to determine whether TRFRB could protect the skin cells from IR induced injury even if TRFRB is given after IR exposure. When HaCaT cells were irradiated with 8 Gy IR, received DMSO, 5 There is a significant and unmet need for the development of alternative strategies and novel agents to alleviate radiation side effects. The only approved radioprotective agent amifostine has limited use due to its side effects [ Here we provide evidence that a tocotrienol-rich fraction of rice bran oil deodorizer distillate, TRFRB, shows efficacy against peroxide and ionizing radiation induced injury Various cultured cell models were also utilized to explore which attributes of TRFRB were required for protection against H More importantly migration rates of keratinocytes were significantly improved by DT3 or TRFRB treatment even though they received TRFRB 4 h after exposure to IR. Additional DT3 or TRFRB treatment of these cells at 36 h following radiation exposure probably fortified and protected the keratinocytes from IR induced late ROS effects. This is significant since keratinocyte migration is a crucial component of wound healing, which is known to be perturbed when skin is exposed to IR [ Our mitochondrial function and cellular respiration studies also revealed significant effects of TRFRB on cells with or without any cellular stress. (a) Squalene, (b) Comparative antioxidant activity of pure Pretreatment with 5 Pretreatment with 5 (a) Oxidized glutathione levels in dermal fibroblasts were increased at 72 h when the cells were exposed to 4 or 8 Gy IR. This increase was prevented when cells received 5 The degree of mitochondrial uncoupling of HaCaT cells was significantly increased at 48 h when exposed to 8 Gy IR and this increase was reversed in the presence of 5 When HaCaT cells were irradiated with 8 Gy IR, received DT3 or TRFRB 4 h after irradiation, and plated for clonogenic cell survival 72 h following IR, there was an increase in cell survival in TRFRB treated cells. However, this increased survival fraction was not statistically significant compared to 8 Gy IR alone group. Each data point represents mean \u00b1 SD of Migration rates of HaCaT cells were decreased when the cells were exposed to 8 Gy IR.", "IR treatment specifically triggered PALB2 phosphorylation at Ser-157 and Ser-376 in manners that required the master DNA damage response kinase Ataxia telangiectasia mutated, revealing potential mechanistic links between PALB2 and the Ataxia telangiectasia mutated-dependent DNA damage responses.", "To investigate whether IR enhances the infiltration of bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMDMs) into tumors, the infiltration of BMDMs from GFP-transgenic mice in a murine prostate adenocarcinoma TRAMP-C1 model was examined by fluorescence microscopy. IR did not increase the number of BMDMs that infiltrated initially, but did increase monocyte retention within IR-treated tumors for up to 2 weeks. When BMDMs were differentiated in IR-treated tumor-conditioned medium (IR-CM) All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files. IR-T-CM: 70 Gy-irradiated TRAMP-C1 condition medium. IR-T-CM: BMDMs were pre-conditioned in irradiated T-CM for 24 hr and then examined for their migration toward T-CM. IR-A-CM*: BMDMs were pre-conditioned in irradiated T-CM for 24 hr and then examined for their migration toward A-CM. The percentage of each surface marker did not differ significantly between the control BMDMs and those pre-conditioned in IR-T-CM ( (A) The percentage of BMDM cells containing CD45, CD11b, CD68, F4/80, or CD206 surface antigens was examined by flow cytometry. IR-T-CM: Bone marrow-derived cells were differentiated in regular BMDM differentiation medium for 7 days and further cultured in irradiated TRAMP-C1 condition medium (IR-T-CM) for 24 hrs. (D) Comparison of the migration rate of BMDM pre-cultured in regular (CTRL) versus IR-T-CM (Pre-condition) for 24 hrs. IR: 25 Gy of radiation was given when tumor diameter is around 5 mm. Although a recent report by Choi The initial In the present study, IR did not affect initial BMDM infiltration, but irradiated tumors were able to consistently attract BMDMs for a longer period of time and into deeper tissues, than were control tumors, for up to approximately 1\u20132 weeks. IR-T-CM: BMDMs were pre-conditioned for 24 hr IR-T-CM.", "ApoB-lipoproteins were reported to promote IL-1\u03b2 secretion in immune cells; however, We examined 81 well-characterized normoglycemic men and postmenopausal women (\u2a7e27 kg m Plasma IL-1\u03b2 was near detection limit (0.071\u20130.216 pg ml Plasma apoB is associated with hyperinsulinemia and IR in normoglycemic obese subjects, which is eliminated upon adjustment for plasma IL-1Ra. One woman who was included in another genetic study at IRCM had a familial mutation that affects the metabolism of apoB-lipoproteins and was thus excluded from this analysis. All subjects signed an informed consent prior to initiation of the study, which was approved by the Ethics Board of Montreal Clinical Research Institute (IRCM). Sex differences in Fasting baseline characteristics and indices of insulin sensitivity and secretion during the Botnia clamp of the 48 women and 33 men subjects are presented in A hyperbolic relationship existed between insulin sensitivity and secretion when measured using two separate tests, and whether insulin ( As hypothesized, plasma apoB correlated with plasma IL-1Ra ( Finally, given the hyperbolic relation between insulin sensitivity and secretion, we tested whether the association of apoB to glucose-induced insulin secretion was dependent on its association with IR. Adjusting for insulin sensitivity (Log To test whether the relation of plasma apoB to hyperinsulinemia and IR was dependent on the IL-1 family, we first examined whether plasma IL-1\u03b2 and its receptor antagonist were related to hyperinsulinemia and IR during the Botnia clamp in an obese population, which to our knowledge has never been reported. Plasma IL-1\u03b2 correlated with total and second-phase insulin secretion ( White adipose tissue is a source of IL-1Ra, and plasma IL-1Ra is elevated in obesity, We examined whether the relation of plasma apoB to hyperinsulinemia and IR was dependent on the IL-1 family by two methods. First, in a partial correlation analysis, adjusting for plasma IL-1Ra eliminated the association of plasma apoB with all indices of insulin secretion and sensitivity ( Although no differences existed in any index of adiposity or body fat distribution, subjects with hyperapoB had higher indices of insulin secretion (fasting and total C-peptide secretion), IR (lower GIR and M/I) and elevated plasma IL-1Ra ( Here we present in a population of 81 overweight and obese yet normoglycemic subjects that (1) independent of sex, obesity and body composition, plasma apoB was positively associated with hyperinsulinemia, IR and plasma IL-1Ra and (2) the association of plasma apoB to hyperinsulinemia and IR was eliminated when adjusted for plasma IL-1Ra suggesting the involvement of an activated IL-1 family. In the first step, normal glucose progresses to impaired glucose tolerance, with IR driving higher insulin secretion. Third, men had higher IR and secretion than women. Similar sex differences in insulin sensitivity were observed by some studies using the hyperinsulinemia clamp Nevertheless, despite these sex differences, the association of plasma apoB with IR and hyperinsulinemia was independent of sex or body composition and may be related to the effects of apoB-lipoproteins Finally, adjusting the association of plasma apoB with IR and hyperinsulinemia for plasma IL-1Ra eliminated this association, suggesting the involvement of the IL-1 family IL-1\u03b2 is the end product of the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is implicated in the recognition of obesity-associated metabolic signals in macrophage and pancreatic cells. In conclusion, elevated plasma apoB associates with hyperinsulinemia and IR independent of adiposity in normoglycemic overweight and obese subjects. Plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide and glucose infusion rates (GIR) during the IVGTT in women ( Hyperbolic relation (one phase decay) of insulin sensitivity with total insulin secretion ( Correlation of plasma apoB with plasma IL-1\u03b2 ( Correlation of plasma IL-1\u03b2 with total ( Abbreviations: AUC, area under the curve; BMI, body mass index; DI, disposition index; HbA Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; HbA", "We used a novel high-throughput 92-protein assay to identify circulating biomarkers for HOMA of IR in two cohorts of community residents without diabetes ( Worldwide, diabetes affected over 387 million people and contributed to more than 4.9 million deaths in 2014. The prevalence of diabetes is projected to increase to 592 million by 2035 ( Recently, a new technology, the proximity extension assay ( In 1970, all male residents ( In 2001, the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study group invited an unselected sample of 70-year-old residents of Uppsala community (1,016 of 2,025 invited persons [50.2%] were enrolled; 50% female) primarily to validate measures of endothelial function ( The HOMA of IR index (HOMA-IR) was calculated according to the method proposed by Matthews et al. ( The Olink Proseek Multiplex CVD 96\u00d796 proximity extension assay ( For MR analyses, we used the nonweighted genetic IR score composed of 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) validated in up to 18,565 subjects by Scott et al. Preliminary models indicated nonnormal distribution of model residuals, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations and HOMA-IR were transformed to natural logarithmic scale to alleviate nonnormality. Separate linear regression models were assessed for each biomarker with lnHOMA-IR as the dependent variable and BMI, waist circumference, lnCRP, age, comorbidity, storage time, and sex as independent variables. Comorbidity was dummy coded based on a Charlson Comorbidity Index ( Thereafter, we assessed biomarkers related to IR for associations with 10-year incident T2D using Cox regression in ULSAM and PIVUS combined, with adjustment for BMI, waist, lnCRP, age, comorbidity, storage time, cohort, and sex. To assess predictive performance of biomarkers for 10-year T2D risk, we randomly split the combined cohorts of participants with sufficient data into a two-thirds learning ( Mendelian randomization techniques based on IV analysis were used to assess potential causal associations between biomarkers and IR in both directions ( We evaluated the association of the genetic IR score with lnHOMA-IR using the summary statistics for 46,186 individuals without diabetes in the MAGIC cohort based on the method described by Dastani et al. ( We assessed the association of each biomarker IV with lnHOMA-IR in the MAGIC cohort ( Baseline cohort characteristics of participants without diabetes in PIVUS-70 and ULSAM-77 Data are mean \u00b1 SD or Assessed in either arm at rest using the routine sphygmomanometer technique. Linear regression analysis results for biomarker associations with lnHOMA-IR, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, waist circumference, lnCRP, comorbidity, and storage time \u03b2-Coefficients (95% CI) express the change in lnHOMA-IR associated with an SD-unit increase in NPX value. In adjusted logistic regression analysis, increased concentrations of In LASSO Cox regression based on the learning sample, 10-year diabetes risk was predicted by a model that included the FORS score and the two biomarkers associated with T2D ( In a literature search, we identified suitable IVs for IL-1ra (rs4251961 and rs6759676) ( We found evidence of a causal effect of HOMA-IR on For the causal effect of biomarker on HOMA-IR, we identified suitable genetic IVs for IL-1ra, In two prospective community samples of 1,367 elderly individuals without diabetes, we identified seven proteins positively associated with prevalent IR, and one of these, cathepsin D, has not previously been reported as associated with IR. These correlations either could be explained by biomarkers being implicated in the same biological pathways or could represent different biological cascades related to IR and cardiovascular risk. We therefore carried all seven biomarkers forward for further analysis, where we found evidence for a causal effect of IR on MR analysis offers a statistical approach to inferring causality in observational studies. In MR analysis, a genetic variant or combination of variants known to be associated with an intermediate phenotype is used as the IV to assess the possible causal effect of the intermediate on the outcome variable ( Using MR analysis, we found evidence for a positive causal effect of IR on Our study confirmed previous reports ( For six of the identified protein markers, we confirm previously reported associations with IR in humans ( The lysosomal endopeptidase cathepsin D is expressed ubiquitously, and its main effects include intracellular protein turnover and extracellular matrix breakdown. In a retrospective analysis unadjusted for baseline glucose levels, IL-1ra was elevated up to 13 years prior to T2D diagnosis ( The addition of IR biomarkers to the FORS score did not improve prediction. The observed associations with IR support the prospective validation of the assay for translating targeted proteomics into the diabetes care practice, but no direct clinical implications in the short term should arise from our findings. However, the identification of cathepsin D as an IR risk protein in this proteomics study in large community samples suggests potential benefits of applying this technology to biomarker discovery in the clinical setting and for other pathologies. A fasting blood sample\u2013based proxy measure (HOMA-IR) was used in this study, which does not provide a perfect reflection of the physiology of IR. While we attempted to reduce bias in MR modeling by, e.g., sensitivity analysis for pleiotropy of the genetic IR score, our findings are limited by the lack of statistical power for the IR-biomarker section. We found evidence of a causal effect of IR on This article contains Supplementary Data online at", "However, few studies have investigated circulating adipokines and IR in subjects with combined metabolic syndrome X (MetX) and CSX. Circulating adipokines and degree of IR were measured. Subjects with combined MetX and CSX had a significantly higher HOMA-IR, a higher circulating leptin level (median 8.7 vs. 3.3 ng/mL, p < 0.001), but a lower circulating adiponectin level (median 2.8 vs. 12.3 \u03bcg/mL, p < 0.001) than those without MetX and CSX. In pairwise comparisons, combined MetX and CSX subjects had a similar circulating adipokines and IR index as those who had only either one syndrome X. Combined MetX and CSX had a significantly higher HOMA-IR, a higher circulating leptin but a lower circulating adiponectin level than those without MetX and CSX. In one study, hyper-insulinemia during oral glucose tolerance test was more prominent in the CSX group than in controls, which implies that IR might contribute to the micro-vascular angina [ Several clinical studies have found decreased circulating adiponectin level in populations with hypertension, obesity, MetX, type 2 DM, and coronary artery disease (CAD) [ To date, few studies have investigated circulating adipokines and IR in subjects with double syndrome X that is, combined MetX and CSX, or either syndrome X alone.

Combined syndrome X did not confer more changes on adipokines or IR index comparing with those with only one syndrome X. Serum triglycerides and hypertension were independently associated with the diagnosis of combined MetX and CSX in subjects who underwent CAG but without stenosis. The most common observation was the presence of IR in both of these syndromes [ There have been very few reports about the circulating adipokines in combined MetX and CSX subjects. According to the data of circulating adiponectin of CSX, MetX, and the controls from the publications [ In conclusion, subjects with combined MetX and CSX had a significantly higher HOMA-IR, a higher circulating leptin, but a lower circulating adiponectin level than those without MetX and CSX. Combined MetX and CSX did not confer more changes on adipokines or IR index comparing with those with only one syndrome X. Serum triglycerides and hypertension were independently associated with the diagnosis of combined MetX and CSX among subjects who underwent CAG but without stenosis.", "Based on the mechanism underlying postoperative IR, preoperative carbohydrate loading can inhibit only the exacerbating peripheral IR caused by excessive circulating concentrations of free fatty acids secondary to starvation but not the peripheral and central IR induced by stress hormones and inflammatory cytokines released as part of the surgical stress response, suggesting that preoperative carbohydrate loading may have only limited benefit. Because preoperative carbohydrate loading has only limited benefit both theoretically and clinically, we should complement its effect through the introduction of a less-invasive approach capable of attenuating surgical stress-mediated IR.", "Intestinal IR induced elevation of TNF-\u03b1 level in the diaphragm.", "As unrepaired DSBs are the most cytotoxic DNA lesion, defining the downstream cellular responses to DSBs are critical for understanding the mechanisms of tumor cell responses to IR. The effects of experimental IR on HNSCC cells beyond DNA damage Head and neck cancers are typically squamous cell carcinomas that present in the larynx, pharynx, salivary glands, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, or oral cavity. Although the mechanism of DNA repair in response to IR damage has been extensively studied, the effect of IR on physical parameters of tumor cell bodies and subcellular components is ill-defined. This study aimed to investigate the physical and biochemical effects of X-ray IR on the HNSCC cell line, UM-SCC-22A, through the use of label-free, quantitative phase microscopy in conjunction with fluorescence microscopy. After permeabilization, the projected dry mass density maps revealed that the mass density area per cell appeared significantly less compared with non-permeabilized cells ( Analysis of DIC z-stack images and subsequent binary images of fixed, fixed and permeabilized, and fixed, permeabilized, and stained UM-SCC-22A cell monolayers allowed for enhanced visualization of nuclear architecture that is regularly obscured by cytoplasmic constituents ( To investigate the physical effects of IR on UM-SCC-22A cancer cells, the fluorescence intensity of \u03b3-H2AX foci and the physical parameters of cell constituents were quantified following IR exposure. Consistent with what has been previously reported, following 8 Gy of IR, the expression of \u03b3-H2AX foci in UM-SCC-22A cells visually increased, while DAPI staining of nuclear DNA revealed condensed chromatin structure ( Following UM-SCC-22A cell exposure to 8 Gy of IR, the dry mass probability density histograms of the cytoplasm, nuclei, and \u03b3-H2AX foci were significantly broader ( This study describes the effect of X-ray IR on the biophysical parameters of the HNSCC cell line derived from a primary site, UM-SCC-22A, through the use of fluorescence microscopy in conjunction with label-free quantitative microscopy techniques. The observed increase in mass following IR exposure may also be related to the accumulation and function of tumor suppressor protein p53, which is the main regulator of the cell DNA damage response.

One of the most potent stimuli for eliciting tolerance to IR injury is exercise (Quindry and Hamilton, 2007[ HIIT is characterized by repeated bouts of high-intensity exercise interspersed by periods of rest or low-intensity exercise for recovery (Gibala and Jones, 2013[ Doubtlessly, EICP vanishes after the termination of exercise training (Lennon et al., 2004[ The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether short-term HIIT could reduce the incidence of ischemic-induced arrhythmias and infarct size; and if so, how long this protective effect is retained after exercise cessation. Animals in the sedentary group were divided into sham (Sham) and control ischemic rats (CO-IR group). Exercised rats were randomly divided into the following sub-groups: a) Ex + IR injury performed after 1 day of rest (Ex-IR1), b) Ex + IR injury performed after 7 days of rest (Ex-IR7), and c) Ex + IR injury performed after 14 days of rest (Ex-IR14). After 1 day of rest, the animals performed 5 consecutive days of treadmill HIIT exercise: 5 min warm up with 50 % VO Coronary artery ligation and release were performed according to our previous study (Shekarforoush and Foadoddini, 2012[ After IR procedure, the LAD was reoccluded and Evans blue dye (1 ml, 2 %) was injected through right atrium to identify the non-perfused area, as area at risk (AAR). The hemodynamic data of this study are summarized in Table 1 There are significant differences in body weight (p = 0.007) and heart weight (p < 0.001) among groups, but no difference existed in heart- to body weight ratio (p = 0.25) in experimental groups (Table 2 The effects of HIIT on post-exercise infarct size at each time point are presented in Figure 2 The results of HIIT on ischemia-induced arrhythmias are shown in Figure 3 As seen in Figure 4 As seen in Figure 5 Reduction of myocardial damage during IR injury can be accounted as a major importance in decreasing the mortality and morbidity of coronary heart disease (Michelsen et al., 2012[ The effects of exercise intensity in providing cardioprotection in an ischemic insult showed that exercise training at an intensity of 55-60 % VO Our results show that short-term training did not prevent IR-induced arrhythmias which are in agreement to findings of Quindry et al.

In addition, hyperthyroidism significantly increased basal NO Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a major cause of mortality worldwide [ The myocardial response to IR injury can be moderated via various interventions such as ischemic postconditioning (IPost) [ Patients with overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [ Nitric oxide (NO) is produced by NO synthase enzymes and plays an essential role in cardiac functioning. Increased NO production following myocardial ischemia leads to IR injury. Conditions that escalate both NO and oxidative stress production also contribute to IR injury [ Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate effect of IPost against IR injury in an In this study, 56 male Wistar rats (2-month old) were provided from laboratory animal house of the Research Institute for Endocrine Sciences (RIES), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. For IR experiments, the control and hyperthyroid animals were randomly divided into 7 subgroups (n=8 each): Control (C), control-IR (C-IR), control-postconditioning (C-IPost), hyperthyroidism (HP), hyperthyroidism-IR (HP-IR), hyperthyroidism- postconditioning (HP-IPost), and hyperthyroidism-postconditioning-aminoguanidine (HP-IPost-AG). LVDP, LVEDP, \u00b1dp/dt, IS and NO CS activity in soleus muscle and thyroid hormone levels (T Preischemic hemodynamic values were significantly lower in the hyperthyroid groups than controls ( Post-ischemic \u00b1dp/dt and LVDP decreased significantly in the HP-IR group, compared with the C-IR group following ischemia (30 min) and reperfusion (120 min). Following IR, post-ischemic \u00b1dp/dt and LVDP increased significantly in the HP-IPost-AG group, compared to the HP-IPost group ( During the 30 minutes ischemia, hyperthyroid group showed a significant increase in LVEDP (contracture), compared to controls. IPost significantly reduced the LVEDP during reperfusion phase in the C-IPost group; in addition, IPost in combination with AG, significantly reduced the LVEDP during reperfusion phase in the HP-IPost-AG group compared to HP-IPost ( Heart and serum NO Our findings indicate that hyperthyroidism increase injury induced by IR in rat heart, which may be due to increasing of NO production. IPost provides protective effects against IR injury in control rats, but, has no effect in hyperthyroid rats. Heart hypertrophy increases both the soleus muscle CS activity, and also levels of serum thyroid hormones (T In our study, preischemic values of LVDP and \u00b1dp/dt were lower in the hyperthyroid rats; the hearts from hyperthyroid rats, exhibited a decreased recovery of LVDP and \u00b1dp/dt following IR indicating that these hearts are vulnerable to IR injury, findings consistent with previous studies [ In this study, pre-ischemic heart rate was higher in the hyperthyroid group than the controls; in this regard, studies have been shown that hyperthyroidism increseas the heart rate through various mechanisms, such as augmented L-type calcium channels [ In our study, IPost failed to offer any protection in hearts of hyperthyroid rats, unlike the hearts of control rats, in which it seems that IPost had a cardioprotective effect, via inhibiting mPTP (mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore). Similar to our results, it has been reported that cardioprotective effects of IPost in reducing IS abrogated in disease state including metabolic syndrome [ In the current study, hypertrophy occurred along with increasing of heart NO In this study, IPost, significantly diminished NO In conclusion, hyperthyroidism increased susceptibility of heart to IR injury and unlike control rats, IPost could not provide protection against this injury due to NO overproduction; cardioprotective effects of IPost in hyperthyroid rats are restored in presence of iNOS inhibition. ischemic postconditioning ischemiareperfusion left ventricular developed pressure nitric oxide ischemic heart disease coronary artery disease reactive oxygen species left ventricular end-diastolic pressure mitochondrial permeability transition pore Alterations of cardiac function during reperfusion; (A) Left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP); (B) Maximum increase in left ventricular pressure (+dp/dt); (C) Decrease in left ventricular pressure (-dp/dt); (D) Heart rate; control-ischemia reperfusion (C-IR), C-ischemic postconditioning (C-IPost), hyperthyroid-IR (HP-IR); hyperthyroid-IPost (HP-IPost), and hyperthyroid-IPost-aminoguanidine (HP-IPost-AG); data are mean\u00b1SE (n=8 rats); Alterations of LVEDP during IR; left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP); control-ischemia reperfusion (C-IR), C-ischemic postconditioning (C-IPost), hyperthyroid-IR (HP-IR); hyperthyroid-IPost (HP-IPost) and hyperthyroid-IPost-aminoguanidine (HP-IPost-AG); data are mean\u00b1SE (n=8 rats); The alterations of NOx in heart of control and hyperthyroid groups; control- ischemia reperfusion (C-IR); C-ischemic postconditioning (C-IPost); hyperthyroid-IR (HP-IR); hyperthyroid-IPost (HP-IPost), and hyperthyroid-IPost-aminoguanidine (HP-IPost-AG); data are as mean\u00b1SE (n=8 rats); The alterations of infarct size in heart of control and hyperthyroid groups. control- ischemia reperfusion (C-IR); C-ischemic postconditioning (C-IPost); hyperthyroid-IR (HP-IR); hyperthyroid-IPost (HP-IPost), and hyperthyroid-IPost-aminoguanidine (HP-IPost-AG); data are mean\u00b1SE; (n=6 rats) as present of total area; General Characteristics of animals in the hyperthyroid and control groups The data are presented as means\u00b1SEM.", "The results revealed that catalase treatment markedly inhibits IR-induced apoptosis in murine hematopoietic stem cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells. Mechanistically, catalase treatment attenuates IR-induced DNA double-strand breaks and inhibits reactive oxygen species. Unexpectedly, we found that the radioprotective effect of catalase is associated with activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway and pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 abolishes the protective activity of catalase, suggesting that catalase may protect HSPCs against IR-induced toxicity via promoting STAT3 activation. Collectively, these results demonstrate a previously unrecognized mechanism by which catalase inhibits IR-induced DNA damage and apoptosis in HSPCs.", "Identification of the essential oil constituents was accomplished relying on their retention indices on HP-5 column and by computerized matching of the acquired mass spectra with those recorded by Adams [ Leaves of The oil of air-dried and finely ground leaves of Saturated solution of CO Validation of the FT/ATR-IR method has been fulfilled by studying linearity, accuracy, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), precision, selectivity, and robustness. Eight different concentrations of Accuracy was evaluated by comparing the results of IR analysis with results of acid-base titration method carried out by titrating 10 mL of each solution prepared in linearity study against NaOH (0.01 N). Limit of detection (LOD) was considered as the least concentration below which IR was not able to differentiate between signal and noise and the response kept constant and independent of carbon dioxide concentration.

Thus, we elucidated the pathological molecular mechanism of IR-AS by feeding an HFC diet to Tibetan minipigs to induce IR and AS. HFC-fed minipigs exhibited IR through increased body weight, fasting blood glucose levels, plasma cholesterol and its composition, and insulin and free fatty acid (FFA) levels; decreased insulin sensitivity; impaired glucose tolerance; and hypertension. These data suggest that HFC-fed Tibetan minipigs develop IR and AS and that PPARs are involved in cardiovascular remodeling and impaired function. Based on an epidemiological study, the incidence of diabetes is rapidly increasing with the population aging, and approximately 9.7% of adults have diabetes in China [ IR has been implicated in AS promotion and impaired endothelial-dependent diastolic function [ Pigs are a potentially useful animal model because, unlike mice and rabbits, their anatomy, physiology, feeding and sleeping habits, neo-intimal formation, and thrombosis are very similar to those of humans. Pigs can recapitulate the formation of diabetes- and inflammation-induced AS lesions [ Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) belong to a superfamily of the type II nuclear hormone receptors, are ligand-activated transcription factors, which have three subtypes (PPAR \u03b1, \u03b2/\u03b4, and \u03b3), and may participate in lipid metabolism regulation and AS development [ Therefore, we hypothesized that IR-AS with spontaneous chronic ischemia in HFC-fed Tibetan minipig maybe associated with inflammation, IR, autonomic dysfunction, and activation of PPARs and the NF-\u0138B signaling pathway. In this work, we successfully recapitulated the IR-AS Tibetan minipig model induced by an HFC diet. We aimed to elucidate whether HFC-fed Tibetan minipig developed IR-AS and to understand the cause of cardiac impairment and pathological molecular mechanisms. Consequently, our results provide an experimental basis for the relationship between IR and cardiovascular diseases and drug treatment. A two-tailed Tibetan minipigs were fed an HFC diet for 24 weeks to induce IR-AS. HFC-fed minipigs had significantly increased body weight, body mass, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, FFA, FBG, insulin, and HOMA-IR index compared with Ctr minipigs ( Ctr: control group animals (n = 4); HFC: high-fat/cholesterol atherogenic diet animals (n = 6); HDL-C: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; HOMA-IR: homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. HFC-fed minipigs exhibited significantly reduced SDNN, total power (TP), and HF power at 8 weeks after experiment initiation compared with the Ctr group ( Oil Red O staining analysis demonstrated that aortic atherosclerotic lesions significantly increased in the HFC group compared with the Ctr group ( PPAR gene and protein expression levels in the abdominal aorta were assessed to confirm whether activated PPARs participate in an important pathological mechanism in the Tibetan minipig model of IR-AS. Compared with the Ctr group, HFC-fed minipigs had significantly higher levels of qPCR and western blotting showed that mRNA and protein levels, respectively, of PPAR-\u03b1 and PPAR-\u03b2/\u03b4 were significantly reduced in the heart tissue of HFC-fed minipigs ( NF-\u0138B protein levels increased in the HFC group compared with the Ctr group (Figure In the current study, we aimed to establish a Tibetan minipig model of IR-AS by feeding an HFC diet, which resulted in significant weight gain, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, hypertension, inflammation, and activated the PPARs and NF-\u0138B signaling pathways. These abnormalities are known to develop in IR and AS; thus, the Tibetan minipig model may be helpful to further understanding of human IR and cardiovascular disease development. Other investigators have induced IR in pig models by using high-energy diets enriched with cholesterol and fat, but IR reportedly develops at different times, e.g., 2 weeks [ Additionally, HFC-fed Tibetan minipigs had significantly increased plasma FFA concentration and blood pressure and depressed HRV with increased sympathetic activities. PPAR-\u03b1, PPAR-\u03b2/\u03b4, and PPAR-\u03b3 are the ligand-activated transcription factors that function as the master regulators of insulin sensitivity, glucose homeostasis, fatty acid and lipoprotein metabolism, inflammation, and AS [ Moreover, Our findings describe a novel minipig model where by feeding Tibetan minipigs an HFC diet produced IR-AS, including dyslipidemia, IR, glucose intolerance, hypertension, and inflammatory and vascular AS lesions. We propose that this Tibetan minipig model may be helpful to further understanding of human IR and cardiovascular disease development.", "More in detail, since the Microsoft Kinect sensor allows capturing IR data, IR active sticky markers have been used to identify the real joints in the human body. The validation experiment starts with the creation of a background depth frame ( depth frames, used as inputs to the proposed algorithm and to Algorithm 2; IR frames, used to recover the real joint positions identified by markers; skeleton frames, computed by Algorithm 1. In particular, It may happen that an IR marker used for validation gets hidden from the sensor at a given As a final remark, the computational requirements of the algorithm working at full depth frame resolution have been estimated, by evaluating the execution time of a MATLAB implementation running over 2800 depth frames.", "Protein expression of PTP-1B (a negative regulator of IR-IRS-1 signaling), PTEN (a negative regulator of Akt-mediated signaling), protein degradation and lactate release by muscle, and plasma lactate levels were increased by burn. IRS-1 plays a pivotal role in metabolic actions of insulin in skeletal muscle, while IRS-2 has a more prominent role than IRS-1 in liver metabolism [ Protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-1B downregulates insulin signaling by dephoshorylating tyrosine residues in IR and IRS-1 [ Protein farnesylation is a lipid modification of the cysteine residues in the CAAX motif located in the carboxyl terminus of proteins (\u201cC\u201d is cysteine, \u201cA\u201d is aliphatic amino acid, and \u201cX\u201d is any amino acid at the carboxyl terminus, but usually serine, methionine, glutamine, or alanine). The maximum effects of burn on FTase, PTP-1B and PTEN expression and plasma lactate levels were observed at 3 days after burn ( IR protein expression was not altered by burn, FTI-277 or insulin (B). Insulin-stimulated IR phosphorylation was attenuated at 3 days after burn compared with sham-burned mice, which was almost completely restored by FTI-277 treatment (C, D). Burn decreased IRS-1 protein expression (E) and insulin-stimulated IRS-1 phosphorylation (F, G), both of which were reversed by FTI-277. Insulin significantly increased p-IRS-1/GAPDH ratio and p-IRS-1/IRS-1 ratio in sham-burned mice and FTI-277-treated burned mice, whereas insulin failed to significantly increase p-IRS-1/GAPDH ratio or p-IRS-1/IRS-1 ratio in vehicle-treated burned mice (F, G). There was a trend of increase in insulin-stimulated p-IRS-1/IRS-1 ratio in vehicle-treated burned mice, but there was no statistical difference (G).", "To investigate the nature of this selective signaling, we have conducted a detailed investigation of XMetA to evaluate specific phosphorylation and activation of IR, Akt, and ERK in Chinese hamster ovary cell lines expressing either the short or long isoform of the human IR. These data indicate that the preferential signaling of XMetA is due to an innate difference in pathway sensitivity of Akt versus ERK responses to IR activation and partial agonism by XMetA, rather than a separate pathway-biased mechanism. The metabolic selectivity of partial IR agonists like XMetA, if recapitulated in vivo, may be a desirable feature of therapeutic agents designed to regulate blood glucose levels while minimizing undesirable outcomes of excessive IR mitogenic activation.", "An unusual property of IRR is to respond to mildly alkaline extracellular medium with pH above 7.9 . No peptide or protein has been found yet to activate IRR; it was therefore proposed that the hydroxyl anion represents the natural agonist of IRR . IRR differs substantially from IR and IGF-IR, not only by its pH-sensing property but also by its highly specific tissue distribution primarily in organs involved in acid/base production. tests with IRR knockout mice revealed the receptor's role in excessive base excretion by the kidneys , thus identifying IRR as a potential component in achieving acid-base homeostasis . With artificial IRR/IR chimeras, we have previously shown that the pH sensitivity of IRR is defined by its extracellular region , which, similarly to other members of the IR minifamily, contains two N-terminal leucine-rich repeat domains, named L1 and L2, joined by the cysteine-rich C domain, and three C-terminal fibronectin type-III repeats (FnIII-1, FnIII-2, and FnIII-3) . The analysis of IR/IRR chimeras with swapped domains revealed the importance of multiple domains for the pH-sensing property of IRR, with the L1 and C domains having the primary role . While IRR activation shows strong positive cooperativity, the mutants with decreased pH sensitivity exhibited either reduced or no activation cooperativity. In this study, we addressed the role of L2 and fibronectin domains in the IRR pH-dependent activation by mutating single residues and swapping similar IR and IRR domains. Our results indicate that these domains contribute to alkali sensing and suggest a two-site model of IRR pH-dependent activation. The chimeras of human IRR and IR with partial ectodomain or tyrosine kinase domain swapping were obtained by cloning using the PCR strategy as described in Ref. Lysates of transfected cells were directly analyzed by Western blotting with anti-pIR/IRR antibodies and signal quantitation with the Molecular Imager. The blots were further stripped and stained again with anti-IR/IRR C-end antibodies. The ratio of integral density of the phosphorylated receptor (pIR/IRR signal) to the total receptor (IR/IRR antibody signal) was plotted versus pH. HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding IRR or mutant chimeras with C-terminal 6xHis-tag essentially as described . Then eluates were blotted with anti-pIR/IRR antibodies. To normalize the data for the actual receptor protein amount, the blotting membranes, after staining with anti-pIR/IRR antibodies, were stripped with stripping solution (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) and reprobed with anti-IR/IRR antibodies (). The differences of normalized phosphosignals after alkaline and neutral pH-treatment for chimeras or mutants were compared with the same data for IRR-TK(N) construct, which was used as the 100% reference (). Rabbit anti-IR/IRR antibodies were raised against the IRR C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (aminoacid residues 961\u20131297) expressed in bacteria as GST-fusion protein. The anti-pIR/IRR antibodies were raised against KLH-coupled peptide CGMTRDVpYETDpYpYRKGGKGL from the activation loop of IRR as described . Our previous data on IR/IRR chimeras with swapped domains of the extracellular region indicated that not just one, but several of them contribute to the IRR pH-sensing property. We identified the primary center of IRR pH sensitivity within the L1C domains. Replacing either the IRR L1C domains (residues 1\u2013333) or L2 domain (residues 334\u2013462), or both domains, with the homologous fragments of IR reduced the receptor activity to 35, 64, and 7 percent, respectively. Within L1C domains, five amino acid residues (L135, G188, R244, and vicinal H318 and K319) were identified as IRR-specific and conserved in the evolution. Concurrent mutation of these five residues produced the same negative effect on IRR activity as the replacement of L1C domains. The pH dependence of cell-expressed L1C and L2 swapped constructs was shifted towards alkalinity and, in contrast to IRR, did not show positive cooperativity . These were identified by the multiple alignment of L2 domains of IR, IGF-IR, and IRR sequences from different species ( and A). We searched for the residues that were evolutionarily conserved in IRR but differed significantly from those of IR or IGF-IR, e.g. Five amino acid residues in the L2 domain of IRR were thus identified, namely M406 (v.s. L in IR and Q in IGF-IR), V407 (v.s. E in IR and L or M in IGF-IR), D408 (v.s. I or A in IR and E or P in IGF-IR), P436 (v.s. T or I in IR and R or H in IGF-IR) and V437 (v.s. Q or H in IR and S,A or E in IGF-IR). The alanine mutant constructs were made on the basis of IRR-TK(N) chimera (B and ), that contained a swapped N-terminal fragment of the catalytic tyrosine kinase domain from IR (from R1027 to M1103) into IRR to facilitate the autophosphorylation assay . This previously developed assay, described in detail in Material and methods, makes it possible to quantitatively analyze IRR activity. Constructs with single-point alanine mutation of three vicinal residues M406, V407 and D408 of IRR (named M406-TK(N), V407-TK(N) and D408-TK(N)) that were identified as leads by bioinformatics were produced (A,B). However, the construct with all three residues mutated to alanine MVD-TK(N) showed that activity decreased to 28 \u00b1 10% () as compared to the wild-type IRR (C). Based on the IR ectodomain crystal structure, which represents the lambda shape form with two receptor subunits as a head-to-tail complex with axial symmetry , we proposed a similar structure for the IRR ectodomain. To test the action of three fibronectin type-III repeats on IRR pH sensitivity, we made constructs by swapping either the FnIII-1 domain (residues 496\u2013637), both FnIII-2 and FnIII-3 domains (residues 638\u2013988), and also all FnIII domains, named Fn1-TK(N), Fn2&3-TK(N) or Fn-TK(N), with partial swapping of the catalytic tyrosine kinase domain from IR (A, ). To further investigate this phenomenon, we prepared similar constructs with the native intracellular region of IRR and analyzed their activity in the intact cell assay (A and ). Notably, the bands of Fn2&3-IRR or Fn-IRR constructs shifted from about 70 kDa in IRR to about 100 kDa in the chimeras, due to significant glycosylation of FnIII-2 and FnIII-3 domains of IR . Previous studies of IR demonstrated the critical role of the C-terminal 16 amino acid residues of the alpha subunit in spliced form IRb (C), named CT peptide, in insulin binding . To test if this region within the FnIII-2 and FnIII-3 domains is also important for IRR pH sensing, we made two constructs; one with additional swapping of the C-terminal part of the alpha subunit of IRR with CT peptide of IR, named Cpep-TK(N), and another with alanine substitutions of seven evolutionary conserved amino acid residues (P727, W728, K729, V730, T731, N734 and K735), in the region coded by exon 11 of IRR, named ex11_7A-TK(N) (A and C). Exon 11 is present only in isoform A of IR (long isoform), as well as in IRR sequence, but absent in IGF-IR . Cpep-TK(N) or ex11_7A-TK(N) showed the same activity as the full IRR ectodomain (B). To understand how mutations change IRR alkali sensing activity, we analyzed the pH dependence of the mutants that showed significant activity changes. In contrast to the results of the test, the chimeras for the whole-cell assay contained the intracellular region of IRR. Two mutants, PV-IRR and MVD-IRR, were constructed which contained double or triple alanine mutations in the L2 domain, as described in . The third construct contained swapping of the FnIII-1 domain and was named Fn1-IRR (A and ). Wild type IRR and PV-IRR, MVD-IRR, or Fn1-IRR constructs were analyzed in this test. In the case of wild-type IRR, the activation curve in logarithmic (effect versus pH) coordinates reflected a sharp sigmoid-shaped response with a half effect at pH 8.5 (EC = 4.1 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcM), saturation at about pH 9.2, and a Hill slope of 2.4 \u00b1 0.4, as calculated by GraphPad software analyzed the data through a nonlinear regression of \u201cone site-specific binding with Hill slope\u201d type (B). Only PV-IRR construct showed positive cooperativity, albeit reduced, with a Hill slope of 1.6 \u00b1 0.3 and EC = 9.5 \u00b1 2.3 \u03bcM. Other tested constructs showed a loss of positive cooperativity; the Hill slope for the MVD-IRR mutant was 0.8 \u00b1 0.4 and for the Fn1-IRR mutant was 0.8 \u00b1 0.3. To correctly estimate the half-effect for MVD-IRR and Fn1-IRR constructs, we used nonlinear regression of \u201cone site-specific binding\u201d and obtained EC = 3.2 \u00b1 1.3 \u03bcM for the MVD-IRR mutant and EC = 15.6 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcM for the Fn1-IRR chimera (B). Thus, the EC of two constructs (PV-IRR and Fn1-IRR) shifted towards alkalinity. The two constructs, MVD-IRR and Fn1-IRR, lost positive cooperativity. We have previously shown that the activation of IRR by alkali involves multiple domains of its extracellular region, with the key role being performed by L1C domains . Our approach was based on the analysis of IR/IRR chimeras with IR extracellular domains introduced into full-length IRR. By bioinformatics analysis, we also identified the specific amino acid residues of IRR that might be important for its alkali sensing, and mutated them to alanine individually, or in combinations. Our findings are of interest since alkali-induced conformational changes in IRR may be related to mechanisms of IR and IGF-IR ligand-induced activation. Interpretation of the obtained data is currently possible only on the basis of the published three-dimensional structures of IR ectodomain and IGF-IR ectodomain fragment . The proposed lambda shape of the IR ectodomain (A) describes a homologous head-to-tail complex of two receptor subunits with axial symmetry. Due to the high sequence homology and identical domain structure within the IR family, it is possible to approximately position a specific IRR residue within the proposed IR model. Single mutations of vicinal amino acid residues M406, V407 and D408 of the L2 domain had little or no effect on IRR activity. However, the triple mutant showed significantly reduced activity (), stronger than chimera obtained by swapping L2 domains of IRR and IR . When the FnIII-1 domain of IRR was replaced with the one of IR, similar reduction of pH-sensing activity was observed thus suggesting that the interaction between L2 and FnIII-1 contributes, but is not critical, to the receptor response (A). Since the pH dependence analysis of L2 and FnIII-1 targeted mutants showed no positive cooperativity, these adjacent domains may constitute one of the pH-sensing sites of IRR. The unexpected finding that the double PV mutation in L2 results in a notable increase of IRR activity (), may be interpreted as a removal of constraints thus allowing higher flexibility of the interdomain joint. Positions of these strong hydrophobic amino acids in IR structure located at water contacts interface (A) and we suggest that mutations in these amino acids leads to some structural changes, which leads to reorganization of pH sensing sites in IRR ectodomain and changing of ability to sense more physiological pH about 7.9\u20138.2 to increase sensing of high pH about 9.0. Our finding that FnIII-2 and FnIII-3 domains together play a key role in IRR pH sensing agrees well with the previously determined importance of L1C domains that come in contact with FnIII-2 and -3 domains of the second subunit (A). Notably, recent IR/insulin crystallography and NMR studies demonstrated binding of the \u201copen\u201d conformation of insulin to the CT peptide of IR, that belongs to the FnIII-2 domain, closely to the interface with the L1 domain . However, our experiments with a chimera and mutant in the CT region failed to detect any detrimental effect on the IRR pH sensitivity. Since IRR does not bind insulin, it is likely that its conformation in the region of the CT peptide/L1C contact differs significantly from that of IR. We may speculate that the non-active form of IR contains structural restraints that are released by insulin binding whereas IRR has different clamps of the surface charge nature located elsewhere that are released by a pH change and result in additional interdomain interactions. Indeed, a major change of the IR and IRR conformation upon activation was directly observed in the detergent phase distribution assay . A similar model was recently proposed for the activation of IGF-IR by IGF-1 binding . The positive cooperativity of IRR and its absence in some of the mutants suggest that at least two major sites of pH-induced \u201cadhesion\u201d exist that are separated spatially but act in a concerted manner.", "IR has been described in diabetes mellitus, obesity, infection, sepsis, trauma, painful states such as postoperative pain and migraine, schizophrenia, major depression, chronic mental stress, and others. In arthritis, abnormalities of glucose homeostasis were described in 1920; and in 1950 combined glucose and insulin tests unmistakably demonstrated IR. This paper delineates that IR is either based on inflammatory factors (activation of the immune/ repair system) or on the brain (mental activation via stress axes). Due to the selfishness of the immune system and the selfishness of the brain, both can induce IR independent of each other. Based on considerations of evolutionary medicine, it is discussed that obesity In 1916, the diabetologist Elliott P Joslin recognized that 'hyperglycemic situations appear after infectious diseases, painful conditions such as gall stones, and trauma' [ Over the last century, IR was found in physiological states, disease states, and diseases such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, infection, sepsis, arthritis of different types (including rheumatoid arthritis (RA)), systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, trauma, painful states such as postoperative pain and migraine, schizophrenia, major depression, and mental stress, to name the most important (chronology of events is summarized in Table History of insulin resistance from different perspectives of research in the fields of diabetology, infection/inflammation, pain, mental activation, trauma, and rheumatology. CNS, central nervous system; DIAGRAM, DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis Consortium; HPA, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal; IL, interleukin; IR, insulin resistance; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test; SNS, sympathetic nervous system; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. When considering these diseases and disease states, one observes two major clusters of clinical entities that are linked to IR: inflammation with an activated immune/ repair system; and increased mental activation. In this clearly defining distinction, obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) can be integrated into the first cluster due the inflammatory aspect of IR in these entities [ Since chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs) such as arthritis were among the first to be linked to IR [ Originally, IR was defined as a subnormal biologic response to a certain insulin concentration, whereby the word subnormal already suggests illness. In this early paper, they described a state of IR in T2D patients: '... [there is a] lack of responsiveness of blood sugar, in the face of apparently adequate amounts of insulin secreted ...' [ Classical signs of insulin resistance until 1995 [ IR is measured by different techniques, whereby the gold standard is the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and the silver standard is the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (Table Methods to measure insulin resistance. The first viable theory on IR was presented by Randle, who suggested that IR in muscle and adipose tissue is based on the glucose-fatty acid cycle [ Further clarification throughout the 1960s and 1970s came from endocrine diseases that were accompanied by IR. The explanatory power of hormones is particularly obvious in diseases with an overproduction of a distinct glucogenic hormone such as in Cushing's syndrome (cortisol), acromegaly (growth hormone), pheochromocytoma (catecholamines), glucagonoma, thyrotocicosis (thyroxine, triiodothyronine), and insulinoma (IR as a consequence of insulin receptor desensitization) [ Physiological conditions and disease states with upregulated stress hormones were found to be accompanied by IR, such as in psychological stress, psychiatric disease, starvation, fasting, and others (Table In addition, several authors indicated the central role of the brain because it dictates nutrient intake and foraging behavior. Excess energy intake Nowadays, inflammation-mediated IR is another important explanatory platform of IR in adipocytes, myocytes, and hepatocytes [ In addition to the cytokine-centered theory of IR, a relatively new aspect is nutrient-induced inflammation that leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress, activation of jun-N-terminal kinase, and inhibition of insulin receptor substrate-1 and AKT (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1) and, thus, IR in the liver and adipose tissue [ In this short pathophysiology collection of IR, we recognize again the two clusters linked to IR: inflammation with an activated immune/repair system; and increased mental activation (mood, food intake, stress and stress axes). Possibly, published theories on IR with an evolutionary perspective might help to explain the two clusters. The theories of IR are summarized in Table Characteristics of theories on insulin resistance as observed from an evolutionary medicine standpoint. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Ikk\u03b2, inhibitor of nuclear factor-\u03baB kinase \u03b2; IR, insulin resistance; JNK, jun-N-terminal kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PTB-1B, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B; SOCS3, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3; TLR, toll-like receptor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. aThis is a special form of IR without hyperinsulinemia on the basis of a strong response of counterregulatory hormones. It is questionable to call it IR because of missing hyperinsulinemia and missing inflammation. Another theory of starvation-induced IR proposes that IR of the muscle during fasting is a positively selected program to maintain high circulating glucose levels in order to protect muscle from proteolysis during starvation [ Another important theory of IR is the thrifty phenotype hypothesis [ Based on the thrifty genotype hypothesis, IR and immune activation were recognized as an adaptive positively selected program to combat infections (the fight infections theory of IR). The activation of the immune system during infectious disease and inflammation induces IR, which leads to redirection of glucose to the activated immune system [ Similarly based on the thrifty genotype theory is the breakdown of robustness theory, which states that a robust glucose control system developed during evolution. The breakdown of this robust glucose control system induces positive disease-stabilizing feedback loops leading to IR. This leads to increased food intake and the resulting obesity induces IR [ Finally, the good calories-bad calories theory explains that our present food is markedly different from paleolithic food. Particularly, high energy-dense carbohydrates are consumed too often, which induces inadequate hyperinsulinemia [ In conclusion, the theories already indicate that IR can be an important aspect to support the brain and the activated immune system. As such, IR can be seen as a positively selected program to support the brain or immune system. At this point, I recapitulate that IR increases circulating glucose and free fatty acids that are not taken up in adipose tissue, liver, and muscle, and are now freely available to all non-insulin-dependent tissues. In contrast, the immune system profits from insulin because it is an important growth factor for leukocytes and, with the help of insulin, major glucose transporters like glucose transporter-3 and glucose transporter-4 are upregulated on all leukocyte subpopulations [ One important factor of IR is overproduction of hepatic glucose [ Energy expenditure of systems and organs under sedentary conditions (approximately 10,000 kJ/day) In conclusion, while IR is most often regarded as a pathological state to be treated, these numbers and the fact that IR is linked to so many diseases and disease states are indicative of a beneficial role of IR. While the value of IR can be estimated from the abovementioned numbers, the generation of the two disease clusters is not yet clear. We recently delineated that allocation of CAEN to the brain and muscles happens mainly during daytime, while allocation of CAEN to the immune/repair systems happens at night [ Coming back to the Introduction, with this model the two clusters of clinical entities linked to IR become understandable in terms of energy regulation. One recognizes two independent organs - the selfish immune system, and the selfish brain [ With the chronic inflammatory and chronic mental diseases that induce IR (listed in Table While an acute response is often adaptive and physiological to correct alterations of homeostasis, a chronic disease process is often accompanied by the wrong program [ The acute activation of the immune/repair system is outstandingly important to fight acute infections and trauma. In the acute situation of emergency for a loved one, family members and hospital staff show strong mental activation that can lead to a higher state of activity, a better readiness to take action, but also poor sleep and symptoms of anxiety [ However, long-term caregivers of, for example, Alzheimer disease patients are more often obese than noncaregivers, demonstrate alterations typical of the metabolic syndrome, show a higher risk to develop major depression, and have a long-term increase in proinflammatory markers [ This small collection demonstrates that activation of the immune/repair and central nervous systems are successful in acute emergency, but dangerous when applied chronically, leading to typical signs of obesity, metabolic derangement with IR, chronic inflammation, and increased risk for cardiovascular events [ Earlier, it was demonstrated that a highly activated immune/repair system cannot be switched on for a long time because this would be very energy consuming [ I hypothesize that energy consumption and energy protection are the most critical determinants in evolution, to undergo either negative selection or positive selection, respectively. Sometimes microbes such as Similarly, neuronal memory can largely decrease time to accomplish successful foraging in the wild [ Another example of positively selected gene variants is observed for food ingestion and fat storage (not IR! Indeed, female Another important indication for positive selection of fat storage networks (not IR) is given by the fact that the number of adipocytes in humans is determined before puberty [ In conclusion, networks are positively selected if they serve acute, highly energy-consuming situations, which are terminated within 3 to 6 weeks. We perceive a chronic disease when it lasts for longer than 6 weeks, as used in classification criteria in RA and juvenile idiopathic arthritis [ With all this information, one can generate a new model of IR that builds upon the existing theories. When one compares serum levels of IL-6 as measured with the identical quantitative high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, healthy subjects range between 1 and 2 pg/ml [ IR is an unfavorable factor in CIDs because it supports the already activated immune system. IR is a direct consequence of the proinflammatory load. Thus, IR should be treated by neutralizing inflammatory cytokines or by inhibiting the immune system with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in a more general way (like salsalate for T2D). Since IR is a very direct consequence of immune system activation, the primary goal is anti-inflammatory treatment. In CIDs, further treatment of IR beyond good inflammatory control is expected not to be needed. Since IR is a perfect diagnostic marker of an activated energy reallocation program (inflammation and mental activation), measuring IR might be a suitable biomarker to study the control of systemic inflammation in CIDs. Since several cytokines induce IR in a redundant manner, IR might be a more integral systemic diagnostic marker than C-reactive protein, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or single cytokines. In addition to aspects of IR in CIDs, this review demonstrates an extended theory of IR that classifies IR as a beneficial positively selected program to support activation of the immune/repair system and the brain. IR makes sense in acute alterations of homeostasis in the context of short-lived diseases but is a misguided program in long-term inflammatory and mental activation. \u2022 IR is a consequence of mental activation (neuroendocrine axes) or inflammation that is a consequence of selfishness of the brain or the immune system. \u2022 IR has been positively selected during evolution for short-lived energy-consuming activation of the brain or immune system. \u2022 Long-term IR supports mental disease and CIDs because energy-rich fuels are provided to these non-insulin-dependent tissues (continuous activation). \u2022 IR in CIDs is treated by consequent reduction of the proinflammatory load. \u2022 Treatment of IR in morbid obesity and T2D is more complex because both inflammatory and neuroendocrine pathways need to be targeted. The pleiotropic anti-inflammatory and central nervous effects of salsalate constitute the first positive drug therapy of IR in T2D. CAEN: controllable amount of energy; CID: chronic inflammatory disease; IL: interleukin; IR: insulin resistance; RA: rheumatoid arthritis; T2D: type 2 diabetes mellitus; TNF: tumor necrosis factor.", "Here we show that treatment with IR leads to mitotic chromosome segregation errors Radiation therapy is an integral modality in cancer treatment Another form of genome instability, present in the majority of solid tumours, is numerical (or whole-) chromosomal instability (w-CIN) Given the interrelatedness of w-CIN and s-CIN, we asked whether IR could directly generate numerical chromosomal abnormalities. Experimental and clinical evidence suggest that, in addition to direct DNA breaks, IR can lead to changes in chromosome number The sensitivity of cells to IR is not only dependent on the amount of DNA damage that immediately results from IR exposure, but on pre-existing damage or the inability to repair this damage are also important determinants of cellular viability Here we use high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy and xenograft mouse models to directly examine the consequences of IR exposure during mitosis on chromosome segregation and structural integrity as well as cellular karyotypes. We then experimentally reduce mitotic whole-chromosome missegregation rates to dissect the role of w-CIN on cellular viability We recently showed that IR exposure during mitosis directly induces chromosome segregation errors in a dose-dependent manner To further assess the consequences of IR exposure, we exposed cells to 6 Gy and performed fluorescence We then asked whether the frequency and types of chromosome segregation errors were dependent on the time interval between IR exposure and the analysis of anaphase chromosome segregation. To address this, we assessed chromosome segregation errors in HCT116 To determine whether IR can directly perturb the process of chromosome segregation We next exposed HCT116 In addition to aneuploidy, lagging chromosomes can lead to downstream defects that culminate in structural chromosomal damage To assess the relative levels of DNA damage in the micronuclei compared with the primary nuclei, we measured the fluorescence density of \u03b3-H2AX. Without irradiation both primary nuclei and micronuclei had equivalent densities of \u03b3-H2AX fluorescence, which then significantly increased 25 min after IR exposure. As expected, \u03b3-H2AX density in primary nuclei was significantly lower 12 h after IR exposure compared with 25 min, congruent with DNA repair activity ( To corroborate that this extra-nuclear chromosomal damage occurs as a result of mitotic chromosome segregation errors, we measured lagging chromosomes 25 min after irradiation in U251 cells overexpressing GFP-Kif2b ( To ensure that GFP-Kif2b overexpression did not alter the formation of direct DSBs in irradiated cells or the influence their ability to repair these breaks in primary nuclei, we measured relative \u03b3-H2AX fluorescence intensity in irradiated mitotic cells and found no difference between control and GFP-Kif2b-overexpressing cells ( Mitosis has long been recognized, for unclear reasons, as the most radiation sensitive phase of the cell cycle To test the relationship between chromosome segregation errors and tumour response to radiation Our work uncovers an additional layer of genome damage induced by IR, beyond direct DNA breaks, which occurs outside of the primary nucleus. We show that when IR is delivered to mitotic cells, it can directly lead to errors in whole-chromosome segregation, which subsequently leads to the formation of micronuclei and chromosome pulverization hours to days later ( This multilayered genomic damage represents a plausible explanation for the exquisite sensitivity of mitotic cells to IR The magnitude of the effect of Kif2b overexpression The dependence of irradiated mitotic cell sensitivity on chromosome missegregation rates offers insight into recent findings where patients diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma with elevated pre-treatment chromosome segregation errors are more likely to respond to chemoradiation therapy The severe structural damage caused by the effect of IR on mitotic cells has important consequences on the small subset of cells that survive radiation treatment.", "Three experimental groups were established in male Sprague-Dawley rats: (1) sham group, (2) IR with normal saline group, (3) and IR with HRS group. A rat model of skeletal muscle IR injury was induced by 3-h tourniquet occlusion on its left hind limb and 4-h reperfusion. The wet/dry ratio increased significantly in the IR group (P < 0.01 compared with that in the sham group) and decreased significantly in IR with HRS groups (4.12 \u00b1 0.14 versus 4.12 \u00b1 0.14, P < 0.01 compared with that in the IR group). Muscle tissues and serum of the IR group had significantly increased levels of MPO, MDA, \u2022OH content, and decreased SOD activities compared with the sham group (P < 0.01). The activity of SOD in the IR with HRS group was greatly elevated compared with that in the IR group (295.028 \u00b1 9.288 versus 249.190 \u00b1 5.450 in muscle tissues; 91.627 \u00b1 2.604 versus 73.4045 \u00b1 6.487 in serum; P < 0.01), whereas the levels of MPO, MDA, and \u2022OH content were clearly reduced (MPO: 0.5649 \u00b1 0.0724 versus 1.0984 \u00b1 0.0824 in muscle tissues; 0.7257 \u00b1 0.1232 versus 1.3147 \u00b1 0.0531 in serum. The integrated optical density of positive amethyst staining increased significantly in the IR group (P < 0.01 compared with that in the sham group) and decreased significantly in IR with HRS group (928.79 \u00b1 234.537 versus 3005.972 \u00b1 83.567, P < 0.01 compared with that in the IR group). Muscle tissues of the IR group had significantly increased levels of Bax, cytochrome C, LC3B content, and decreased Bcl2 activities compared with those in the sham group (P < 0.01). The activity of Bcl2 in the IR with HRS group was greatly elevated compared with that in the IR group (0.2635 \u00b1 0.0704 versus 0.1242 \u00b1 0.0662; P < 0.01), whereas the levels of Bax, cytochrome C, and LC3B content were clearly reduced (Bax: 0.3103 \u00b1 0.0506 versus 0.5122 \u00b1 0.0148; cytochrome C: 0.4194 \u00b1 0.1116 versus 0.8127 \u00b1 0.0166; LC3B: 0.5884 \u00b1 0.0604 versus 1.3758 \u00b1 0.0319; respectively, P < 0.01). HRS seems to be effective in attenuating IR injury in skeletal muscle via its antioxidant, anti-apoptosis, and anti-autophagy effect.", "Several preclinical studies have investigated the mechanisms associated with cranial IR-induced hippocampal dysfunction such as memory defects and depression-like behavior. Thus, this review may be helpful to gain new mechanistic insights into hippocampal dysfunction following cranial IR and provide effective strategies for potential therapeutic approaches for cancer patients receiving radiation therapy.", "Pretreatment with Shh peptides protected U373MG and U87MG cells against IR in a dose-dependent manner. Cyclopamine increased Shh plus IR-induced H2AX, a marker of DNA double-strand breaks, in these cells. To verify the role of Shh signaling in the radiosensitivity of GBM cells, we tested the effect of the Gli family zinc finger 1 (Gli-1) inhibitor zerumbone and found that it could sensitize GBM cells to IR. Pretreatment with Shh peptides protected both WOX1-overexpressed U373MG and U87MG cells against IR and increased the cytoplasmic Shh and nuclear Gli-1 content.", "AZD2281 enhanced IR-induced apoptosis to a more significant level under chronic hypoxic condition (0.2% O(2), 48 hour) than under normoxic condition.", "Briefly, 5% (w/v) Tissues (femora and ileum) from live mice were collected at 1.25, 4, 9, 16, 25 and 40 days post IR and fixed in formalin solution. After antigen retrieval, tissue sections (1.25 days post 10 Gy IR) were incubated overnight with primary antibodies against NF-\u03baB p65 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), followed by incubation with the secondary antibody for 1 h at 23\u00b0C. Live mice at 4, 9, 16, 25 and 40 days post IR were killed by an overdose of anaesthetic, and marrow cells were obtained from the femora (by flushing with a 22-gauge needle) and resuspended in serum-free medium. Cells (10 Cell aliquots were obtained from the femora of mice 1.25 and 4 days post IR by flushing with serum-free medium. After red blood cells were removed with Zapoglobin, cells were incubated for 20 min at 4\u00b0C with antibodies conjugated with phycoerythrin and fluorescein isothiocyanate against the mouse cluster of differentiation (CD)34 and CD45 (CD34 Total cell protein from ilea 1.25 days post IR was separated by SDS-10% PAGE, transferred to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), blocked in 5% non-fat dried milk, and incubated with primary rabbit polyclonal anti-I\u03baB\u03b1 (Ser32/Ser36) antibody (Millipore, Bedford, MA, diluted 1:500 in 0.1% milk powder in TBS-T) or GAPDH (Cellsignal, Danvers, MA, diluted 1:1000 in 0.1% milk powder in TBS-T) for 3 h at 23\u00b0C or overnight at 4\u00b0C. An assay using bead technology (0.025\u20130.05 ml per assay for several cytokines) was adopted to determine the levels of multiple cytokines in mouse plasma 1.25, 4 and 9 days post IR. After 10 Gy irradiation, mice exhibited a considerable decrease in the number of bone marrow cells and instead their bone marrow was full of red blood cells, especially four days post IR (IR group). Treatment with PGN (P group) or WR-2721 (W group) alleviated the bone marrow depletion by causing an increase in myelogenic cells, but WR-2721-treated mice exhibited haemorrhages (1.25 days post 10 Gy IR). In contrast, 4 days after irradiation, mice in the WR-2721 + PGN (W + P) group showed the presence of newly formed microvessels lined with endothelial cells, and small round haematopoietic cells were also apparent around the microvessels ( WR-2721 + PGN combined treatment decreased bone marrow damage and increased numbers of CFU-GEMM and CD45 No CFU-GEMM clones were found in the bone marrow of irradiated mice 16 days after 10 Gy IR, even after PGN or WR2721 single treatment. The number of CFU-GEMM clones observed in WR-2721 + PGN mice 40 days post-IR did not markedly differ from the number observed in unirradiated mice ( Taken together, the data from bone marrow H&E staining, the proportion of CD45 Histological changes in the ilea were characterized by the adherence of submucosal layers and sloughing of crypts, as well as ulcers and ruptured villi in 10 Gy irradiated mice ( Treatment with PGN and WR-2721 in combination normalized ileum villus height and number of crypts after 10 Gy WBI. N = unirradiated mice, IR = 10 Gy WBI mice, P = 10 Gy WBI mice treated with PGN, W = WR-2721-treated 10 Gy WBI mice, P + W = PGN and WR-2721 combination-treated 10 Gy WBI mice (original magnification \u00d7200). On Day 1.25 post IR, villus height and number of crypts in the P and W groups group had not changed obviously compared with the IR group, and marked differences could be observed in comparison with the N group. However, on Day 4 post-IR, the P + W group had longer villi and more crypts compared with the IR group (* As xylose is not metabolised in the body, the WR-2721 and PGN promoted recovery of intestinal absorption in irradiated mice. On Day 3 after 10 Gy IR, the absorption rate of mice treated with WR-2721 + PGN demonstrated a clear difference from that of mice exposed to 10 Gy irradiation ( Lgr5 has recently been identified as a murine marker of intestinal stem cells [ Both single treatment with WR-2721 or PGN and combination treatment augmented intestinal Lgr5 expression and activated NF-\u03baB following irradiation. ( Most NF-\u03baB p65 protein was located in the cytoplasm 1.25 days after IR, showing that IR did not activate NF-\u03baB. In the PGN group, IL-5 and IL-6 levels were similar to those in the IR group. The combination of WR-2721 and PGN was unable to reverse the increase in IL-6 observed following IR ( In this study, we observed that WR-2721 and PGN improved survival of irradiated mice following 10 Gy WBI by improving the condition of their bone marrow (H&E stain, CD45 Adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting and hypotension have been reported for WR-2721. The human equivalent dose (910 mg/m However, even with combined PGN and WR-2721 treatment, half of the irradiated mice did not survive for 30 days, but began to die at 10 days post 10 Gy IR.

We discovered that rod responses from Monoclonal anti-IR antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Photoreceptor-specific conditional insulin receptor knock-down mice were prepared as previously described with the Cre-lox technique To create photoreceptor-specific Retinas from wild type and ROS were prepared from mouse retinas with discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation as previously described Suction-electrode recordings were made from single mouse rods by methods previously described Photoreceptor-specific conditional insulin-receptor knock-down mice were prepared as previously described To insure that the knocking down of the Recent experiments have indicated that rod-specific iCre75 transgenic mice contain a second transgene that results in greatly enhanced expression of the GTPase accelerating protein R9AP, resulting in accelerated photoreceptor response decay In Our previous experiments have shown that the IR can be activated by bright light exposure. Although the mean current of We were surprised to discover that the effects of knocking down the insulin receptor were similar on dark-adapted and light-adapted rods ( Our experiments on Our experiments indicate that neither Grb14 nor IR is necessary for the production of the phototransduction cascade that generates the electrical response of the rod. In contrast, studies from our laboratory clearly suggest that IR is essential for photoreceptor survival R.R.", "To investigate changes in brain chemistry after AIE, markers of acetylcholine (ie, ChAT+ IR), dopamine, and norepinephrine (ie, TH+ IR) were determined. Some samples were lost during brain dissection and neurochemical analyses, resulting in the following sample sizes for each region included in the analyses: ChAT+ IR in cholinergic nuclei Ch1,2: control, AIE-exposed rats exhibited significantly lower levels of ChAT+ IR in cholinergic nuclei Ch1,2 (medial septal nucleus and nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal band, respectively; Choline acetyltransferase-positive immunoreactivity (ChAT+IR) in the forebrain is decreased in adult rats after adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure. Left, Quantification of ChAT+ IR cell density. Right, Representative photomicrograph of TH-positive IR neurons in the prelimbic cortex in adult control and AIE-exposed rats (from 3.2 to 2.2mm from bregma; To investigate possible associations between the neurochemical alterations and probability discounting, correlational analyses were performed between histochemical staining and risky choice. For each individual rat, ChAT+ IR and TH+ IR levels were correlated with the AUC of the discounting functions generated during the descending probability series ( Correlations between choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity cell counts and area under the curve (AUC) of the probability discounting function in the Ch1 and Ch2 nuclei (medial septal nucleus and nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal band) (A) and Ch3 and Ch4 nuclei (lateral portion of the horizontal limb nucleus of the diagonal band, nucleus basalis, and parts of diagonal band nuclei) (B) of the basal forebrain. The correlation between ChAT+ IR in the Ch1 and Ch2 nuclei and AUC (left) was significant ( The results of the present study demonstrate that AIE exposure had long-term effects on risky decision making and brain neurochemistry. Additionally, compared with controls, AIE-exposed rats had decreased levels of TH+ IR in the prelimbic cortex and decreased levels of ChAT+ IR in the basal forebrain. Moreover, the area under the discounting curve was negatively correlated with ChAT+ IR in the basal forebrain, suggesting that the loss of ChAT+ IR may contribute to increased risky decision making. Adult AIE-exposed rats (PND 215) had reduced levels of ChAT+ IR, a marker of cholinergic neurons, in the basal forebrain, including the medial septal nucleus, vertical limb nucleus, and lateral portion of the horizontal limb nucleus of the diagonal band, and nucleus basalis. Similarly, reduced ChAT+ IR has been reported in young adult rats (PND 72) exposed to ethanol vapor during adolescence ( The basal forebrain, through widespread projections to the cerebral cortex, may be involved in learning and memory, executive function, and impulsivity ( Findings indicate that dopamine transmission in prefrontal cortical areas, including the infralimbic and prelimbic cortices, may be involved in decision making in the probability discounting task ( In summary, our findings provided strong evidence that exposure to intermittent ethanol binges throughout adolescence led to increased risky decision making in adulthood. Specifically, decreased TH+ IR in the prelimbic cortex and decreased ChAT+ IR in the basal forebrain were observed in adult AIE-exposed rats.", "Purified HDHB stimulates Rad51-mediated 5\u2032-3\u2032 heteroduplex extension Human osteosarcoma U2OS cells [ HCT116 cells stably expressing HDHB shRNA or control shRNA were generated as described previously [ Clonogenic survival assay was performed as described [ HCT116 cells were grown on glass slide and irradiated by 5 Gy IR.

However, the formation of RPA late-stage foci after IR was impaired and/or retarded in HDHB-depleted cells.", "", "[ Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was applied to estimate the degree of IR. The equation used to obtain this value is as follows: HOMA-IR = (fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) \u00d7 insulin (mU/ml))/22.5. HOMA-IR > 2.14 were considered insulin resistant according to our previous study. MiRNAs which may interact with CYP17, GATA6, IRS-2, and glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) were searched using TargetScan 6.2. qRT-PCR analysis was performed to validate the miRNA microarray results in this study. Two-tailed Ovarian theca tissue samples were obtained from 10 PCOS patients with IR and eight age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched non-PCOS infertile women who had normal insulin sensitivity and normal serum androgen level. Using miRNA microarray analysis, we evaluated miRNA expression profiles of ovarian theca tissues of PCOS with IR patients and non-PCOS, non-IR controls. miRNA = Micro-ribonucleic acid; IRS-2 = insulin receptor substrate 2; GATA6 = GATA-binding factor 6. The distribution of the data which was calculated by RQ = 2 In present study, we have for the first time tried to identify the differential expression of miRNAs in the ovary of women with and without PCOS, HA, and IR; and integrated the findings with the expression patterns of certain specific genes from the same cohort of specimens. MiR-92a has been associated with cancer pathogenesis and has been reported being significantly downregulated in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),[ PCOS is a complex and heterogeneous endocrine condition characterized by HA, hyperinsulinemia, and/or IR. IR accompanied by mild compensatory hyperinsulinemia is a common feature of women with PCOS. Two important androgen producing-related genes, CYP17, GATA6, and one insulin receptor gene, IRS-2 were shown to be expressed significantly higher in PCOS theca tissue compared with non-PCOS ones in our previous study. Significantly downregulation of insulin signaling factors targeted miRNAs in the ovarian theca tissue of PCOS patients with HA indicated that hyperinsulinemia and/or IR was perhaps the cause of HA.", "These hybrid receptors are present in tissues and cell lines expressing both IR and IGF1R. The hybrid receptor specificity is obtained from a combination of two specific antibodies for IGF1R and for an IR tyrosine phosphorylation site. IR exists as two splice variants; consequently, two splice variants of hybrid receptors can be expressed. More specifically, by increasing the relative expression level between IGF1R and IR, cells have been shown to lose their insulin sensitivity because hybrid receptors bind insulin with low affinity IGF1 and IGF2 have been shown to bind to hybrid receptors with high affinity whereas human insulin binds with low affinity In order to study whether the antibody combination of IGF1R 24\u201331 and IR pY1334 could be used in a specific hybrid receptor-activation assay, immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE analysis were first performed ( In order to quantitatively compare the activation of insulin/IGF1 receptor hybrids by ligands, an ELISA was developed using the antibody combination described above. The specific hybrid ELISA was created by coating 96 well plates with IGF1R specific 24\u201331 antibody, with detection using IR pY1334 antibody. Representative concentration\u2013response curves from activation of Hybrid-A and Hybrid-B are shown in It is important to distinguish between IR and IGF1R homodimer and insulin/IGF1 receptor hybrid activation. This novel method enables specific and quantitative measurements of the hybrid receptors in cell lines and tissues by the use of specific IGF1R and IR PTyr antibodies. It has been difficult to measure hybrid activation specifically because hybrid receptors will only be present when IR and IGF1R are co-expressed, hence homodimer receptors will also be present. Studies of IR and IGF1R activation use immunocapturing of IR or IGF1R with specific antibodies, followed by analysis with antibodies for tyrosine phosphorylation; alternatively, it can be done the other way round. Studies have been carried out using hybrid receptors The specificity of the antibody combination 24\u201331 and IR pY1334 for hybrid receptor activation was shown by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of lysates from BHK cells overexpressing IR, IGF1R or both. There are two specific tyrosine residues at the C-terminal end of IR: IRY1328 and 1334. IGF1R has tyrosine at the C-terminal end but the adjacent amino acids are not conserved, giving the specificity for IR. In this report, data have been shown for IR pY1334 only, but the other IR tyrosine phosphorylation site, IR pY1328, gave similar results (data not shown). It is a human hepatoma cell line known to have IR, IGF1R and the hybrid receptors There is some disagreement as to whether insulin binds to Hybrid-A with high affinity Human insulin and IGF1 was provided by Novo Nordisk (Bagsvaerd, Denmark). IGF1R specific antibody 24\u201331 Activation of insulin/IGF1 receptor hybrids were studied in HepG2 cells and in BHK cells overexpressing human IGF1R and IR-A or IR-B. As control cells, BHK cell lines overexpressing IR-A or IGF1R alone were included. The plate was washed with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS and incubated for 1 hour with IR antibody pY1334 1:500 dilution in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20.

In general, the cardiac targeting efficacy of the conjugates in MI and IR rats was approximately 2; however, different changing in targeting efficacy with time was observed between MI and IR rats and also between the conjugates. The goal of this study was therefore to further characterize the passive targeting behaviors of mono-PEGylated ROPs in both MI and IR. The assay system consisted of an Agilent 1200 series HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with a fluorescence detector set at \u03bb The MI and IR were induced by permanent ligation and transient ligation of the left coronary artery, respectively, as described previously. The infarcted area was determined by triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining in both MI and IR rats. Rats in normal, MI, and IR groups were given Data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. The infarct size in MI rats suffering from 4-day ligation of the left coronary artery was 17.3%\u00b14.2% (n=4), and the value in IR rats suffering from transient 30-minute ligation and subsequent 24-hour reperfusion was 34.5%\u00b17.7% (n=3). The representative photographs of transverse slices following TTC staining are shown in Heart and plasma levels of the conjugates in normal, MI, and IR rats at 3, 12, and 24 hours after a single intravenous dose of 4 \u03bcmol/kg are listed in It was well known that macromolecular and nanoparticle carriers were capable of passively accumulating in solid tumors via the EPR effect. Taking into consideration the following two factors \u2013 1) the increased vascular permeability caused by the IR injury persisted for at least 48 hours and gradually recovered within 2 weeks; In general, there are three main factors that would affect drug distribution in the ischemic zone, that is, the tissue perfusion flow rate, the elimination half-life of drug, and the vascular permeability. In IR, microvascular obstruction has been confirmed to happen in the ischemic regions.", "The aims of the study were twofold: (1) to investigate the benefits of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major catechin found in tea, after IR challenge, and (2) to elucidate the mechanism of EGCG inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression. Wistar female rats were divided into four groups: normal control, EGCG with sham operation, retinal IR, and EGCG with IR groups. IR injury to a rat's retina was induced by raising intraocular pressure to 150 mmHg for 60 min. With EGCG pretreatment, retinal ganglion cell death from IR was reduced by approximately 10% 3 days afterward. EGCG significantly downregulated IR-induced glial fibrillary acidic protein expression. EGCG treatment also reduced TUNEL-positive cells after IR in the inner retina as well as IR-induced lipid peroxidation. Histological analyses showed fewer neuronal NOS and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase-positive cells in the retina after IR with EGCG administration. Therefore, EGCG is effective in protecting retinal ganglion cells from IR challenge by ameliorating retinal nitrosactive stress and by regulating cell death through apoptotic pathways.", "This study evaluates the effect of HBO on IR-stimulated neutrophil adhesion and polarization of expressed CD18 adhesion molecules using a novel in vitro adhesion assay and confocal microscopy. Percent adherence to ICAM and CD18 polarization was evaluated in the following five groups: (1) Nonischemic control, n = 15; (2) 4 h ischemia (IR, n = 15); (3) 4 h ischemia with HBO treatment (100% oxygen at 2.5 atmospheres absolute (IR + HBO, n = 15)); (4) 4 h ischemia with 100% oxygen at room temperature and pressure (RTP) (IR + normobaric hyperoxia, n = 5); and (5) 4 h ischemia with 8% oxygen at 2.5 atmospheres absolute (IR + hyperbaric normoxia, n = 5). Neutrophils exposed to IR plasma showed a significant increase in percent adherent (0.8 +/- 0.1% versus 16.7 +/- 2.2%, P < 0.05) and polarized cells (6.2 +/- 1.7% versus 43.9 +/- 12.2%, P < 0.05) compared to controls. Normobaric hyperoxia and hyperbaric normoxia did not affect neutrophil adherence or CD18 polarization following IR. Direct HBO treatment of neutrophils did not change the percent of polarized cells in IR. Hyperbaric oxygen inhibits IR-induced neutrophil adhesion by blocking CD18 surface polarization and requires plasma exposure to HBO.", "We analyzed the expression levels of apoptotic genes in wild type and Dmp53 null mutant animals after UV or IR using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Ark (Apaf-1 related killer) was induced in a Dmp53-dependent way upon UV treatment but not by IR, hid (head involution defective/wrinkled) was induced upon both types of DNA damage, while reaper was induced only upon IR but not UV treatment. Some but not all of these genes show Dmp53-dependent activation upon IR treatment as well.", "The IR protocol used led to a 4.5-fold increase in serum AST levels and drastic changes in liver histology, with significant GSH depletion and enhancement of protein carbonyl levels and of the protein carbonyl/GSH content ratio, whereas NF-kappaB and AP-1 DNA binding was decreased and enhanced, respectively. In a time window of 48 h, T(3) exerted protection against hepatic IR injury, with 88% reduction in the protein carbonyl/GSH ratio and normalization of NF-kappaB and AP-1 DNA binding, changes that were suppressed by NAC administration before T(3). Data presented suggest that a transient increase in the oxidative stress status of the liver is an important trigger for T(3) preconditioning, evidenced in a warm IR injury model through antioxidant intervention.", "Overexpression of the PPARgamma1 in human hepatocellular (HepG2) cells was associated with decreased IR gene transcription and protein expression levels, and these reductions were more evident in the presence of TZDs. Since no PPARgamma response elements were identified on the IR promoter, we postulated that PPARgamma adversely affects the IR gene transcription by perturbing the assembly and stability of the transcriptionally active multiprotein-DNA complex identified previously, which includes the high-mobility group A1 protein, the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor (Sp1), the CAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPbeta), and, in some cell lines, the developmentally regulated activator protein-2 (AP-2) transcription factor. Using glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays combined with electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that by interacting with Sp1, C/EBPbeta, and AP-2, PPARgamma can prevent Sp1/AP-2 protein-protein association and inhibit binding of Sp1 and C/EBPbeta to DNA, thus reducing IR gene transcription. Our results demonstrate that IR is a new target gene of PPARgamma, and support a potential use of TZDs as anti-proliferative agents in selected neoplastic tissues overexpressing IRs.", "The IR possesses an intrinsic tyrosine kinase (TK) activity which is stimulated by insulin binding. We had earlier reported that human plasma o~2-HS glycopro- tein (cx2-HSG) inhibits insulin-stimulated mitogenesis at the level of IR-TK (Mol Endo 7: 1445-1455, 1993). We examined the insulin-stimulated Ras signalling pathway in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells overexpressing the human IR. %-HSG inhibits insulin-in- duced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and the subsequent association of GRB2, as well as Sos, with IRS-1. These results suggest that, while insulin's mitogenic effects can be abolished by inhibition of insulin-induced IR-TK, propagation of signals for metabolic activities might utilize alternate or rescue mechanisms. This event leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of tRS-1, Sch, IRS-2 and probably other, yet to be identified, substrates. IRS-1, by virtue of its multiple phosphorylated tyrosine residues, binds several SH2 domain-containing proteins. Although the critical nature of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (IR- TK) in mediating insulin action is well documented [4-61, * To whom correspondence should be sent. Received 6 January 1996; accepted 1 July 1996. researchers have described some biological actions of insu- lin that are independent of the IR-TK [7-9]. Identifying physiological regulators of the IR-TK would advance our understanding of the insulin signalling in normal and pathological states. We have demonstrated (1) that the product of the human AHSG gene, ~2-HSG, acts as a specific inhibitor of the human IR-TK. Baculoviral expression of human oq-HSG yielded a much more potent IR-TK inhibitor compared to that purified from circulating human plasma [10]. Having identified the specific effect of ~x2-HSG at the proximal (IR-TK, IRS-I ty- rosine phosphorylation) and the distal (DNA synthesis) levels of insulin signalling, we here explore effects of the re- combinant inhibitor in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells over- expressing the human insulin receptor (CHO-IR), on the insulin-induced mitogenic signal transmission distal to IRS- 1 activation. The primary mechanism in- volved is increased in the GTP-bound form of Ras through the association of the pre-existing GRB2-Sos complex with either tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 or Shc proteins [1, 13]. We demonstrate here that ot2-HSG inhibits insulin-in- duced Ras activation through IRS-1. RESULTS oq-HSG Inhibits Insulin.induced IR and IRS.1 Phosphorylation as Well as Subsequent Association of GRB2 with IRS.1 The initial event characterizing insulin binding to its recep- tor is the autophosphorylation of the IR ~-subunit on spe- cific tyrosine residues. This autophosphorylation activates the intrinsic TK activity towards cellular substrates such as IRS-1 and Shc. IRS-1 then, via its multiple tyrosine phos- phorylated sites, acts as a docking protein for other signal- ling molecules, such as GRB2, containing SH-2 domains. o~2-HSG (10 ~M) completely inhibited both the insulin- induced autophosphorylation of the IR [3-subunit (Fig. 1A), the phosphorylation of IRS-1 (Fig. 1B) as well as the insu- lin-induced association of the 23 kDa GRB2 protein with IRS-1 (Fig. A Insulin u, -HSG IR i~-subunit--~ C Insulin %-HSG 4, + -- + 4- + + 4, B 4- P. R. Srinivas et al. GRB2-~ FIGURE 1. cxz-HSG inhibits insulin-induced autophosphoryla- tion, IRS-1 phosphorylation and subsequent association of Grb2 with IRS-1. WGA purified CHO-IR were subjected to insulin- induced autophosphorylation in the absence (lane 2, panel A) or presence of 0.25 ~tM, 5.0 I~M and 10 p.M (lanes 3, 4 and 5 re- spectively, panel A) of recombinant ~x2-HSG. There is a dose de- pendent inhibition of IR ~-subunit in the presence of increasing concentrations of recombinant a2-HSG. To assess the effect of ~2-HSG on insulin-induced IRS-1 phosphorylation, serum- starved CHO-IR cells were stimulated with insulin in the pres- ence (lane 3) and absence (lane 2) of ot2-HSG as described. After washing and lysis, the supernatants from the cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-IRS-1 antibodies and immu- noblotting with, either anti-phosphotyrosine (panel B), or anti- GRB2 antibodies (panel C). Insulin (200 nM) induces a strong association of GRB2 with IRS-! oLz-HSG Inhibits Association of GRB2/Sos Complex with IRS. Insulin induced formation of a complex between Sos and IRS-1 via GRB2 (Fig. There was no as- sociation of the GRB-2/Sos complex with IRS-1 in the basal state. (x2-HSG (10 b~M) inhibited this association with IRS-1 by more than 75%. Insulin induced tyro- sine phosphorylation of the 52 kDa form of Shc in CHO- IR cells (Fig. Effect of oLz-HSG on insulin-induced Sos association with IRS-1. Confluent dishes of CHO-IR cells were treated as above, but after immunoprecipitation with anti-IRS-1, the trans- ferred proteins were probed with polyclonal rabbit antibodies to Sos. There is no association of Sos with IRS-1 either in the basal state or when treated with cxz-HSG alone (lanes 1 and 2 respec- tively). Insulin induces an association between IRS-1 and Sos, via GRB2, which is inhibited by about 75% in the presence of cxg-HSG (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). CHO-IR cells were serum starved and stimulated with either insulin alone (lane 2, lane 1 is basal), or in the presence of 5 lttM (lane 3) or 10 ~M ~2-HSG (lane 4). Insulin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the 52 kDa form of the Shc protein in these CHO-IR cells which was com- pletely inhibited in the presence of A2-HSG. In all our experiments in CHO-IR, involving Shc, we only observed insulin- stimulated tyrosine phos- phorylation of the 52 kDa form. [20] have demonstrated that the predominant insulin- depen- dent Shc signalling, in the CHO-IR, occurs through the 52 kDa isoform. Insulin-induced sequestering of the Sos-Grb2 complex, via tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1. When CHO-IR cells were metabolically labelled with [32p]-orthophosphate and then stimulated with insulin, a 4.2-fold increase in GTP levels was detected in the Ras immunoprecipitates (Table 1). CHO-IR cells were metabolically labelled with p~P] orthophosphate as described and then incubated with 200 nM insulin for 10 min in the presence or absence of 10 btM cq-HSG. The CHO-IR cells were processed and labelled with [3zp] as described and immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti.raf antibodies (4A). oq-HSG Does Not Inhibit Hexose or Amino Acid Uptake in CHO-IR cells Insulin (200 nM) induced modest glucose transport, as mea- sured by the PH]2-DOG uptake, in CHO-IR cells (Table 2).

Glucose uptake was assayed by the pH]-2-DOG taken up by the CHO-IR cells. For amino-acid uptake measurements, CHO-IR cells were treated with p4C] aminoisobutyric acid and transport was measured after a 3 h incubation. Insulin induced a 2.5-fold increase in aminoisobutyric acid uptake in the CHO-IR cells. With the identification of down- stream substrates of IRTK, involvement of specific proteins has become evident. The SH2 domain-containing proteins dock on specific residues of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1, in response to insulin [28], while those with SH3 domains, which recognize specific proline- rich sequences [16], then bind such downstream effector molecules as the guanine nucleotide releasing factor, Sos. The ubiquitous Shc protein is tyrosine-phos- phorylated by the IR in response to insulin [29]. In this study, we investigated whether the effect of e~2-HSG on insulin- induced mitogenesis was mediated through its effect on the Ras signalling pathway in CHO-IR cells. 1, cx~.HSG, at 10 IxM, inhibited the insulin- induced association of Grb2 with IRS-1. At the same con- centration, it also inhibited the association of Sos with the IRS-1 molecule through Grb2. The major mechanism re- sponsible for inhibition of this pathway, by cx2-HSG, would presumably be via inhibition of insulin-induced IR-TK. We had earlier reported [1] that human o~i-HSG inhibits the IR- TK activity and, also, completely inhibits insulin-induced mitogenesis in the H-35 rat hepatoma cell line. The situa- tion might be more complex since: (a) In the CHO-IR cells, oq-HSG does not completely abolish the association be- tween the tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 and Sos complex, or p21r~'~ activation, (b) cx2-HSG completely inhibits the in- sulin-induced Raf phosphorylation. These observations indicate that insulin may utilize pathways in addition to PY- IRS-1/Grb2/Sos to mediate its mitogenic effects through the Ras pathway. Experiments with L6 myoblasts, treated with insulin or IL-4, have revealed that the association of Grb2/Sos with IRS-1 plays a very minor role in MAP kinase activation and mitogenesis [32]. Additional studies have also suggested that Shc may be more important than IRS-1 in coupling the IR to MAP kinase activation [3, 33, 34]. PI-3-kinase has been shown to be critical for in- sulin-induced mitogenesis in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts [35], while the protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHPTP2, was demon- strated to regulate insulin signalling in a fashion parallel to Ras, in CHO-IR cells cotransfected with dominant interfer- ing SHPTP2 mutants [36]. The functional concentration of recombinant 0q-HSG (0.1 ~M), required to inhibit the insulin-stimulated IR-TK and mitogenesis, is approximately 100-fold lower than that required when using the ~2-HSG purified from plasma [10]. Clearly, it is possible that residual activity of the IR- TK, that is not inhibited by cx2-HSG, is sufficient to me- diate metabolic actions (vide infra). However, there have been many reports indicating that the TK activity of the IR is not essential for mediating some of the metabolic effects of insulin. Mutant IR's (serine substituted at Trpl200), ov- erexpressed in cells, exhibit normal glucose transport and glycogen synthesis although they are deficient in autophos- phorylation, DNA synthesis and both p21'~ and MAP ki- nase activation [40, 41]. Additionally, monoclonal antibod- ies, which activate glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis, have no apparent effect on the basal TK activity of the IR [42]. The spe- cific activity of PI-3 kinase is enhanced, by binding to tyrosine phosphorylated IRS-1, in response to insulin [44]. We have earlier demonstrated that plasma c~2-HSG inhibits insulin-induced association of PI-3 kinase with IRS-1. In light of the data rai- sing doubts about the essential role of fully activated IR-TK for some aspects of insulin's metabolic signalling, it has been suggested that [46,47] minimal TK activity is neces- sary for the IR to mediate metabolic actions and that mini- mal IR occupancy (2-5%) leads to full mobilization of glu- cose transport. As stated above, it is possible that residual IR-TK activity, not inhibited by oq-HSG, could mediate the metabolic stimulus of insulin. However, since CHO- IR cells do not exhibit very pronounced metabolic responses to insulin, more responsive cell lines and physiologically rele- vant target tissues, such as skeletal muscle and fat, are being screened to confirm the inability of ~2-HSG to inhibit the metabolic activities induced by insulin. In a parallel experiment, the same recombinant c~2-HSG sample, when injected into rats together with insulin, com- pletely inhibited the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphory- lation of IR and IRS-1 in liver and muscle (data not shown). MATERIALS AND METHODS ImmunoprecipitatioTts and Immunoblotting Confluent dishes of CHIR were serum starved for 12 h in F12 medium and then treated with 200 nM insulin in the presence or absence of 10 ~M c~2-HSG for 5 rain. Supematants were used for immunoprecipitation with monoclonal anti-IRS-1 or anti MAP kinase 2 antibod- ies (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY, USA). CHO-IR cells were serum starved for 14 h. The cells were then preincubated with phosphate free medium for 2 h, followed by incubation with 100 I~Ci of [32p] orthophosphate/dish for another 3 h. The cells were stimulated with insulin (200 nM), in the presence or ab- sence of c~2-HSG, with ot2-HSG alone, or with buffer alone for 10 rain. Labelling of Raf Confluent dishes of CHO-IR dishes were serum-starved as above, washed and incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, containing 500 ~Ci of [32p] orthophosphate, for 3 h at 37. Confluent plates of CHO-IR cells, maintained in se- rum-free medium, were washed in HBSS containing 17 mM NaHCO3 and 1 mg/ml BSA and incubated in fresh HBSS at 37, 5% CO2, for 2 h. Cells were further incubated for a period of 3 h in fresh medium containing the various con- centrations of uz-HSG and insulin (200 nM).", "Stat5b-Ct is tyrosine phosphorylated by purified IR kinase domain in vitro. Insulin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of overexpressed Stat5b-Ct and endogenous Stat5 in cells overexpressing IR. Stat5 may be a direct target of the IR and, as a member of the Stat family of transcription factors, may play a role in the regulation of gene transcription by insulin. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that IR interacts with and phosphorylates Stat5 in vitro and in tissues physiologically sensitive to insulin.", "Treatment with IR (10 Gy) induced both downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax at 2 to 5 hours post-IR in 5 of 8 (63%) wt-p53+ lines, leading to apoptosis. Conversely, lines that failed to both downregulate Bcl-2 and upregulate Bax after IR were resistant to apoptosis. There were no obvious changes in the expression of Bcl-x1 in these lines after IR. However, among the p53-null lines, resistance to IR was observed only in those expressing high levels of Bcl-x1. These results suggest that expression of Bcl-2 but not Bcl-x1 is p53-dependent and that IR-induced downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax occur in most wt-p53+ lines and are associated with radiosensitivity. Furthermore, high-level expression of Bcl-x1 occurs predominantly in p53-null lines and is associated with resistance to IR-induced apoptosis in these lines, indicating differential expression and regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x1 in pediatric ALL.", "By contrast, in vivo autophosphorylation and IRS-1 phosphorylation appear quantitatively normal, and only partial alterations of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation are observed. Mutation of the N3 site results in partial defect of IR activation. These data provide evidence for (i) glycosylation of each N-linked glycosylation site of the IR beta subunit, (ii) absence of correlation between internalization and transmembrane signaling, and (iii) a major role for oligosaccharide side chain(s) located close to the cell membrane in IR activation and transmembrane signaling.", "We find that although the majority of these foci are ATM-dependent, approximately 10% of IR-induced gamma-H2AX foci require, instead, functional ATR. This indicates that even in the absence of DNA replication, a distinct subset of IR-induced damage is recognized by ATR.", "After IR, ATM phosphorylates serine residue 222 of FANCD2. The phosphorylation of SMC1 by ATM, after the ATM-dependent activation and recruitment of NBS1 and BRCA1 to double-strand breaks, is thought to play an important role in the cellular response to IR. To detect SMC1 phosphorylation, LCLs were irradiated with 10 Gy of IR and harvested after 1 h. Nuclear extracts and immunoblotting were performed as detailed below. Both FANCD2 and SMC1 are phosphorylated in an ATM-dependent manner and both are involved in the S phase checkpoint response after IR (). We wanted to examine whether SMC1 activation was associated with cellular responses to IR in cells with FANC pathway defects, as they are in cells from patients with A-T, NBS1, or Mre11 deficiency. After IR (), both ser966 and ser957 sites appeared normally phosphorylated in cells from the FA-A, FA-D2 (a, lanes 2 and 6), and FA-G LCLs (b, lane 2). We used radioresistant DNA synthesis to evaluate an IR-inducible S phase checkpoint () (). This checkpoint is thought to represent the inhibition of replicon initiation by DNA damage and is measured as a decrease in [H]thymidine incorporation 30\u201360 min after IR. These data suggest that SMC1 phosphorylation is not directly correlated with radiosensitivity, even though FA patients appear to be as sensitive to IR as A-T and NBS patients. IR activates the phosphorylation of FANCD2 in an ATM- and NBS1-dependent manner (). They found that of the 14 FA patients who underwent IR, 6 had complications that may have been related to the IR.", "cSLO IR-imaging, however, is always combined with a OCT scan, which facilitates collection of additional information not only in patients with vasculopathy. So far, there are no reliable and valid criteria for labeling blood vessels in cSLO IR-images recorded by OCT-scanners. A review of the ophthalmological literature yielded criteria originally developed for automatic analysis of CFP The aim of this study was: to develop reliable and valid criteria for labeling retinal blood vessels in cSLO IR-images, to investigate whether the criteria defined for automatic analysis of CFP can also be applied for cSLO IR-images, to propose standard operating procedures for further studies in neurological diseases. The IR-images were pseudonymized, exported by Heidelberg EyeExplorer, and uploaded to an ImagJ-Plugin for measuring vessel diameter ( The inter-rater agreement between the two raters was measured using Cohen's kappa coefficient. Consequently, they needed to be adapted to the nature of cSLO IR-images. Decisions were based on the initial results, on anatomical and physiological facts, and on the different technical features of the OCT and cSLO IR-Images. In cSLO IR-images, the center of the optic disc is often outshined. cSLO IR-Images were obtained and labeled as in the exploratory part of the study. The vessels in these fundus images were labeled by the ophtalmologist and used as reference for the labeling of the cSLO IR images. In the next step, we compared labeled cSLO IR-images and labeled CFP. The consequences of eliminating AC_1, AC_4 and AC_5 are summarized in Because of the high frequency of AC_1 in the case of zero main criteria ( Our study aimed to establish valid and reliable criteria for blood vessel labeling in cSLO IR-images, obtained by SD-OCT scanners used in parallel to OCT images. The OCT scanner produces black-and-white cSLO IR images; the fundus image on the other hand is a colored photograph. In spite of these curtailments, the method presented here, which involves using cSLO IR-images produced by an OCT scanner for the purpose of investigating blood vessels has many benefits: high reliability (\u03ba = 0.840) high validity (\u03ba = 0.957) time-saving method \u2013 only one rater required.", "When an illuminated enzyme-immobilized bulb was immersed in protein solution, the emitted IR radiation could trigger and accelerate heterogeneous protein digestion.", "Sevoflurane has been reported to protect against neuronal apoptosis during cerebral IR. However, the effects of sevoflurane preconditioning on spinal cord IR injury remain unclear. The results showed significant upregulation of MMP-9 in rats with IR-induced inflammation of the BSCB compared to that of the sham group, manifested as dysfunctional BSCB with increased Evans blue extravasation and reduced expression of occludin protein. Preconditioning with 2.4% sevoflurane attenuated spinal cord IR injury by inhibiting recruitment of microglia and secretion of MMP-9; thus inhibiting downstream effects on inflammatory damage to BSCB integrity and neuronal apoptosis. These data suggest that sevoflurane preconditioning may provide a new practical method for protecting against perioperative spinal cord IR injury. The sham group rats were subjected to sham operations without IR injury. The IR group rats were subjected to a 14-min occlusion of the aortic arch followed by reperfusion. Sevoflurane preconditioning + IR group rats (S-IR) were pretreated with inhalation of sevoflurane before induction of IR injury. In parallel, IR + MMP-9 siRNAs or control RNA group rats (Si-IR or Con-IR) were intrathecally injected with 5 \u03bcg MMP-9 siRNA or control RNA (Jima Inc., Shanghai, China) at a concentration of 1 \u03bcg /\u03bcL once a day starting 2 days before ischemia. MMP-9 siRNA: 5\u2032-GACUUGCCGCGAGACAUGAtt-3\u2032 (forward), 5\u2032-UCAUGUCUCGCGGCAAGUCtt-3\u2032 (reverse); control RNA: 5\u2032-GACUUCGCGGGACACAUGAtt-3\u2032 (forward), 5\u2032-UCAUGUGUCCCGCGAAGUCtt-3\u2032 (reverse) [ Preconditioning with sevoflurane was performed as previously described [ After reperfusion, neurologic function was quantified by two observers who were blinded to the experimental procedures at a 6 h interval during a 36 h observation period using a Tarlov scoring system, as follows: 0 = no lower limb function; 1 = perceptible lower limb function with weak antigravity movement only; 2 = some movement of lower limb joints with good antigravity strength, but inability to stand; 3 = ability to stand and walk, but not normally; and 4 = normal motor function [ All rats were anesthetized with an overdose of pentobarbital 36 h after IR injury and the L4\u2013L6 segments of spinal cords were rapidly collected for analysis because of their vulnerability to ischemic injury. Normal neurons were defined as viable by the presence of basophilic stippling (containing Nissl substance), whereas necrotic or dead neurons were identified by the presence of a diffusely eosinophilic cytoplasm with pyknotic homogenous nuclei, according to our previously validated protocol [ At 12 h and 36 h after IR injury, EB content and EB fluorescence were used for quantitative and qualitative examination of BSCB integrity, as previously described [ To measure the expression of MMP-9 in microglia, double immunofluorescence staining of MMP-9 and the microglia marker Iba-1 was performed as described previously [ A TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling) assay is the most commonly used technique for examining apoptosis via DNA fragmentation.", "Exposure to IR often triggers the onset of p53-dependent apoptotic pathways. Cell response to IR involves several protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, as well as the formation of free radicals that alter cellular biochemistry The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a main mediator of cell response to genotoxic stress. p53 regulates apoptosis via both transcription-dependent and -independent pathways With accumulating experimental data, we are now in a better position to construct more detailed models for p53-mediated signal transduction in response to IR and use them as a platform for evaluating new polypharmacological strategies. Here, we focus on the biochemical network associated with IR-induced apoptosis and examine the time-dependence of p53-mediated apoptotic events. Our approach incorporates cell heterogeneity and subcellular localization, and aims at estimating the response to targeted therapies following IR. We consider several outstanding issues: (i) the significance of the oscillatory behavior of p53 in determining the onset of downstream apoptotic events in response to IR, (ii) the role of its transcription-dependent and -independent activities in regulating cell susceptibility to apoptosis, (iii) the effect of the interactions involving anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and pro-apoptotic Bax on cell fate, (iv) the impact of the positive feedback loop mediated by Bid/caspase-3, and (v) the efficacy of various treatment strategies, e.g. how particular combination therapies may elicit anti-apoptotic responses to mitigate IR-induced damage. Our results indicate that p53 oscillations are insufficient to induce apoptosis We first constructed a mathematical model for the biochemical network associated with IR-induced apoptosis. Second, as To establish initial concentrations of proteins that take into account of cell-to-cell variability, we first performed a run of 300 h to allow the system to reach steady state conditions in the absence of IR. Then, we changed the system parameters to account for IR-induced perturbations, and allowed the system to evolve. The p53 level oscillate with a ~5.5 h period due to radiation exposure ( A crucial insight that emerges from these findings is that IR-induced cell death depends on the coupling between the regulatory p53 module and downstream apoptotic cascade of events, and among the two regulatory activities of the p53 module, transcription of pro-apoptotic proteins appears to be more effective that those driven by the translocation of p53 to the mitochondria. Two of the possible ways that this strength can differ in cells is through truncation of Bid by caspase-3 and through activation of Bax by tBid (controlled by In the sections above, we have analyzed the dynamics of apoptotic mediators in response to IR. Of special interest are treatment strategies that are effective even if not administered immediately after IR exposure. Recently, Batchelor Our model analysis showed that the p53 oscillatory behavior in response to IR is not, Several experimentally testable results emerge from the analysis: (i) oscillatory behavior of PUMA in response to radiation damage ( The last two points are especially relevant to developing efficacious therapies to regulate apoptosis. The full list of components, reactions and kinetic equations, and parameters are presented in the (A) Comparison of stochastic ( The time profiles of p53 (A) Caspase-3 time profile for different rates of p53 transcriptional activation of pro-apoptotic proteins (represented by Panels A and C show onset of apoptosis ( (A\u2013B) Time evolution of the concentrations of PUMA, caspase-3, and tBid at in response to long time IR exposure predicted for two different coupling strengths of p53 transcriptional activation to mitochondrial pore opening events (represented by Panels (A) and (B) show the effects of therapies based on single targets, PUMA, Bid, caspase-3, Bax, or their combination when inhibitors are administered at 15 min (A) and 12 h (B) after radiation exposure.", "In conclusion, the long-term administration of dexamethasone caused IR, which was associated with significant reductions in both mass and flux rate of the salivary glands.", "However, there are no reports describing the effect of arbutin on IR-induced apoptosis.", "CBX8 depletion also led to accumulation of spontaneous DNA damage and raised the sensitivity of tumor cells to IR or H2O2.", "Adipose endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is increasingly recognized as the primary factor governing these conditions, which ultimately result in the initiation of IR or the aggravation of pre\u2011existing IR. This review focuses on the mechanism by which ER stress in AT can contribute to IR.", "In the context of pregnancy, maternal obesity (MO) induces IR in the offspring. Interestingly, several proteins associated with obesity-induced IR are also involved in EC migration, providing a potential link with the ER stress-dependent alterations observed in obese individuals. For example, diabetic and other models of retinopathy are associated with distorted retinal angiogenesis, which has been related to ER stress ( Altered nutritional state is becoming a relevant and growing public health issue globally [ Obesity and overweight during pregnancy are well-recognized independent risk factors that contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome and several diet-related anomalies not only in the mother, but also in the fetus through fetal programming [ Using a murine model of MO, feeding dams a high-fat diet resulted in increased inflammation, ER stress markers, and IR in hypothalamic tissue of the MO offspring (post-natal day 28) compared to the control group ( In another study, using a similar model of diet-induced obesity, it was shown that MO offspring have increased ER stress and inflammatory markers compared to the control group ( Altogether these data show that MO induces ER stress through fetal programming in murine models. First, human chorionic gonadotropin has been shown to increase the proliferation of HUVEC in the presence of various adipokines, such as IL 6, leptin, adiponectin, and TNF-\u03b1 ( Considering that: (1) MO results in distorted angiogenesis; (2) obesity has been associated with ER stress and IR; and (3) IR-related proteins also play a role in cell migration (RhoA, Akt), we hypothesize the possible contribution of different IR-related and others proteins to the modulation of EC migration capacity in the context of MO-dependent ER stress ( Putative migration-related targets of ER stress signaling. RhoA and its downstream signaling has been linked to IR because they have targets such as Akt and eNOS ( The contribution of RhoA to EC migration has been observed using a dominant-negative model and by its inhibition using ADP-ribosylation after bacterial toxin exposure. Supporting this notion, ER stress is associated with IRE1, which acts as an upstream protein of RhoA signaling ( The Akt gene encodes three isoforms (Akt1-3). We focus on the potential involvement of two main mechanisms of disease observed in obesity, ER stress, and IR. Finally, based on the hypothesis of intrauterine programming during pregnancies affected by adverse conditions and the induction of ER stress and IR in the presence of obesity, we suggest that MO might induce fetal ER stress and IR, two intracellular mechanisms associated with altered EC migration and hence distorted angiogenesis in offspring endothelium.", "We challenged the hypothesis that lower limb IR might also impair lung, renal, and liver mitochondrial respiration. Pulmonary damages have been thus largely involved in patient mortality and morbidity through decreased FIO Liver damage related to lower limb ischemia-reperfusion was less demonstrated but, in view of the detoxification role of the liver, it might concentrate inflammatory cells triggered by lower limb IR and should be affected, as previously reported in the setting of gut IR [ Kidneys are particularly concerned in the remote alteration phenomenon after skeletal muscle ischemia-reperfusion injuries. showed renal dysfunction on a Wistar rat model with bilateral hindlimb IR injuries [ Mitochondria are key factor involved in skeletal muscle alteration during lower limb IR, and, interestingly, skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunctions occur early and are reversible after therapy [ Protecting remote organ mitochondria might therefore be a goal since mitochondrial dysfunction might lead to the multiorgan failure syndrome. However, very few data [ The aim of this study was therefore to challenge the hypothesis that lower limb IR results in lung, renal, and/or liver mitochondrial oxidative capacities impairment. IR decreased lung maximal oxidative capacity ( Thus, as inferred from the data obtained with each specific substrate we observed that complex I of the lung mitochondrial respiratory chain was impaired by lower limb IR. Indeed, lower limb IR caused a slight, not statistically significant, increase in liver mitochondrial respiratory values ( Thus, lower limb IR failed to alter liver mitochondrial function, and all complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complexes I, II, III, and IV) showed a similar 9% trend to increase their activities. Both renal Thus, complexes I, II, and III activities of the mitochondrial renal respiratory chain were enhanced after IR. Mitochondrial coupling was enhanced in kidney after lower limb ischemia-reperfusion (6.5 \u00b1 1.3 versus 8.8 \u00b1 1.1; Liver and kidneys tissue sections, stained with haematoxylin-eosin, demonstrated normal architecture and thus no change was observed after IR (data not shown). In this view, investigation on remote organ mitochondrial functions might be particularly interesting since mitochondrial dysfunction occurs early in skeletal muscles submitted to IR and is likely to be avoided using adapted strategies of ischemic or pharmacologic conditioning [ Although we showed no lung mitochondrial alteration after lower limb IR secondary to aortic cross-clamping in rats [ Taken together, these data support that circulating factors might be responsible for the reduced mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes observed after lower limb IR. This is consistent with the fact that humans liver dysfunction is observed mainly when lower limb IR is complicated by a shock, linked to multiorgan failure [ Concerning the kidneys, we expected to observe impairments in mitochondrial respiration. Indeed, many experimental and clinical reports demonstrated that kidneys are key targets in the setting of IR. demonstrated a \u201crelationship between intraoperative leg ischemia and postoperative renal failure, providing epidemiological evidence that the ischemic leg may be an important contributor to rhabdomyolysis-like renal morbidity after thoracoabdominal aortic surgery\u201d [ The kidney functional enhancement observed in this study might correspond to the fact that kidneys had to filter circulating toxic whose numbers highly increase during lower limb IR. This might help discover new pattern of mitochondrial activities in different organs, and, particularly, this might allow determining when and why lung and kidneys functions are impaired after lower limb IR. Better knowing the pathophysiology of lung injury might help to focus therapeutic approach on lung mitochondrial functions, since they were beneficial for skeletal muscle in lower limb IR settings. C: control; IR: ischemia-reperfusion.", "Exendin-4 (Ex-4), a GLP-1 receptor agonist, was subcutaneous injected to the IR rats and T2DM rats for 4 weeks. The expression of CTRP3 mRNA and protein in epididymis adipose tissue of rats at the stage of IR was lower significantly than that of normal control (NC) rats and decreased more when they were at the stage of overt T2DM (all Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease characterized by insulin resistance and pancreatic islet beta cells dysfunction. The remaining 36 rats were fed with high-fat diet which consisted of regular feedstuff, sucrose, lard, fresh egg, and milk power (protein 16%, carbohydrate 38%, fat 46%, and total energy 20.54 KJ/g) according to one of our former studies [ Rats of NC group, IR group, DM group, DM + Ex-4 group, and IR + Ex-4 group at week 15 were anesthetized with pentobarbitone (80 mg/kg) after overnight fasting. Under the hyperinsulinemic conditions, the steady glucose infusion rate (GIR) required to maintain euglycemia is a standard measure of the whole-body insulin sensitivity.

Because basal OS in type 2 diabetic patients is influenced by the consumption of AGEs, we examined whether AGE consumption also affects IR and whether AGER1 and SIRT1 are involved. Expression and activities of AGER1 and SIRT1 were examined in patients\u2019 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMNC) and in AGE-stimulated, AGER1-transduced (AGER1 Insulin and homeostasis model assessment, leptin, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and nuclear factor-\u03baB p65 acetylation, serum AGEs, and 8-isoprostanes decreased in AGE-restricted type 2 diabetic patients, whereas PMNC AGER1 and SIRT1 mRNA, and protein levels normalized and adiponectin markedly increased. AGEs suppressed AGER1, SIRT-1, and NAD Food-derived pro-oxidant AGEs may contribute to IR in clinical type 2 diabetes and suppress protective mechanisms, AGER1 and SIRT1. Insulin action is regulated by multiple factors, including SIRT1, a member of the sirtuin (silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog) 1 family of NAD The increasing prevalence of IR and type 2 diabetes is directly related to the Western lifestyle and diet ( Glycoxidants are partially absorbed as food-derived AGE peptides and AGE lipids by mechanisms not fully elucidated ( In the current study, we investigated the relationship between IR and dietary AGEs in type 2 diabetic patients. We report that AGE restriction lowers insulin levels, markers of IR, and inflammation. In addition, the suppressed expression and function of AGER1 and SIRT1 in diabetic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMNCs) are nearly normalized by AGE restriction, consistent with restoration of host defenses. Daily dietary AGE content, from 3-day food records that emphasized cooking methods, was estimated from a database that listed AGE values of \u223c560 foods and was expressed as AGE equivalents/day (AGE Eq = 1,000 kilounits) ( Derivatives of PMNCs were separated from fasting, EDTA-anticoagulated blood by Ficoll-Hypaque Plus gradient (American Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) and used to isolate mRNA and protein ( THP-1 human monocytes (1 \u00d7 10 Synthetic preparations of CML-BSA (23 CML-Lys/mol), MG-BSA (22 MG-Arg/mol) ( AGER1, receptor for AGE (RAGE), the 66-kDa protein from the src homology and collagen homology domain (p66 AGER1, forward primer 5\u2032-CTGGGGCTCTTCATCTTCAG-3\u2032, reverse primer 5\u2032-GTTGCATCTCCCACAGAGGT-3\u2032; RAGE, forward primer 5\u2032-AGGAGCGTGCAGAACTGAAT-3\u2032, reverse primer 5\u2032-TTGGCAAGGTGGGGTTATAC-3\u2032; p66 NOXp47 SIRT1, forward primer 5\u2032-CGGAAACAATACCTCCACCT-3\u2032, reverse primer 5\u2032-CACCCCAGCTCCAGTTAGAA-3\u2032. Differences of means between groups were analyzed by the Student Significance of changes during the interventional study was assessed by comparing The type 2 diabetic patients, age- and sex-matched with nondiabetic control subjects, had similar levels of creatinine clearance ( AGER1 and SIRT1 mRNA levels in PMNCs from diabetic subjects were significantly lower than in healthy subjects ( AGE restriction (by 50%), without altering nutrient intake, led to markedly lower levels of sCML and sMG, as well as 8-isoprostanes in type 2 diabetic subjects ( Intervention: Changes in biochemical, metabolic, and cellular parameters in diabetic patients and in healthy control subjects after AGE restriction Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. Type 2 diabetic subjects on the regular diet showed no significant changes, except for higher sMG, iCML, leptin, and TNF-\u03b1 values ( The suppressed basal mRNA levels of AGER1 and SIRT1 in type 2 diabetic patients were increased by \u223c50%, almost to the normal range in the AGE-restricted cohort ( There was also a reduction in NF-\u03baB acetyl-p65 ( Because SIRT1 ( AGEs suppress AGER1, SIRT1 protein, and NAD IR remains an unresolved scientific and therapeutic problem. Increased OS and impaired anti-OS defenses are important factors in the development and persistence of IR ( Although endogenous glucose or lipids contribute to elevated AGEs ( AGE restriction normalized AGER1, SIRT1, and SIRT1-dependent NF-\u03baB p65 deacetylation levels, and there was a concomitant attenuation of proinflammatory mediators (i.e., RAGE and TNF-\u03b1) ( Given that downregulation of AGER1 ( Because this was the first time that AGEs and AGER1 were linked to the deacetylases and to SIRT1, we probed these relationships in inflammatory monocyte\u2013like THP-1 cells. After prolonged exposure to AGEs, AGER1 and SIRT1 were both suppressed in these cells or became unresponsive. AGEs acted via an OS-dependent decrease in NAD From a clinical perspective, AGE restriction markedly increased adiponectin levels and reduced the initially high leptin/adiponectin ratio, a marker of IR, indicating that AGEs also affect insulin-sensitive tissues ( These data show that chronic exposure to excessive exogenous (food) oxidants fosters an impairment in both native antioxidant defenses as well as insulin action and that reducing oral AGEs can ameliorate these defects.", "We investigated the association between metabolic parameters, IR and RBP4 during olanzapine therapy.", "Consistent with the reduction in IR levels observed by western blotting, IDE-KO adipocytes showed substantial impairments in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake ( In the present study, we investigated glucose homeostasis in mice lacking IDE, the principal protease involved in the clearance and inactivation of insulin Taken together, these findings have significant implications for both the etiology and the potential treatment of diabetes. For instance, repeated administration of insulin (up to 6U/day) to rats over a 2-week period led to reductions in both maximal insulin binding capacity and IR-mediated glucose utilization While the disturbances in IR levels and functionality we observed appear to offer a neat explanation for the emergence of the diabetic phenotype in IDE-KO mice, we emphasize that considerably more study will be required before firm conclusions can be made. Given that IDE is known to degrade other substrates involved in glucose homeostasis and diabetes pathogenesis, including glucagon The reduction in liver IR levels seen in IDE-KO mice are of special interest, because clearance of circulating insulin, which occurs primarily in liver, is initiated and rate-limited by IR-mediated internalization The precise mechanisms underlying the enhancement of insulin signaling induced by transient reductions in IDE are presently unclear. However, recent evidence suggests that suppression of IDE activity can also enhance insulin signaling subsequent to the binding of insulin to the IR From a therapeutic perspective, our results support the idea that pharmacologic inhibition of IDE, properly implemented, may represent a viable\u2014even attractive\u2014therapeutic approach to the treatment of diabetes.", "Radiation-induced tumors are associated with inefficient repair of IR-induced DNA damage and genome instability. Phosphorylation of histone H2AX (\u03b3-H2AX) is the initial event in repair of IR-induced DNA damage on the chromatin flanking the DNA strand breaks. We studied the molecular underpinnings of the age-related IR effects using an animal model. By assaying for IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX foci we analyzed the induction and repair of the DNA strand breaks in spleen, thymus, liver, lung, kidney, cerebellum, hippocampus, frontal cortex and olfactory bulb of 7, 14, 24, 30 and 45 days old male and female mice as a function of age. We demonstrate that tissues of younger animals are much more susceptible to IR-induced DNA damage. The mechanisms of cell and tissue-specificity of in vivo IR responses need to be further dissected. The maximum formation of \u03b3-H2AX foci was analyzed 30 minutes post-exposure, while persistent responses were studies 24 hours post-IR [ In somatic organs of the unexposed young 7 and 14 days old animals, the highest background levels of \u03b3-H2AX foci were seen in spleen (3.2\u00b10.4 foci per nucleus in 7 days old males, 2.8\u00b10.5 - in 7 days old females, 1.2\u00b10.2 - in 14 days old males and 1.4\u00b10.2 foci per cell in 14 days old females), while the lowest levels were seen in lung (0 foci per nucleus in 7 days old males and females, 0.1\u00b10.1 foci per nucleus in 14 days old males and 0.1 \u00b10.0 foci per nucleus in 14 days old females) and kidney tissue (0.1\u00b10.1 foci per nucleus in 7 days old males, 0.2\u00b10.1 - in 7 days old females, 0.3\u00b10.1 - in 14 days old males and 0.1\u00b10.0 foci per cell in 14 days old females) (Fig. The levels of induction and persistence of IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX foci can also be related to the proliferative capacity of the tissue. It has been shown that cycling cells, especially S-phase cells are the most sensitive to IR-induced DNA damage compared to cells in other phases of the cell cycle [ To check this hypothesis, we conducted double staining of the exposed and control mouse tissues for both \u03b3-H2AX and the proliferating cells nuclear antigen (PCNA), a marker of S-phase cells [ Data are presented as a percentage of cells with more than 4 \u03b3H2AX foci per cell. IR is a known risk factor for lung cancer [ IR exposure also caused DNA damage in brain of exposed mice. We observed a very significant accumulation of 1 Gy of IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX foci in all the studied regions (from 0.1-0.2 foci per nucleus in the un-irradiated brain tissues up to 6-10 foci per nucleus 30 minutes after exposure) (Fig. IR exposure activates a battery of DNA repair mechanisms that are crucial to maintain the genome integrity [ Western analysis of Ku70, Rad 51 and Pol\u03b2 proteins. Interestingly, in spleen we did not see any induction of Rad51 levels by IR. Our data show that tissues of young animals are much more susceptible to IR-induced DNA damage. Indeed, it has been shown that younger animals are more susceptible to IR induced tumors. Human data indicate that childhood IR exposure results in significantly higher rates of leukemias and brain tumors as well as memory and learning deficits. Furthermore, exposure to diagnostic irradiation also poses a significant threat to young children [ While comparing IR responses of somatic organs and brain regions we noted that brain areas have the lowest basal levels of \u03b3-H2AX and the highest repair potential, as seen by the resolution of the \u03b3-H2AX foci.", "First, fixed retinal wholemounts and fixed-frozen vertical sections and confocal microscopy determined the density and/or number as well as the localization of TH-IR and dopa decarboxylase (DDC)-IR DA ACs, disabled1 (Dab1)-IR AII glycinergic ACs, GABA-IR ACs and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-IR ACs. Fixed-frozen vertical sections revealed a decrease in the TH-IR plexus throughout the S1 IPL sublamina. In controls, the number of TH-IR DA ACs was not significantly different between dorsal and ventral retina ( To confirm the loss of DA ACs, three additional complimentary experiments were performed using the MD GLE group. First, confocal and stereological studies showed that GLE selectively and dose-dependently decreased the number of TH-IR and DDC-IR DA ACs and density of their processes in S1 sublamina of the IPL without affecting other AC types. The major finding was that GLE selectively and dose-dependently decreased the number of early-born TH-IR DA ACs, the density of their process and retinal TH content. First, GLE did not alter the number or relative ratios of other early-born ACs such as GABAergic (GABA-IR), cholinergic (ChAT-IR) or glycinergic (Dab1-IR). Confocal images of control, low- (LD), moderate- (MD) and high-dose (HD) GLE wholemounted retinas show a significant dose-dependent decrease in the number of TH-IR DA ACs. The expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), that co-labels with calretinin in IPL S2 and S4 ( Confocal images of the dorsal region of retinal wholemounts from control, LD, MD and HD GLE mice reveal that the number of ChAT-IR ACs in the INL was not different between treatment groups. In the INL, MAO-A-IR was greater than that of COX IV-IR. Primers were designed with either Roche primer database or Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) Primer Quest Quantification of amacrine cell populations in the inner nuclear layer (INL) TH: Tyrosine hydroxylase; IR: Immunoreactive; ChAT: Choline acetyltransferase; Dab1: Disabled1 Values represent the mean \u00b1 SEM for 500 \u00b5m Values represent the means \u00b1 SEM for 40 \u00b5m fixed-frozen transverse sections from three non-adjacent slides for three to five different mouse retinas per treatment group.", "We aimed to confirm the role of IR assessed by the homoeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) on SVR and to determine its magnitude. We performed meta-analysis of studies evaluating the impact of IR in HCV patients treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. SVR was less frequent in patients with IR than in patients without IR (mean difference: -19.6%, 95% CI: -29.9% to -9.4%, p<0.001). In sensitivity analyses according to HCV-1 patients, patients with IR also less frequently attained a SVR than patients without IR (mean difference: -13.0%, 95% CI: -22.6% to -3.4%, p=0.008). In addition, the baseline HOMA-IR index was lower in responders than in non-responders (mean difference: -0.92, 95% CI: -1.53 to -0.32, p<0.001). In sensitivity analyses restricted to HCV-1 patients, the baseline HOMA-IR index remained lower in responders than in non-responders (mean difference: -0.63, 95% CI: -1.13 to -0.14, p<0.001). HCV patients with IR have a 20% lower SVR than patients without IR. The baseline HOMA-IR index is a major determinant of SVR.", "IR is known to induce DNA DSBs, leading to the formation of phosphorylated H2AX-foci (\u03b3H2AX) at the site of DSBs (Fig. Therefore, we analysed the cell cycle distribution of HeLa cells treated with either IR, eto, CPT or HU. The preservation of nucleolar architecture upon IR treatment indicates ongoing transcriptional activity in the nucleolus. So, even though cells are actively transcribing rRNA as determined by EU incorporation, the processing of the rRNA precursor might still be affected by IR. Therefore, we examined transcription and processing of rRNA in unstressed and irradiated cells by metabolic labelling with [5,6- In conclusion, IR promotes the formation of the INB without disrupting nucleolar structure or function. The IR-induced formation of the INB was abolished by the short inhibition of RNA pol I transcription (Fig. Representative cell cycle profile of HeLa cells 3 h after exposure to 10 Gy IR ( High resolution image (TIFF 1214 kb) Analysis of nucleolar DNA associated with the INB.", "IR dose-dependently stimulated migration of glioblastoma cells which was sensitive to the BK channel inhibitor paxilline. Importantly, IR stimulated an increase in BK channel open probability but did not modify the total number of channels. Moreover, IR activated CaMKII in a paxilline-sensitive manner. Finally, inhibition of CaMKII by KN-93 abolished the IR-stimulated migration. We conclude that IR stimulates BK channel activity which results in activation of CaMKII leading to enhanced glioblastoma cell migration.", "In the present study, we examined IR-induced apoptosis in three closely related human lymphoblast cell lines that differ in p53 status. IR induced an early as well as a late phase of caspase-3 activation in TK6 but only a delayed onset in WTK1 and TK6-E6-5E cells. These results suggest that IR-induced apoptosis is mediated by a mechanism involving the caspase-3 cascade, which is shared by both p53-dependent and -independent pathways. The activation of caspase-3 by IR may thus engage at least two separate mechanisms, one through the regulation of the bcl-2 family members by p53, whereas the other yet-to-be-identified one involves neither p53 nor bax.", "Interactions between IR, Shc and regulatory subunits of the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI 3'-kinase) were characterized in the present study in liver and muscles of chickens submitted to various nutritional states. Importantly, Shc was immunoprecipitated by IR antibody (mostly the 52 kDa isoform) or by alphaIRS-1(mostly the 46 kDa isoform). IR-Shc association was decreased by fasting and restored by refeeding. In liver, antibodies to insulin receptor substrate-1 (alphaIRS-1), Shc or IR immunoprecipitated the three regulatory subunits of PI 3'-kinase and an equal PI 3'-kinase activity, without any residual activity left in the supernatants, suggesting the presence of a large complex involving IR, IRS-1, Shc (mainly the 52 kDa isoform) and PI 3'-kinase activity. The presence of another complex containing IRS-1 and the 46 kDa Shc isoform, but no PI 3'-kinase activity, is suggested.", "We may also be exposed to low doses of IR released to the environment from man-made sources, including fallout from nuclear weapons testing, discharges of radioactive waste, and consumer products. In addition, individuals may be exposed to IR during occupational activities related to nuclear technology, mining, high altitude airline travel, and deep space exploration [ During cancer radiotherapy, both malignant and normal cells are exposed to IR. These non-targeted effects can therefore be either detrimental or beneficial (if they lead to shrinkage of distant tumors), and have been termed \u201cabscopal effects.\u201d These diverse physiological effects of IR illustrate the in vivo occurrence of radiation-induced The spread of IR-induced effects among irradiated cells, between irradiated and non-irradiated cells, and their persistence in progeny of both targeted and non-targeted cells, can therefore have profound implications for long-term human health risks. The emergence of secondary cancers and other pathobiological conditions after radiotherapy [ Over the last two decades, as will be discussed in the following chapters, increasing evidence has been gathered that shows that the long-term effects of IR exposure are due to oxidative changes leading to the continuous accumulation of DNA damage in the progeny of both irradiated and non-irradiated bystander cells. Telomere shortening can also be accelerated by external environmental stress and lifestyle factors that cause DNA DSBs or mis-replication of telomeres such as IR and other oxidizing agents, oxidative stress, inflammation, hyperoxia, oncogenes, toxins, chronic viral infections, smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, stress, and even psychiatric conditions [ Telomeric regions (and sub-telomeric regions, extending at least 100 kb from the telomere) have been shown to be particularly sensitive to DSBs, perhaps due to their inappropriate processing. Chromosomal healing in human cells may or may not involve telomerase, and does not occur at interstitial DSBs in somatic cells [ It was long believed that the biological effects of IR exposure were solely the consequence of DNA damage that occurs in cells during or shortly after direct traversal of an IR particle through a cell nucleus. However, this classical \u201ctarget theory,\u201d which used to be the central paradigm of radiation biology, was challenged by two important discoveries: (1) genomic instability following cytoplasmic irradiation without direct nuclear traversal [ This section discusses what is currently known about telomeric and chromosomal damage induced by direct and indirect IR exposure, and how this may lead to genetic instability during proliferation. As it is well established that the chromosomal damage induced by IR triggers DDR pathways, and DDR proteins are closely linked with telomeric proteins and telomere maintenance, we ask how/if telomeres are affected after direct or indirect IR exposure and during subsequent proliferation. It is well known that the extent and complexity of biological damage induced by direct IR exposure is directly proportional to the radiation energy deposition patterns and linear energy transfer (LET), which is defined as the amount of energy lost per unit length along the path traveled by the radiation (expressed in keV \u03bcm The notion that DNA damage induced by direct IR (low- or high-LET) exposure can be transmitted to the progeny of directly irradiated cells to cause delayed genomic instability was first realized by Terzaghi and Little in 1976 [ Immediately following IR exposure of normal human cells, a selective process commences that selects against highly damaged cells; highly damaged cells harboring multiple complex chromo-some aberrations either die or do not give rise to viable progeny cells. Irradiated cells that are viable undergo a delay in the cell cycle to allow for repair of IR-induced DNA damage [ Transmissible mutations that can be propagated to progeny cells are believed to be fixed during DNA synthesis and cell proliferation, and unstable aberrations and those chromosomal lesions not compatible with cell survival are eliminated at subsequent cell divisions post-irradiation, decreasing by half at each cell generation [ Meanwhile, the discovery of \u201cnon-targeted radiation-induced bystander effects\u201d by Nagasawa and Little in 1992 [ Indeed, manifestations of non-targeted bystander effects (some harmful, others beneficial) are well described. It is well established that IR-induced bystander effects induce a spectrum of detrimental radiation damage in non-irradiated neighboring cells that are similar to those observed in directly irradiated cells [ As discussed in the preceding section, direct exposure to IR of high- or low-LET is well known to cause DNA damage, both from the direct traversal of the radiation particle itself or from radiation-induced physiological changes in the cell or tissue; these physiological changes are also seen in their progeny cells, as well as in their bystander cells and their progeny. Similarly, radiation damage of telomeres can also occur directly (via ionization events via direct traversal of IR within telomere sequences) or indirectly (via post-irradiation telomere uncapping and alterations in telomere maintenance mechanisms) [ Telomeres have been shown to be particularly sensitive to damage from oxygen species [ Additionally, telomeres have been shown to be hypersensitive to damage following ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, a type of nonionizing radiation. TT-CPDs on the G-strand were the most frequent dimer formed, and CC-CPDs and CT-CPDs were formed to a lesser extent on the C-strand [ Studies to determine the mechanisms for the transmission of IR-induced genomic damage during cell proliferation have highlighted its complexity. The fact that IR-induced genomic instability is transmitted through many generations after irradiation suggests that there may be a mechanism by which the effects of radiation exposure are preserved. Little is known about the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of genomic instability across multiple cell divisions in affected clonal populations; however, existing data strongly implicate heritable epigenetic deregulation [ Several different mechanisms for the propagation of IR-induced genomic instability have been proposed, including the transmission of nonlethal, potentially unstable chromosome regions (PUCR). It has been proposed that PUCRs are created via DDR mechanisms that convert the initial IR-induced DSBs to other types of structures in the genome, such as gross chromosomal rearrangements and large chromosome deletions. This suggested that chromosomal instability in late passage progeny of irradiated cells was correlated with telomere shortening associated with either cell divisions or telomere loss due to a DNA DSB occurring near the end of a chromosome [ Meanwhile, though manifestations of the bystander effect are well described, as discussed in Section 3.2, the mechanisms of propagation of the IR-induced stress signals from directly irradiated to bystander cells are not yet well characterized. Whether or not IR induces accelerated telomere shortening in normal human cells is important to consider, as it is associated with accelerated aging and telomere dysfunction. However, much conflicting data exist concerning the effect of IR on TL in normal human cells, especially with respect to the contributions of LET and bystander effects. A few studies suggest that the immediate effects of IR on TL in normal human cells are dose- and LET-dependent. At 24 and 48 h after in vitro irradiation with low doses in the range of 0.1\u20131 Gy, no changes in TL in normal human AG1522 fibroblasts were observed after either low- or high-LET irradiation [ A few studies of the long-term effects of IR on TL indicate that while normal human fibroblasts irradiated with 4 Gy of low-LET X-rays showed no changes in TL at 24 h post-irradiation, they exhibited significant telomere shortening at 4 days, followed by delayed telomere elongation at 15 days after irradiation. On the other hand, the equivalent dose of high-LET protons caused telomere lengthening shortly after irradiation as well as at longer harvesting times [ Concerning indirect IR exposure, not much is known of the short and long-term radiation-induced bystander effects on TL, despite the fact that manifestations of bystander-induced genetic instability are very well documented. higher doses do not induce more telomere shortening or stronger bystander effects), and there seems to be a dose threshold at which the bystander signal is not induced [ As the shelterin proteins are directly involved in maintaining TL, as discussed in previous sections, changes in TL after irradiation can be due to IR-induced changes in the shelterin proteins. However, little is known if and how IR affects shelterin protein levels. One study suggested that in vitro irradiation of normal human cells at clinical doses (18 to >40 Gy) induced a significant decrease in TPP1 and POT1, a slight decrease in TRF1 and TRF2, and no evident alterations in TIN2 and RAP1 [ Additionally, as TL is maintained by telomerase activity, whether IR itself induces up-regulation of telomerase activity is important to consider, especially in terms of radiotherapy. Indeed, IR-induced up-regulation of telomerase activity in cancer cells would enhance radioresistance in these cells during treatment, and would require the use of telomerase inhibitors during radiotherapy. IR exposure was shown to up-regulate telomerase in human hematopoietic and cancer cells [ In addition to the differences in biological effects as a function of radiation dose and quality in cancer radiotherapy, it is also important to consider inherent differences in sensitivity to IR. Indeed, it is well established that there is considerable variation in sensitivity to IR among both cancer patients and healthy individuals, and that radiation sensitivity can contribute significantly to the clinical outcomes of radiotherapy. Telomere shortening may cause increased radio-sensitivity by altering the kinetics of repair due to changes in chromatid structure that limits the access of DDR proteins; indeed, higher baseline levels of gamma-H2AX [ Overall, the many examples of conflicting data highlight the complexity of the relationships between IR, radiosensitivity, TL, telomerase activity, and DDR. At the present time, the existing data remain inconclusive, and the direct effects of IR on telomeres and their maintenance remain unclear. Indeed, as previously mentioned, there are inter-individual and intra-individual differences in TL; that is, TL varies among healthy individuals [ As humans are constantly exposed to IR via natural and/or man-made sources, it is important to study the immediate and long-term consequences of IR exposure, and the contribution of the bystander effect, on telomeres and telomere maintenance. Much work is still needed to confirm not only the fundamental effects of various types of IR on telomeres and telomere maintenance in normal human cells, but to determine if/ how telomeres play a role in the mechanisms of these direct and indirect radiation-induced effects (see Work in the laboratory has been supported by the European Community Seventh Framework (Euratom) Grants EpiRadBio and DoReMi.", "", "By immunohistochemistry (IHC), IGF-1R expression was significantly higher in tumor vs. normal tissues (p < 0.001) while IR expression showed no difference. Interestingly, 64% of tumors demonstrated high IR positivity in the vessels within or surrounding the tumor stroma, but not in the vessels away from the tumor. The preferential over-expression of IR in the peri-tumoral microvessels suggests that hyperinsulinemia might contribute to colorectal cancer growth by enhancing angiogenesis. Insulin resistance was defined as a homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) score At baseline, history and physical (H&P), MS-related parameters, ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), instrumental ADL, comorbidity, medications and Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric (CIRS-G) were recorded. The IGF-1R and IR stains were scored according to the Allred 8-unit system using the combination of a proportion score from 0 to 5 and an intensity score on a scale of 0 to 3. The expression levels of IGF-1R and IR in tumors were compared to those in normal tissues. By measurement of the total Allred score, IR was slightly over-expressed in normal tissue compared to tumor tissue (p = 0.05). There was a statistically significant IR over-expression in normal tissue in the non-MS group (p = 0.02), but not in the MS group (p = 0.54). The other key finding in our study relates to the demonstration of IR over-expression in the peri-tumoral vessels. Our study is limited by its small sample size, but despite the limited power of the study, hyperinsulinemia and IR expression alterations stood out and provided a potentially new molecular mechanism for CRC arising in patients with MS. Additional studies are in progress to further explore these processes. The preferential over-expression of IR in the peri-tumoral microvessels suggests that hyperinsulinemia might contribute to colon cancer growth by enhancing angiogenesis, in addition to its known proliferative effects. Endothelial cells in the non-tumor stroma show no or little IR staining (**).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a combined treatment with erythropoietin (EPO) plus melatonin (MEL), which are known anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents, in IR-induced renal injury in rats. Histological findings of the IR group indicated that there was increase in tubular and glomerular hyaline cast, thickening of Bowman capsule basement membrane, and renal impairment in the glomerular epithelium.", "Further details are provided in the Assays were performed to measure \u03b2-catenin activity using the TOPflash or FOPflash reporter constructs as we have described previously ( Cells with or without altered ATDC expression were cultured for 24 hours in 60 mm petri dishes and irradiated with varying doses of IR. The number of colonies with more than 50 cells was counted and the percentage of cell survival was calculated as the ratio of colonies in dishes exposed to IR compared to non-irradiated samples. Ionizing radiation is a treatment option frequently used to manage locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancers ( We next wanted to test if the radioprotective effect of ATDC was present in tumors To investigate whether ATDC knockdown in BxPC3 orthotopic xenografts increased sensitivity to IR, we used the same nanovector approach in combination with IR (ten 1 Gy fractions over 2 weeks). ATDC-targeting shRNA significantly reduced tumor growth and in combination with IR completely blocked tumor growth ( Following IR exposure, ATM is rapidly activated and phosphorylates over 700 substrates ( Since ATM did not directly phosphorylate ATDC in It has been reported that MAPKAP kinase-2 (MK2) kinase is a downstream target for p38 kinase in the DDR following treatment with chemotherapeutic agents ( To explore the contributions of phosphorylation at Ser550, Ser552 or both sites to the radioprotective function of ATDC, we utilized FLAG-tagged CMV expression vectors of the Ala substitution mutants at Ser-550(S550A), Ser-552(S552A) and Ser550/552(S550/552A). Activation of ATM kinase is a crucial initial step which occurs immediately after DNA damage induced by IR. Chk2 and p53 then facilitate the activation of G1/S or G2/M cell cycle arrest to allow DNA repair and restore genomic integrity prior to DNA replication and mitosis ( In this study, we show that following IR, the MK2 kinase is activated in an ATM-dependent manner. MK2 phosphorylates ATDC on Ser550, an evolutionary conserved site in the protein, which is crucial for the role of ATDC in the DDR after IR. Although ATDC lacks intrinsic kinase or enzymatic activity, it has been previously demonstrated to bind and sequester p53 in the cytoplasm, abrogating IR-induced p21 accumulation and blocking cell cycle arrest ( These actions identify ATDC as a global survival factor which aids in cellular survival and tolerance of DNA damage and cellular stress. Indeed, ATDC is normally expressed at high levels in tissues such as skin, which are subject to constant genotoxic insult by UV and IR and may thus provide a mechanism to allow these tissues to avoid premature or excessive cell death. However, when aberrantly expressed in tumor cells, this same mechanism induces cellular resistance to the DNA damaging agents commonly used to treat malignancy and may explain why malignancies such as pancreatic cancer with high levels of ATDC also demonstrate resistance to IR or chemotherapy. In this study, ATDC expression levels correlate with cellular resistance to IR both In summary, we have demonstrated that ATDC is a novel MK2 kinase substrate phosphorylated by MK2 in an ATM-dependent manner in response to DNA damage. Phosphorylation occurs on the evolutionary conserved site Ser-550, which is crucial for the role of ATDC in the DDR after IR ( This work was funded by NIH grant R01CA1311045 (D.M.S.) Tumor size was measured twice weekly (*p<0.05 vs. nano-cont shRNA + IR, n=8 animals/group). (B) At various times following IR (10 Gy), cell lysates of HEK 293 with or without ATDC expression were immunoprecipitated with Flag antibody and immunoblotted with a phospho-Ser/Thr antibody. (C) At various times following IR (10 Gy), cell lysates of HEK (A, B) One hour after pretreatment with AZD7762 (100 nM), KU55933 (20 \u03bcM) or SB203580 (50 \u03bcM), HEK293 (A) or BxPC3 (B) cells were exposed to IR (10 Gy) for 1 hour. (C) One hour after pretreatment with MK2 inhibitor (100 nM), BxPC3 cells were exposed to IR (10 Gy) for 1 hour. (D) (A) Apoptosis assays were performed in HEK293 cells expressing ATDC or ATDC(S550A), (S552A) and (S550/552A) mutants 24 hours after IR (10 Gy) (*p<0.05 vs vector).

(C) Apoptosis assays performed 24 hr after IR in HEK293 cells with and without ATDC transfected with control or MK2 shRNA (*p<0.05 HEK293 transfected with control shRNA with ATDC vs without ATDC, # p<0.05 HEK293 cells with ATDC- control vs MK2 shRNA). (D) Clonogenic survival assays 14 days after IR (5 Gy) using control or ATDC expressing HEK293 cells with or without MK2 shRNA (n=3, mean\u00b1SE, *p<0.05 HEK293 transfected with control shRNA with ATDC vs without ATDC, # p<0.05 HEK293 cells with ATDC- control vs MK2 shRNA). (F) After establishing Mia PaCa2 subcutaneous xenografts, mice were randomized and left untreated or treated with IR (1.5 Gy, 5 d/week for 3 weeks). 24 hours after reporter transfection, cells were irradiated (IR, 10 Gy), Five hours after irradiation, luciferase activity in cell lysates were assessed. Left: In the absence of IR, ATDC binds to stabilized Dvl2, bringing it to the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex (GSK3\u03b2-APC-Axin). Right: In the presence of IR, ATM is activated, resulting in MK2 kinase phosphorylation in a p38 kinase-dependent manner.", "SS reduced mRNA levels of IR 2 and IR 3 in adipose tissue; of IR1 and IR 4 in Brockmann bodies; of IR1, IR2, IR3, and IR4 in cardiac muscle; of IR2 and IR4 in liver; of IR 3 and IR 4 in gill; and of IR4 in skeletal muscle. SS decreased INS and IR mRNAs in both tissues in a concentration-, time-, and isoform/subtype-dependent manner. These results indicate that SS regulates the expression of INS- and IR-encoding mRNAs and that independent mechanisms may serve to regulate the various INS isoforms and IR subtypes.", "EPO reduced IR injury, increasing follicle survival and function in grafted ovaries.", "In this study, we hypothesized that the recurrence of IH might result in cellular and systemic inflammation, which was manifested through the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and adipokines after IH exposure, and because IR is linked with inflammation tightly, this inflammatory situation may implicate an IR status. Because IR and glucose intolerance are linked with inflammation tightly, our results may implicate the clinical relationships between OSA and IR. Circulating concentrations of leptin are proportional to the degree of IR In this study, we developed an IH 3T3-L1 adipocyte and rat model respectively, recapitulating the nocturnal oxygen profile in OSA. We hypothesized that the recurrence of IH and the following reoxygenation (ROX) might result in cellular and systemic inflammation, which was manifested through the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and adipokines after IH exposure, and because IR and glucose intolerance are linked with inflammation tightly according to widely accepted previous studies, this inflammatory situation may implicate an IR status through the levels of leptin, adiponectin and some other mediators indirectly in 3T3-L1 adipocyte culture medium and rat model and through blood glucose and insulin levels in rat plasma. Note: ROX, reoxygenation; PaO In cellular model, we collected the culture medium samples from about 1 mm above the cell layer and PO Note: Note: ROX, reoxygenation; PO Body weight of rats was different among groups after 8 weeks of exposure ( Insulin and blood glucose levels in rat plasma are presented in NF-\u03baB DNA binding reactions were significantly different among groups of cellular model after exposure ( Both the mRNA and protein levels of HIF-1\u03b1 were different statistically among cellular groups ( Both the mRNA and protein levels of Glut-1 were different statistically among cellular groups ( In cellular and animal models, both the mRNA and protein levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were different statistically among groups ( In cellular and animal models, both the mRNA and protein levels of leptin and adiponectin were different statistically among groups ( It has been suggested that there is a close association between inflammation and IR It is now generally accepted that white adipose tissue is a key endocrine and secretory organ which releases various adipokines with links to inflammation and immunity.", "IR also develops alongside muscle atrophy in older individuals in sarcopenic obesity. Deletion of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 family member myostatin, or sequestration of the active peptide by overexpression of the myostatin propeptide/latency-associated peptide (ProMyo) results in both muscle hypertrophy and reduced obesity and IR. Thus, myostatin inhibition has direct effects to enhance glucose disposal in muscle beyond that expected of hypertrophy alone, and this approach may offer potential for the therapy of IR syndromes. Myostatin is a member of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) family of secreted proteins that is almost exclusively expressed by skeletal muscle, and this tissue is also its principal target, where it inhibits myocyte hypertrophy ( As might be predicted, therefore, myostatin null and mutant mice also resist diet-induced obesity and IR ( Active myostatin is generated by cleavage of a precursor protein and subsequent dimerization. pY608-insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1 antibody was from Biosource International (Camarillo, CA), total IRS1, total glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3\u03b1/\u03b2, and GLUT1 antibodies from Millipore (Billerica, MA), caveolin-1 antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), actin and desmin antibodies from Sigma, and all others from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Effects of myostatin silencing on phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1, pY608) ( Because activation of the AMPK pathway provides an alternative stimulus for increased glucose disposal and AMPK phosphorylation and expression were reduced in myostatin null mice ( Local myostatin inhibition causes a reduction in activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway in skeletal muscle. Although IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) mRNA was not significantly altered, there was a small decrease in IGF-I expression (by 8%, In our study we have demonstrated that local inhibition of myostatin action in skeletal muscle for only a relatively short period is capable of generating both increased muscle mass and glucose disposal in rats.", "Since tumor cells neutralize ROS by utilizing reducing equivalents, we hypothesized that measurements of reducing potential using real-time hyperpolarized (HP) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) can serve as a surrogate marker of IR induced ROS.

Although IR exposed ATC tumors exhibited significantly slower growth rates, growth was not completely arrested. This would be consistent with data presented by Albers et al., which demonstrated that increased conversion corresponded to more aggressive solid tumor histology Improved IR effectiveness in controlling the growth of ATC and other aggressive solid tumors is an important clinical goal.

This would be consistent with data presented by Albers et al., which demonstrated that increased conversion corresponded to more aggressive solid tumor histology Improved IR effectiveness in controlling the growth of ATC and other aggressive solid tumors is an important clinical goal. Although investigators have been able to characterize IR effects", "When treated with limiting concentrations of doxycycline, ~20% of these cells coex-pressed GOLPH3 and GFP ( To test the role of phosphorylation of GOLPH3 in conferring a survival advantage, we compared cells that were transiently transfected with IRES-GFP constructs to express WT GOLPH3 (TQ-TVQ), unphosphorylatable GOLPH3 ( We next examined whether transient overexpression of GOLPH3 during DNA damage results in enhanced long-term cell survival, as measured by a clonogenic survival assay.

In addition, H460R cells were resistant to IR, exhibiting reduced expression levels of ionizing responsive proteins (p-p53 and \u03b3-H2AX); apoptosis-related molecules, such as cleaved poly(ADP ribose) polymerase; and endoplasmic reticulum stress-related molecules, such as glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) and C/EBP-homologous protein compared with parental cells, whereas the expression of anti-apoptotic X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein was increased. Among DEGs, syntrophin beta 2 (SNTB2) significantly increased in H460R cells in response to IR. Knockdown of SNTB2 by siRNA was more sensitive than the control after IR exposure in H460, H460R, and H1299 cells. Our study suggests that H460R cells have differential properties, including cell morphology, potential for metastasis, and resistance to IR, compared with parental cells. ATM stimulates IR-induced cycle arrest through activation of checkpoint kinases; p53; and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, such as p21 [ Syntrophins are intracellular peripheral membrane proteins of 58-60 kD, originally identified as proteins enriched at the postsynaptic apparatus [ In the present study, we established radioresistant NSCLC H460R cells. We tried to analyze these cells in response to IR to identify SNTB2 among upregulated genes in radioresistant H460R cells and to provide new insights into the involvement of SNTB2 in radioresistance. Radioresistance means the relative resistance of cells, tissues, organs, or organisms to the injurious effects of IR. In contrast, H460R cells exhibited a spindle-like morphology and demonstrated a loss of cell-to-cell contact and an increase in cell scattering, as well as acidic vesicular organelles ( Since spindle-like morphology and an increase in cell scattering were found in H460R cells ( It has been known that radioresistant cells have some characteristics, such as DNA repair and anti-apoptotic properties, in response to IR as well as other anticancer drugs [ A cDNA microarray was used to analyze DEGs in H460R cells in response to IR. Four hundred genes that were either up-regulated or down-regulated, demonstrating more than 2-fold changes in H460R cells, are categorized in Cancer cells often demonstrate resistance to IR, fail to arrest the cell cycle to repair DNA damage, and continue to proliferate under genotoxic stress [ In the present study, we established radioresistant NSCLC H460 cells by fractionated low-dose IR and evaluated their response to IR. Identification of DEGs related to DNA damage, cell growth, and ECM compared with parental cells in radioresistant lung cancer cells that have been developed by fractionated IR has been reported [ In this study, SNTB2 increased after IR exposure, and knockdown of SNTB2 led to an increase in sensitivity in both H460 and H460R cells in response to IR. H460R cells can be considered to be genetically more heterogeneous in response to repeated IR. Hence, we alternatively utilized IR-resistant H1299 cells to confirm that SNTB2 is involved in radioresistance. H1299 cells, which express endogenously high SNTB2 levels and are radioresistant, were more sensitive to IR exposure when SNTB2 was down-regulated by siRNA. In summary, we established H460R-radioresistant cells by fractionated low-dose IR and showed that these cells exhibit not only morphological changes but also a differential response to IR at the molecular level compared with parental cells.

We show that, like IRS-1, the region of IRS-2 that contains the putative phosphotyrosine binding and SAIN elements (188-591) is sufficient for receptor interaction and that this interaction is dependent upon the NPX(p)Y (where (p)Y is phosphotyrosine) motifs within the juxtamembrane domains of the receptors. In addition to this amino-terminal NPX(p)Y-binding domain, an additional domain of strong interaction was identified in the central region of IRS-2 and was localized between amino acids 591 and 733. Both of the interactions could also be demonstrated in vitro using IRS-2 glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. We conclude that IRS-2, unlike IRS-1, can interact with tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors such as the IR and insulin-like growth factor I receptor via multiple independent binding motifs. Our findings suggest the existence of a previously unidentified phosphotyrosine-dependent binding domain within the central region of IRS-2.", "Glycogen synthesis rates during the initial insulin independent portion (0-1 hr of recovery) were similar in the two groups (IR, 15.5 +/- 1.3 mM/hr and CON, 15.8 +/- 1.7 mM/hr); however, over the next 4 hr, insulin-dependent glycogen synthesis was significantly reduced in the IR group [IR, 0.1 +/- 0.5 mM/hr and CON, 2.9 +/- 0.2 mM/hr; (P < or = 0.001)]. In summary, we found that following muscle glycogen-depleting exercise, IR offspring of parents with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus had (i) normal rates of muscle glycogen synthesis during the insulin-independent phase of recovery from exercise and (ii) severely diminished rates of muscle glycogen synthesis during the subsequent recovery period (2-5 hr), which has previously been shown to be insulin-dependent in normal CON subjects. These data provide evidence that exercise and insulin stimulate muscle glycogen synthesis in humans by different mechanisms and that in the IR subjects the early response to stimulation by exercise is normal.", "Both the insulin and IGF-I receptors (IGF-IR) are overexpressed in breast cancer, and antibody blockade of the IGF-IR inhibits the growth of some breast cancer cell lines. In this paper, we investigated whether inactivation of p53 might be involved in the overexpression of the IR in malignancy, specifically breast cancer. We demonstrate a positive correlation between IR and IGF-IR levels and p53 overexpression in primary human breast malignancies. To examine possible mechanisms by which p53 may regulate IR gene expression, we show that p53 can repress the IR promoter and that a dominant-negative p53 (248Q) can de-repress the promoter in cells containing normal p53. These results suggest that p53 inactivation may lead to an up-regulation of genes, such as the IR, that are dependent on these transcription factors.", "However, the receptors and the signaling pathway used by TNF-alpha that mediate the inhibition of IR activity are unknown. We show here that human TNF-alpha, which binds only to the murine p55 TNF receptor (TNFR), is as effective at inhibiting insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1 in adipocytes and myeloid 32D cells as murine TNF-alpha, which binds to both p55 TNFR and p75 TNFR. Exogenous sphingomyelinase and ceramides, known to be formed by activation of p55 TNFR, inhibit IR and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and convert IRS-1 into an inhibitor of IR tyrosine kinase in vitro. Myeloid 32D cells expressing IR and IRS-1 are sensitive to this inhibition, but cells expressing IR and IRS-2 are resistant, pointing to an important difference in the biological function between IRS-1 and IRS-2. These data strongly suggest that TNF-alpha inhibits insulin signaling via stimulation of p55 TNFR and sphingomyelinase activity, which results in the production of an inhibitory form of IRS-1.", "The cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor, p21Waf-1 was modified differently between the two cancer cell types, whereas p53 protein was induced in a similar manner after IR or UV treatment. IR steadily induced p21Waf-1 protein in HEp-2 cells, but not in HeLa cells. Furthermore, overexpression of p21Waf-1 protein in these cells by transient transfection and in stable cell lines in a tetracycline-regulated system, rescued IR- and UV-induced apoptosis. We concluded that p21Waf-1 protein is modified independently of p53 and functions as an inhibitor of IR- as well as UV-induced apoptosis in squamous carcinoma cells.", "After rats were fed a protein-free diet (PF) or a 12% casein diet for 1 week, their IR and IRS-1 states were analyzed by immunoblotting using various antibodies. PF slightly increased the amount of IR without affecting the state of IR tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, PF decreased the amount of IRS-1 and markedly increased phosphorylation of IRS-1 tyrosine residues after insulin injection. Moreover, IRS-1 in PF rats exhibited faster mobility in SDS-PAGE as well as far less phosphorylation of Ser612 and Ser307, indicating hypophosphorylation on its serine residues. Results of additional experiments using energy-restricted (pair-fed) rats and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats suggest that dietary protein deficiency by itself alters serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, while the up-regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation requires other factors, such as a reduction in basal plasma insulin. The serine dephosphorylation followed by up-regulation of insulin-dependent IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in skeletal muscle of PF rats in vivo is similar to a phenomenon observed in cultured cells under restriction of amino acids in the medium. With these findings, it could be inferred that the reduction of serine phosphorylation contributes to the sensitization of IRS-1 to IR tyrosine kinase under protein malnutrition.", "BADGP reversed the glucosamine-induced reduction in insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IR, IRS-1, IRS-2, Akt, GSK-3, and FOXO1a. Increased routing of glucose through this metabolic pathway results in impaired activation of the IR/IRSs/PI3-kinase/Akt survival pathway by induction of O-glycosylation of signaling molecules.", "Additionally, we show that inactivation of both DNA-PK and ATM is required to ablate IR-induced H2AX phosphorylation in chicken cells. Taken together, we conclude that under most normal growth conditions, IR-induced H2AX phosphorylation can be carried out by ATM and DNA-PK in a redundant, overlapping manner.", "In fact, p53-deficient mice survive doses of IR that cause lethal hematopoietic syndrome in wild-type animals. Surprisingly, p53 deficiency results in sensitization of mice to higher doses of IR, causing lethal gastro-intestinal (GI) syndrome. p21-deficient mice are also characterized by increased sensitivity to GI syndrome-inducing doses of IR. We conclude that p53/p21-mediated growth arrest plays a protective role in the epithelium of small intestine after severe doses of IR.", "IR-induced phosphorylation of CREB correlated with a decrease in CREB transactivation potential and reduced interaction between CREB and its transcriptional coactivator, CREB-binding protein (CBP). A CREB mutant containing Ala substitutions at ATM phosphorylation sites displayed enhanced transactivation potential, resistance to inhibition by IR, and increased binding to CBP.", "ITT is a simple, reasonably accurate and rapid method for screening IR (). As reported earlier () IR or insulin deficiency is associated with hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Insulin deficiency or IR may be responsible for dyslipidemia, because insulin has an inhibitory action on HMG-COA reductase, a key rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the metabolism of cholesterol rich LDL particles. proposed that IR in diabetic (or non diabetic) subjects led to compensatory hyperinsulinemia, which is associated with, increased LDL and reduced HDL concentrations.", "It was previously shown that heat shock, as well as NSAIDs, inhibits IR-induced activation of NF-kappaB and that NF-kappaB protects against IR-induced cytotoxicity. HeLa cells pretreated with indomethacin showed a decrease in the temperature-time combination necessary to inhibit IR-induction of NF-kappaB DNA binding. Interestingly, no additional cell killing was observed when heat shock was added to cells treated with TPCK before IR, suggesting a possible common cytotoxic pathway.", "Moreover, while the N terminus of NBS1 was essential for IR-induced NBS1 focus formation, it was dispensable for the localization of NBS1 to sites of UV-induced damage (C) (). Moreover, ATLD cells were sensitive to IR but not UV, although UV sensitivity was considerably enhanced when NBS1 was depleted with siRNA (J). Furthermore, both NBS1 mutants lacking the MRE11-binding domain and MRE11-deficient ATLD cells were not sensitive to UV, although ATLD cells were sensitive to IR (E and J).", "One possible candidate is lysosomal lipase (LIPA) [ We hypothesized that steatosis-associated hepatic IR is causally linked with alteration of endogenous TAG degradation in NAFLD. To address this issue, the activity of LIPA and the production of TAG breakdown intermediates were determined in animals with normal insulin sensitivity and with hepatic IR induced by a two-week administration of a high-fat diet. We identified the steatosis-associated changes in the regulation of LIPA activity based on the alteration in its intracellular distribution, and we proposed the mechanism by which it can contribute to the establishment of hepatic IR. As shown in Determination of the relative abundance of the particular PKC isoform in the membrane and cytosol fractions reflects PKC In the present study, we provide evidence that in steatosis the increased degradation of TAG mediated by LIPA and associated with the increased production of DAG may be one of the mechanisms determining the rapid onset of hepatic IR.

IR was measured before treatment and 12 weeks after treatment using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-IR. Paired HOMA-IR measurements were available in 1038 non-diabetic patients (497 with genotype 1; 541 with genotype 2/3). At baseline the prevalence of HOMA-IR >3 was greater in patients with genotype 1 than 2/3 (33% vs 27%; p=0.048). There was a significant reduction in the prevalence of IR in patients with genotype 1 achieving SVR (\u03b4 10%; p<0.001), but not in genotype 1 non-responders or those with genotype 2/3. Multivariate analysis indicated that SVR was associated with a significant reduction in mean HOMA-IR in patients with genotype 1 (p=0.004), but not in those with genotype 2/3, which was independent of body mass index, alanine transaminase, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase and lipid level changes. SVR is associated with a reduction in HOMA-IR in patients with HCV genotype 1 but not in those with genotype 2/3. Genotype 1 may have a direct effect on the development of IR, independent of host metabolic factors, and may be partially reversed by viral eradication. In a recent large cross-sectional French study, IR was associated with HCV genotype (Gt) 1/4 and high viral load. Furthermore, HCV Gt 1 has been implicated in the development of both IR and type 2 diabetes. The aim of the present study was to explore the potential causal role of HCV in the development of IR by evaluating the association between SVR and IR in a large well-characterised cohort of patients with chronic HCV. The relationships between viral clearance and lipid parameters and between baseline IR and hepatic fibrosis stage were also assessed. IR was measured in fasting serum samples using homeostasis model assessment-IR (HOMA-IR), calculated as fasting insulin (\u03bcU/ml) \u00d7 fasting glucose (mmol/l)/22.5. Baseline liver biopsies were centrally evaluated for METAVIR fibrosis stage, METAVIR inflammatory activity and hepatic steatosis grade by a single expert histopathologist who was blinded to all clinical and laboratory data. Clinically significant fibrosis was classified as METAVIR stage F2\u20134. The characteristics of the study population are shown in IR, defined by HOMA-IR >3, was present in 308 patients (30%). Patients with IR were mostly older Caucasian men with an elevated BMI ( HOMA-IR was also considered as a continuous variable. HCV Gt was associated with a difference in HOMA-IR levels on univariable analysis (median 2.3 (range 1.4\u20133.5) vs 1.9 (1.3\u20133.2), p=0.006, There was no difference in the prevalence of IR (HOMA-IR >3) or median HOMA-IR score between patients with Gt 2 HCV and those with Gt 3 HCV. The analysis of the effect of viral clearance on IR therefore compared Gt 1 with Gt 2/3 HCV. For analysis of the potential impact of viral clearance on IR, the ACHIEVE-1 and ACHIEVE-2/3 cohorts were considered separately due to the differential association between SVR and IR across HCV Gt (interaction p=0.02). First, it was considered whether viral clearance was associated with a reduction in the number of patients with HOMA-IR >3. In the setting of Gt 1, SVR (n=300) was associated with a reduction from baseline in the prevalence of IR from 29% to 19% (p<0.001). In contrast, no significant change in IR was detected in Gt 1 non-responders (n=197; To investigate the relationship between viral clearance and change in HOMA-IR, HOMA-IR was considered as a continuous variable. In patients with HCV Gt 1, SVR was associated with a significant reduction in mean HOMA-IR 12 weeks after treatment (p=0.004; Many patients treated with IFN-based therapy report weight loss, potentially confounding analyses relating to metabolic factors. The change in HOMA-IR (post-therapy \u2013 pre-therapy) was therefore modelled considering the following predictors: SVR and changes in BMI, ALT, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and fasting lipids (total cholesterol and triglycerides). Treatment regimen (peginterferon vs albinterferon) was not associated with change in IR. In the HCV Gt 1 cohort, HOMA-IR reduction was independently associated with SVR as well as reductions in BMI, serum GGT and serum triglyceride levels ( In patients with HCV Gt 1 and 2/3, SVR was associated with a significant increase in both total cholesterol and triglyceride levels which was independent of change in BMI ( Significant hepatic fibrosis (METAVIR F2\u20134) was present in 173 patients (17%). Significant fibrosis was also associated with IR, elevated serum ALT, lower serum total cholesterol levels, hepatic steatosis and moderate to severe hepatic inflammation (METAVIR activity A2\u20133). By logistic regression, significant fibrosis was independently associated with age >40 years, HOMA-IR >3 and moderate to severe necroinflammation ( In this well-characterised clinical trial cohort of patients with chronic HCV, SVR was independently associated with a reduction in IR in patients with HCV Gt 1 but not Gt 2/3. To date, this is the largest study to examine the Gt-specific effects of virological response on IR, and the results suggest a causal relationship between Gt 1 and IR. The prevalence of IR (HOMA-IR >3) in these non-diabetic patients with chronic HCV was higher with Gt 1 HCV than with Gt 2/3. Although neither Gt nor HCV viral load were observed to be independently associated with HOMA-IR >3, Gt 1 HCV was independently associated with higher HOMA-IR level when considered as a continuous variable (p=0.04). We note that the contribution of viral Gt to the final linear regression model was not great, however, being responsible for only 3% of the variability in HOMA-IR. BMI was the major contributor to HOMA-IR level in both models. More convincingly, in Gt 1 HCV, viral clearance was associated with a decreased frequency of IR as well as a reduction in quantitative HOMA-IR. Linear regression modelling confirmed that the association between IR and SVR was independent of change in BMI. The results therefore suggest a causal relationship between Gt 1 and IR that was reversed with successful antiviral therapy. Several small studies have previously described a relationship between viral suppression or clearance and improvement in IR in patients with chronic HCV. Romero-Gomez and colleagues The pathogenesis of HCV-mediated IR remains poorly understood. The HCV core protein has been associated with decreased expression of IRS-1/2 in vitro by increasing levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling-3, which then promotes proteasomal degradation of IRS-1/2. All patients with Gt 1 HCV should be screened for the presence of IR. Improvement of IR with Gt 1 HCV eradication may be an additional benefit of antiviral therapy, potentially reducing the risk of incident glucose abnormalities and related metabolic morbidity In conclusion, this study found that successful eradication of HCV Gt 1 was associated with reduced IR, suggesting a direct viral aetiology.

CHC has been associated with IR, with cross-sectional data suggesting that this association may be HCV genotype-specific. The impact of HCV clearance on IR in vivo has not been defined, and therefore a causal relationship between HCV infection and IR has not been confirmed. IR was more common in patients with genotype 1 HCV than in those with genotype 2/3 HCV. Viral eradication was associated with a reduction in IR in patients infected with genotype 1 but not in those with genotype 2/3 HCV, suggesting a causal relationship between genotype 1 HCV and IR in vivo. Patients with genotype 1 CHC should be tested for IR. Improvement of IR with eradication of genotype 1 HCV may be an additional benefit of antiviral therapy, contributing to long-term improvements of liver-related morbidity and mortality and reducing the risk of incident diabetes and related morbidity.", "Significantly changed IR-responsive microRNAs were selected based on analysis of variance analysis, and predicted target mRNAs were enriched in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. IR in miR-26b overexpressed H1299 cells could not induce expression of ATF2. From these results, we concluded that IR-induced up-regulation of ATF2 was coordinately enhanced by suppression of miR-26b in lung cancer cells, which may enhance the effect of IR in the MAPK signaling pathway. The microRNAs miR-7, miR-4, miR-79, miR-2, and miR-11 are involved in Notch signaling pathways by targeting the regulatory sequence motifs in the 3\u2032 UTR of target genes To understand posttranscriptional control of cellular responses to IR by microRNAs, the genome-wide expression profile of microRNA was examined in H1299 human lung cancer cells at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after treatment with 2Gy of \u03b3-radiation. The microRNA expression profile was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to select IR-responsive microRNAs. A list of all microRNAs is available in To explore the physiological meaning of IR-responsive microRNA, we listed predicted target mRNAs of IR-responsive microRNAs and the enriched signaling pathways were selected based on enrichment and statistical analysis of predicted target mRNA by DIANA-microT-3.0. Among the listed signaling pathways, we focused on the top 10 pathways based on the statistical significance ( * To validate regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway by IR-responsive microRNAs, we meta-analyzed mRNA expression profiles of the same \u03b3-irradiated H1299 cells from our published datasets We validated the expression patterns of IR-responsive microRNAs and target mRNAs for the MAPK signaling pathway. Down-regulated IR-responsive microRNAs may augment the function of target mRNAs. To test the relationship between down-regulated IR-responsive microRNAs and target mRNAs, we selected the pair of ATF2 and miR-26b among 35 pairs to demonstrate coordinated regulation between microRNAs and target mRNAs upon IR exposure. (C) The relative expression of ATF2 in miR-26b transfected and IR exposed cells at 4 (white), 8 (grey) and 12 (black) hours respectively. Treatment with SP600125 did not change the basal expression level of ATF2; however, induction of ATF2 upon \u03b3-irradiation was markedly blocked in SP600125-treated H1299 cells until 12 hours after IR exposure ( H1299 and A549 cells were treated with 10 \u00b5M SP600125 for 30 minutes, and then exposed to IR. IR can induce progressive changes in cell survival, growth, and proliferation by affecting gene expression. The transcriptional control of host CTDSP1 mRNA is not fully understood, but many putative binding sites exist for transcription factors such as CREB in ENCODE Transcription Factor Binding Analysis Deregulation of the MAPK signaling pathway can be induced by IR-induced DNA damage H1299 human lung cancer cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 and A549 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine [both cell lines were purchased from ATCC]. H1299 cells were incubated with 10 \u00b5M SP600125 for 30 min, and then exposed to IR (2 Gy) followed by total RNA isolation at indicated times.", "Herein, it is demonstrated that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors rapamycin (sirolimus) and temsirolimus limit both hormone therapy (HT)-sensitive and castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) cell proliferation as single agents and have a profound radiosensitization effect when used in combination with IR. Survival analyses revealed that mTOR inhibitors sensitized both HT-sensitive PCa and CRPC cells to IR at clinically attainable doses. LNCaP, C4-2, and LAPC4 cells were cultured under standard conditions at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO A Panatek orthovoltage X-ray irradiator was used to deliver IR. Cells were diluted serially to appropriate concentrations and plated into 50 ml tissue culture flasks in triplicate for 24 h. Then, cells were treated with increasing doses of IR (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 Gy). It has been demonstrated that in this cell type, androgens induce mTOR signaling that culminates in cell cycle progression via an increased translation of cyclin D1 ( While IR is a frequently used treatment modality for locally advanced disease, there is a 10\u201360% recurrence rate ( In addition to being used as a therapy for localized disease, IR is also used for local recurrence and metastases, when the cells have frequently become resistant to HT (CRPC cells). In the presence of androgens, mTOR inhibition sensitizes CRPC cells to IR ( To examine the relative cell cycle distribution of cells in each of the treatment schedules prior to irradiation, the amount of DNA in cell populations was determined by flow cytometry. Both Rapa and Tem when used in combination with IR significantly decrease clonogenic cell survival in HT-sensitive ( This study identifies mTOR inhibition as a therapeutic approach that, when combined with IR, suppresses cancer cell growth. While both IR and the two mTOR inhibitors tested (Rapa and Tem) showed single-agent efficacy in limiting PCa cell doubling at clinically relevant doses ( Despite the approved use of mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of renal clear cell carcinoma (RCC), there are few data regarding the impact of mTOR as a therapeutic target in PCa. Recently, it was demonstrated that mTOR is directly involved in the repair of DNA damage with respect to double-strand breaks, which occur frequently in cells exposed to IR ( In summary, the studies presented herein demonstrate that mTOR inhibitors exhibit schedule-dependent effects on the RT response in PCa cells and confer significant radiosensitization effects when used in the adjuvant setting. As depicted, cells were seeded 72 h prior to final treatment, mTOR inhibitors, IR, or combination thereof were administered concurrently (Schedule I; set as time \u20180\u2019), drug was washed out 24 h later, and cell number was assessed 168 h after treatment. Cell survival in the untreated control was set to 100%; averages of three independent experiments and mTOR inhibitors sensitize CRPC cells to the effects of irradiation (A) C4-2 cells were treated as in mTOR inhibitor-induced radiosensitization is a function of relative cell cycle inhibitory effect based on scheduling (A) Left panels: representative flow cytometry traces for each treatment Schedule that LNCaP cells were subjected to as depicted in Clonogenic cell survival of both hormone therapy-sensitive and CRPC cells is reduced with mTOR inhibition following IR (A) LNCaP cells were serially diluted to appropriate concentrations and seeded in 50 ml tissue culture flasks. 24 h later, cells were exposed to indicated doses of IR.", "Our aim was to investigate the effect of curcumin (CUM) on the healing of deep excision wound of mice exposed to fractionated IR by mimicking clinical conditions. Fractionated IR caused a dose-dependent delay in the wound contraction and prolonged wound healing time, whereas CUM administration before fractionated IR caused a significant elevation in the wound contraction and reduced mean wound healing time. Fractionated IR reduced the synthesis of collagen, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and nitric oxide (NO) at different post-IR times and treatment of mice with CUM before IR elevated the synthesis of collagen, DNA and NO significantly. Histological examination showed a reduction in the collagen deposition, fibroblast and vascular densities after fractionated IR, whereas CUM pre-treatment inhibited this decline significantly.", "Oxygen consumption (VO In order to evaluate the lifespan of Since the In order to determine whether the suppression of IR signaling impairs glucose metabolism in aged male and female mice, we measured the blood glucose ( In order to determine the physiological compensation for the mutation of the IR gene, we assessed the glucose and insulin tolerances of In the previous study, we showed a reduction of perigonadal adipose tissues in Since osteoblasts and adipocytes are differentiated from common progenitor cells in the bone marrow [ Since dietary restriction can prolong the lifespan of animals [ A relationship between low body temperature and lifespan has been reported in long-lived Ames dwarf mice and rhesus monkeys on dietary restriction [ Bluher et al. reported that specific deletion of the IR gene in adipose tissues extended the lifespan of FIRKO mice [ First, the reduced fat mass in It is unclear whether the IR or IGF-1R corresponds to the function of Kurosu et al. reported that mice with mutations in Long-lived nematode and fly mutants with altered insulin signaling generally acquire enhanced resistance to oxidative stress [ Mutations in the IR gene cause insulin resistance syndromes, such as leprehaunism, Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, and type A insulin resistance [ Kido et al. reported that genetic modifiers of insulin resistance influence the phenotype in IR-deficient mice [ In the present study, we showed that The authors thank Ms. Eiko Moriizumi for the histological analysis and measurement of body weight.", "While peripheral tissues contain different proportions of both isoforms, hepatic cells almost exclusively contain IR-B. In this respect, IR-B-selective insulin analogs would be of great interest for their potential to restore more natural metabolic homeostasis in diabetes. Recent advances in the structural biology of insulin and IR have provided new clues for understanding the interaction of both proteins. This article discusses and offers some structural perspectives for the design of specific insulin analogs with a preferential binding to IR-B. administered human insulin is cleared from the circulation in less than 2 h. It is important to mention, that both rapid-acting and slow-lasting analogs owe their properties primarily to their structural features or additives in their formulations, which determine their release to the circulation as active monomers rather than to different kinetics of interaction of their monomers with the insulin receptors (IRs) ( If administered orally, insulin as a protein hormone is rapidly degraded in the digestive track. Hence, despite intensive efforts to develop strategies for oral insulin administration [e.g., in 2013, Novo Nordisk A/S announced an investment of up to 3.7 billion dollars for the development of an insulin pill by 2020, Insulin elicits its functions through binding to the IR, which exists in two isoforms, IR-A and IR-B, resulting from the alternative splicing of the IR gene. The only difference between the isoforms is the 12-amino acid insert (IR-B plus and IR-A minus 12 amino acids) at the C-terminus of the extracellular \u03b1-subunit, called the \u03b1CT peptide. This differential sequence, which represents only a small fragment of IR (1,380 amino acids in total), has a relatively subtle impact on ligand binding and intracellular signaling, but which may nevertheless have important physiological consequences. Both isoforms have different tissue distribution with the longer IR-B being the largely predominant form in adult humans in hepatocytes (more than 90%), skeletal muscle and subcutaneous fat (both about 70% IR-B) ( Insulin and similar insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 (IGF-1 and IGF-2), together with their receptors, IR-A, IR-B and the receptor for IGF-1 (IGF-1R), form a complex system which plays a major role in the regulation of basal metabolism, growth, development, healing, lifespan ( Typical values of binding affinities ( Binding of insulin and IGFs to IR-A, IR-B, and IGF-1R receptors initiates autophosphorylation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK) domains of the receptors. The molecular mechanism of the signal transduction from extracellular hormone-binding domains to intracellular TKs is still unclear and represents a paradigm of signaling through a TK-like family of receptors ( Another interesting study ( Historically, IR-B is considered as a \u201cmetabolic\u201d form of IR, while mainly \u201cmitogenic\u201d effects are attributed to IR-A. Interestingly, IGF-1 in the complex with IR L1 domain, and the IGF-1R \u03b1CT peptide ( An overlay of receptor-bound structures of IGF-1 and insulin. The hybrid receptor is represented here by the Site 1 fragment composed of L1- and CR-domains of IR and \u03b1CT peptide of IGF-1R. The receptor fragment is the same as shown in Figure An important aspect of the structures shown in Figures The cartoon showing putative mutual arrangement and positioning of the IGF-1 C domain and C-terminal \u03b1CT-B residues on the IR-B receptor. A specific interaction of insulin analogs with the 12-amino acid \u03b1CT-B segment could possibly represent the keystone for the development of IR-B selective insulins. However, advances in these efforts are hampered by the lack of any structural data indicating the position of IR-B in the complexes. The Novo Nordisk A/S research group presented the first attempts at designing IR-B selective insulin analogs in 2011 ( Interestingly, Novo Nordisk research team recently published an elegant mutagenesis study ( We recently published the binding affinities of AsnB26-insulin, which has moderately altered binding specificity in favor of IR-B (1.7-fold), while still having native binding affinity (140% for IR-B) ( An overlay of the structures of receptor-bound insulin, AsnB26-insulin, and insulin analog with a triazole linker between position B26 and B29. Recently, we prepared a series of insulin analogs having the C-terminus of the A chain prolonged with D domains of IGF-1 or IGF-2 ( We are aware of only one published example of a significantly IR-A selective insulin analog; GlnA18-desThrB30-insulin with A1 and B29 residues connected by VGLSSGQ sequence. This single chain analog, reminiscent of proinsulin or IGFs, has 55% binding affinity for IR-A and 10% binding affinity for IR-B ( The Novo Nordisk team ( Finally, the fundamental question is whether it is technically feasible to modify human insulin in a way which will result in it being highly IR-isoform-selective (e.g., with IR-B/IR-A or IR-A/IR-B binding affinity ratio of 100 or more), or whether the selectivity of the currently available analogs has already reached its maximum. Firstly, we do not believe that such hypothetical high binding selectivity (>100) can be reached only by enhancing binding affinity of an analog for IR-B while maintaining near-wild-type affinity for IR-A.", "Control group: mice were received daily intraperitoneal injection of 0.2mL solution of 6% ethanol and 6% Tween 80; Cur group: mice were received daily intraperitoneal injection of 0.2mL curcumin at dose of 25mg/kg/d; IR group: mice were daily received intraperitoneal injection of 0.2mL solution of 6% ethanol and 6% Tween 80, from the third day, 2Gy of X-ray per day was employed to irradiate the tumors for 5 consecutive days. Cur+IR group: mice were daily received intraperitoneal injection of 0.2mL curcumin at dose of 25mg/kg/d, from the third day, 2Gy of X-ray per day was employed to irradiate the tumors for 5 consecutive days. Colon formation assay showed that the volume of colon formation in Cur+IR group was significantly reduced when compared to those only treated with curcumin or IR ( A). Furthermore, the cell survival curve revealed that with the exposure doses of X-ray increased, the survival rates in Cur+IR group were remarkably decreased ( 0.05) in comparison to those with IR treatment alone (B). In addition, according to the SHMT radiobiological model SF=1-(1-e), the radiation biology parameters showed that compared to IR treatment alone, the value of D, D, and SF was obviously decreased in Cur+IR group. To determine the effect of Cur and IR on the expression of pH2AX, a marker for DNA damage, confocal microscopy observation showed that after Cur or IR treatment, pH2AX foci was significantly increased when compared to control group ( 0.05, respectively; A), whereas, the number of green foci in Cur treatment alone group was much higher than that in IR treatment alone group. Furthermore, the pH2AX foci level was remarkably enhanced in combination with Cur and IR treatment as compared with IR alone ( 0.05). In addition, we also found that the induction of DNA repair regular DNA-PKcs and ATM expressions by IR were also remarkably inhibited by curcumin treatment in ACHN cells (<0.05; B).These data suggested that curcumin-mediated radiosensitization involves an inhibition of IR-induced DNA damage repair. Flow cytometry assay showed that curcumin or IR treatment alone significantly induced G2/M cell cycle arrest ( 0.05, respectively). And the percentage of G2/M phase cells was significantly enhanced (<0.05), while the percentage of S phase cells was dramatically reduced ( 0.05) with the combination treatment of curcumin and IR when compared to that of cells treatment with IR alone ( A). In addition, compared with control group, the rate of cell apoptosis was significantly increased in ACHN cells pretreated with curcumin (10\u03bcmol/L) or 4Gy of IR ( 0.05, respectively). The rate of apoptotic cellstreated with the combination of curcumin and IR was significant higher than that of IR alone ( 0.05, B). As showed in A, curcumin suppressed IR-induced NF-\u03baB signaling by significantly inhibiting the expression of NF-\u03baBP65 and promoting the expression of I-\u03baB (<0.05, respectively). Furthermore, the expression levels of NF-\u03baB downstream regulatory proteins, including VEGF, COX2, and Bcl-2 were obviously suppressed by curcumin in combination with IR treatment in ACHN cells (all 0.05 vs. IR group).To further demonstrate that curcumin exerts radiosensitivity on RCC was through suppressing NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, a selective NF-\u03baB inhibitor PDTC was used to inhibit the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Western blot results demonstrated that PDTC or curcumin treatment alone significantly inhibited the IR-induced activation of NF-\u03baB signaling by suppressing NF-\u03baBP65 expression and increasing I-\u03baB expression (all 0.05; B). The IR-induced activation of NF-\u03baB signaling was further inhibited by PDTC and curcumin co-treatment when compared to PDTC or curcumin treatment alone group (all 0.05). When combined with curcumin and PDTC treatment in IR-pretreated cells, the cell viability rate was even more reduced than curcumin administration alone ( 0.05). Whereas, combination with IR and curcumin treatment significantly suppressed tumor volume and tumor growth in nude mice, compared to those in IR or curcumin treatment alone group (B and C). Moreover, the combined treatment of IR and curcumin resulted in tumor growth inhibition of 71.42% on day 13 in comparison to that in curcumin (7.93%) or IR (49.20%) treatment alone group ( 0.05). The results showed that curcumin significantly reinforced IR-induced cell apoptosis ( 0.05), while decreased IR-induced expression of NF-\u03baB signaling related proteins in ACHN xenografts (all 0.05, D and E), which was consistent with observations. Furthermore, xenograft assay also confirmed that curcumin treatment also reinforced the suppression role of IR on RCC tumor growth . In the present study, the IR-survival curve of ACHN cells using a SHMT model formula illustrated that the IR biology parameters including N, D, D values of ACHN cells were significantly reduced after combination treated with curcumin and IR. The decreased D values indicated that curcumin enhanced the radiosensitivity effect and reduced the repair ability of ACHN cells to IR. While the decreased D value indicated that a related lower concentrations of IR could eliminate cancer cells when treated with curcumin. DNA repair pathway is the main mechanisms for radiotherapeutic resistance during IR treatment. Cellular exposure to IR results in the induction of double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in DNA, which leads to the failure of cell division and mitosis . Thus, pH2AX is always considered as a DSB marker to evaluate the DNA damage caused by IR treatment . To find whether curcumin could enhance the sensitivity of ACNH cells to IR by inducing DNA damage, the number of pH2AX foci in different pre-treated ACHN cells was estimated. Results revealed an increased in the expression of green foci was found in irradiated ACHN cells with curcumin treatment when compared to IR treatment alone. In addition, in response to reduce the IR-induced cell death, the damaged tumor cells also activate DNA damage response pathway through upregulation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA- PKcs), which are unfavorable to the use of radiation in cancer treatment. Our findings confirmed that the suppression of IR-induced DNA-PKcs and ATM expressions by curcumin was a promising approach to enhance the tumor cell killing effects of IR treatment. The alternation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis are considered as the common reactions in the response to IR treatment in tumor cells . Previous data have suggested that the tumor cells arrested in the G2/M phases are much more sensitive to IR than in other phases, which may result from the loss of ability to repair DNA damage . These data indicated that curcumin enhanced radiosensitivity by increasing the IR-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in ACHN cells. has demonstrated that curcumin sensitizes liver cancer cells to IR by inhibition of IR-induced NF-\u03baB activity . In our study, we demonstrated that in ACHN cells, curcumin inhibited IR-induced NF-\u03baB signaling pathways and this could contribute to the suppression of proliferation and induction of apoptosis by up-regulating I-\u03baB and down-regulating NF-\u03baB expressions both and . In addition, treatment with curcumin inhibited the IR-induced expressions of the NF-\u03baB downstream products COX2, Bcl-2 and VEGF in ACHN cells, which are required for cell proliferation, apoptosis inhibition and angiogenesis . One the other hand, blocking NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by NF-\u03baB inhibitor PDTC could significantly strengthen the radiosensitive effect of curcumin on IR-pretreated ACHN cells. Furthermore, we also found that sensitization of ACHN cells to IR enhanced by curcumin was mediated by NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.", "Based on results from the OST performed as part of the study, horses were allocated into 2 different groups: normal insulin regulation (NIR; peak insulin concentration <45 \u03bcIU/mL) and ID (peak insulin dysregulation ID>45 \u03bcIU/mL). Based on results from the OST, 23 and 26 horses, respectively, were allocated into the NIR and the ID groups. None of the horses included in the NIR group, but 62% (16/26) of horses, included in ID group, had a previous history of laminitis. Physical characteristics for horses included in the study are reported in Table Physical characteristics for horses (n = 49) included in the study divided into normal insulin regulation (NIR) and insulin dysregulation (ID) groups SD, standard deviation; g, gelding; m, mare; BCS, body condition score; CNS, cresty neck score. The breeds represented in the NIR group were Standardbred (n = 10), Icelandic horse (n = 6), Swedish warmblood (n = 1), and Gotland pony (n = 6). Horses in the NIR group had higher The estimated regression coefficient (\u03b2), correlation coefficient ( Correlation coefficient ( Peak Indicate rectangular hyperbolic relationship within row ( Scatter plots of individual horse data (n = 49) showing the relationship between oral sugar test derived indices of \u03b2\u2010cell response: Peak Scatter plots of individual horse data (n = 49) showing the relationship between oral sugar test derived indices of \u03b2\u2010cell response: Peak Selected scatter plots showing the correlation between OST\u2010derived IS indices (ISI Scatter plots showing the relationship between the oral sugar test derived insulin sensitivity indices: Linear regression analysis for oral sugar test derived insulin sensitivity indices (ISI Ln, the natural logarithm; We found a nonlinear inverse relationship for all 12 comparisons between indices of \u03b2\u2010cell response obtained from the OST and the quantitative IS measurements obtained by the EHC. Despite these findings, calculated indices of IS from the OST may be useful to estimate IS in horses, especially when the horse is in a state of IR. It is well known that IR is associated with increased insulin secretion from the \u03b2\u2010cells. The inverse relationship between \u03b2\u2010cell response and IS suggests that horses with ID respond not only with postprandial hyperinsulinemia after intake of nonstructural carbohydrates but are also IR.", "Lung cancer cells were transfected with miR-449a mimics or negative control and exposed to IR, levels of target protein, glycolysis, cell viability, apoptosis and DNA damage were examined. IR exposure significantly increased the expression of miR-449a at doses ranging from 4-8 Gy at 24h in A549 cells, while no significant change of miR-449a was found in H1299 cells after IR. When exposed in IR at indicated dose of 8Gy, miR-449a level only had an acute increase within 12h after IR in A549 cells. MiR-449a restoration dramatically suppressed IR-induced cell apoptosis and DNA damage both in A549 and H1299 cells. LDHA siRNA transfected cells showed enhanced cell apoptosis and DNA damage in response to IR exposure. MiR-449a upregulation enhanced IR sensitivity of lung cancer cells by suppressing LDHA and the subsequent glycolysis.", "In total 48 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (n=8) as follows: i) Sham group; ii) the IR group; iii) IR + 1 \u00b5g/kg dexmedetomidine preconditioning group (pre-LD); iv) IR + 10 \u00b5g/kg dexmedetomidine preconditioning group (pre-HD); v) IR + 1 \u00b5g/kg dexmedetomidine postconditioning group (post-LD); and vi) IR + 10 \u00b5g/kg dexmedetomidine postconditioning group (post-HD). Compared with the sham group, a significant increase in the W/D lung weight ratio, and malondialdehyde (MDA), BNIP3, BNIP3 L and LC3II levels were observed in the IR group, and HIF-1\u03b1 levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were decreased. Furthermore, the W/D ratio was lower in the pre-LD and pre-HD groups than in the IR group. Additionally, SOD activity was significantly higher and MDA expression was significantly lower in the pre-LD and pre-HD groups compared with the IR group. BNIP3, BNIP3 L and LC3II protein levels were significantly lower in the pre-LD and pre-HD groups compared with the IR group, while HIF-1\u03b1 was notably upregulated in the pre-LD and pre-HD groups compared with the IR group. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that dexmedetomidine preconditioning protects against lung injury induced by IR through inhibition of autophagy and apoptosis. Lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI), a form of acute sterile lung injury, remains a frequent complication that may result in morbidity and mortality during lung transplantation ( Autophagy is a cell protective mechanism that is activated in response to stress signals from the endoplasmic reticulum ( A previous study demonstrated that ischemia and immediate reperfusion can trigger autophagy, and that autophagy participates in renal IRI ( The present study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Henan Provincial People's Hospital (Zhengzhou, China). A total of 48 rats were randomly allocated into six groups (n=8 per group) as follows: i) The sham group received saline administration (1 ml/h intravenously) without LIRI; ii) the IR group received saline administration (1 ml/h intravenously) following LIRI; iii) the LIRI + 1 \u00b5g/kg dexmedetomidine preconditioning group [pre-low dose (LD)] received 1 \u00b5g/kg dexmedetomidine prior to LIRI; iv) the LIRI + 10 \u00b5g/kg dexmedetomidine preconditioning group [pre-high dose (HD)] received 10 \u00b5g/kg dexmedetomidine prior to LIRI; v) the IR + 1 \u00b5g/kg dexmedetomidine postconditioning group (post-LD) received 1 \u00b5g/kg dexmedetomidine following LIRI; and vi) the IR +1 0 \u00b5g/kg dexmedetomidine postconditioning group (post-HD) received 10 \u00b5g/kg dexmedetomidine following LIR. The W/D ratios of the IR and post-LD groups were significantly higher compared with the sham group (P<0.05; Lung injury was evaluated by the standards as follows (light microscopy): Pulmonary interstitial edema, alveolar edema, alveolar congestion and neutrophil infiltration. As illustrated in As presented in As demonstrated in As illustrated in The level of HIF-1\u03b1 protein was notably lower in the IR compared with the sham group, although this difference was not statistically significant ( In the present study, lung damage was evaluated by determination of the W/D ratio and imaging techniques. The results indicated that preconditioning with dexmedetomidine produces protection against LIRI in a dose-dependent manner. A previous study demonstrated that the injuries induced by intestinal IR in rats improved with the administration of 5 \u00b5g/kg/h dexmedetomidine compared with 2.5 \u00b5g/kg/h dexmedetomidine prior to ischemia ( Reperfusion injury is directly associated with the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), endothelial cell injury, increased vascular permeability, and the activation and production of neutrophils, platelets, cytokines and the complement system ( Occlusion of the arterial blood supply is caused by an embolus, resulting in ischemia and consequently a serious imbalance between the supply and metabolic demand for oxygen, causing tissue hypoxia. The activation of HIF-1\u03b1 serves a protective role in the IRI of several tissues through regulating inflammation ( Autophagy is a highly conserved process that occurs in all eukaryotes. Autophagy and apoptosis are discrete cellular processes that are mediated by distinct groups of regulatory and executioner molecules ( Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) and Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3 like (BNIP3L), also known as Nix, are members of the BH3-only subfamily of Bcl-2 family proteins, and are critical for the induction of mitochondrial autophagy, in some instances, promotes survival by reducing radical oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage under hypoxic conditions ( Recent studies have identified that BNIP3 and BNIP3L, target genes of HIF-1\u03b1, are important in autophagy ( In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that pulmonary IRI was associated with the upregulation of apoptosis and autophagy. Furthermore, preconditioning with dexmedetomidine provided protection against LIRI in a dose-dependent manner, partially through inhibiting autophagy. Dexmedetomidine was observed to upregulate HIF-1\u03b1 and downregulate BNIP3 and BNIP3 L in the LIRI model in the current study. The results of present study highlight a potential clinical application for dexmedetomidine in reducing LIRI.

The AnxA1 protein is highly expressed in respiratory, renal, brain, and cardiac tissues, as well as in a variety of cells such as neutrophils, fibroblasts, macrophages, and epithelial cells [ IR-induced acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) may develop in various clinical conditions, including lung transplantation, hemorrhagic shock, septic shock, cardiopulmonary bypass, resuscitation for cardiac arrest, and pulmonary embolism. It likely contributes to long-term tissue damage associated with dysfunction and mortality [ A diagram of the experimental protocol is provided in the The increase in lung weight gain in the IR group was attenuated in a dose-dependent manner by the Ac2-26 treatment ( IR significantly increased AnxA1 protein when compared with the control group ( Ac2-26 (1 mg/kg) treatment significantly decreased the concentrations of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1) and TNF-\u03b1 in the IR group ( Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a frequently used biomarker of oxidative stress. Treatment with Ac2-26 (1 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the increases in protein carbonyl contents, MDA levels, and the numbers of MPO-positive cells in the lung tissue of the IR group ( Compared with the control group, the IR group represents the obvious thickening of the alveolar walls and leukocyte infiltrates in the lung histology, which revealed morphological evidence of acute lung injury ( The tight junction protein of the alveolar epithelial cells, including claudin-3 and occludin, maintained the integrity of the permeability barrier of the alveolar walls. In contrast, the IR group showed a defragmented and low-intensity staining in the alveolar walls. Furthermore, Ac2-26 (1 mg/kg) treatment revealed only partial changes in the linear staining of claudin-3, occludin and ZO-1 in the IR group. Ac2-26 (1 mg/kg) treatment significantly increased Bcl-2 protein contents and decreased the number of activated caspase-3-immunolabeled cells in the IR group. However, these protective effects were blocked by the addition of Boc2 ( The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways containing three sequentially key protein kinases, including p38 protein kinase (p38), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal-related protein kinase 1/2 (ERK), were significantly activated by IR in the lung tissue. Ac2-26 significantly reduced the increase of phosphorylated NF-\u03baB p65 in the nucleolus and the decrease of I\u03baB-\u03b1 at 2 h and 4 h after H/R in A549 cells ( The study results demonstrated that AnxA1 peptide Ac2-26 significantly attenuated increased lung edema, PAP, neutrophil infiltration, inflammatory cytokine production, oxidative stress, apoptosis, MAPK activation, I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation, nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB, and tissue damage in acute lung injury induced by IR. Our results suggest a protective role of AnxA1 in IR-induced lung injury and provide pharmacological evidence that the activation of FPRs may be the underlying mechanism for lung protection by Ac2-26. AnxA1 has emerged as a potent anti-inflammatory therapeutic agent in a variety of diseases based on its ability to decrease inflammation both in vitro and in vivo, as well as to provide tissue protection [ IR-induced lung injury is characterized by a marked polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNs) infiltration in the lung interstitium and alveolar space [ NF-\u03baB is an important transcriptional factor responsible for activating the production of various cytokines and chemokines during inflammation. We have previously demonstrated that IR-induced acute lung injury promoted I\u03baB degradation and NF-\u03baB activation [ Several investigations revealed that AnxA1 promoted neutrophil apoptosis and modulated apoptotic neutrophils clearance by macrophages [ MAPKs are comprised of three major families: p38, ERK, and JNK protein kinases that modulate multiple cellular events and the production of inflammatory mediators. Abnormal activation of MAPK signaling results in a series of inflammatory cascades [ IR-induced ALI is the major cause of primary graft dysfunction in the early stages after lung transplantation. The morbidity and mortality associated with IR-induced ALI is still high [ Sprague-Dawley rats (male, 350 \u00b1 20 g) were used in this study and cared for in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines. A value of In summary, we demonstrated that Ac2-26 attenuated IR-induced lung injury. Targeting the AnxA1 signaling pathway may provide a novel approach for the treatment of IR-induced lung injury. IR significantly increased AnxA1 protein expression in the lung tissue.", "Here, we applied a hypo-fractionated irradiation protocol and analyzed delayed lung toxicity DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are major cytotoxic lesions induced by IR and effectively trigger apoptosis or senescence. IR-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are vastly detrimental DNA lesions and effectively trigger cell death. Fortunately, lovastatin did not attenuate IR-induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), which is a relevant cell type in the context of thoracic radiotherapy ( In conclusion, our study provides novel evidence of a radioprotective potency of lovastatin on normal primary human lung cells and rodent lung tissue under situation of hypo-fractionated irradiation, which is at least partially due to inhibition of Rac1 signaling. The work was supported by the Wilhelm Sander-Stiftung (2012.063.1) and by the International Research Training Group IRTG 1902. Lovastatin and EHT1864 treatment have no effect on body weight, but decrease IR-mediated increase in breathing frequency. ( Lovastatin and EHT1864 attenuate IR-induced apoptosis and regenerative proliferation following fractionated irradiation of the lung. Male BALB/c mice were treated according to Lovastatin and EHT1864 attenuate the level of IR-induced residual DNA damage in lung tissue as reflected on the level of Fractionated irradiation causes a persistent activation of the DDR-related factors ATM, p53 and Kap-1 in lung tissue four weeks after the last irradiation.", "Even in the absence of overt obesity, a preferential deposition of intra-abdominal fat is noted in PCOS women and this intra-abdominal fat leads to impaired insulin action and functional IR and hyperandrogenism. Functional ovarian hyperandrogenism of ovaries was suggested to be a consequence of IR, which activates androgen synthesizing enzyme, cytochrome p450-c17\u03b1-hydroxylase, in ovarian theca cells and causes elevated oxidative stress accompanied by lower antioxidant status in ovaries, which contribute to PCOS pathogenesis. The risk of developing gestational diabetes in PCOS women is approximately three times greater, as compared to non-PCOS women, due to IR and hyperinsulinemia. Typical insulin-sensitizing drugs such as metformin, have been used to curtail IR and hyperinsulinemia in pregnant PCOS women, with varying results indicating the complexity of the disease and the need for better controlled studies and additional efforts for PCOS-specific drug discovery. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a very common reproductive endocrinological disorder seen in women, affecting 5\u201320% of the reproductive age women globally ( Apparently, the incidence of MS among PCOS patients seems to be affected also by the geographical region as well as the habits of the patients as it has been recently shown that in Iran the incidence of MS in the Iranian PCOS patients (19.7%) is less than that seen in United States (33\u201346%) ( It is well-known that there is elevated risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes and other pregnancy-related complications including venous thromboembolism, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events and endometrial cancer in patients with PCOS ( The association between hyperandrogenism and PCOS stemmed from the observations that elevated levels of free testosterone in plasma of hirsute amenorrheic women actually originate from ovaries ( Functional ovarian hyperandrogenism was suggested to be a consequence of IR, which causes elevated oxidative stress accompanied by lower antioxidant status in ovaries ( Inasmuch as significant populations of PCOS women are insulin resistant and hyperinsulinemic, they are highly prone to develop type 2 diabetes. People suffering from MetS display varying degrees of these abnormalities, which primarily result from complex multi-organ interactions of IR, obesity and age ( Besides the known association of type 2 diabetes with PCOS as mentioned above, type 1 diabetes also appears to be associated with PCOS and this is particularly because of the very high doses of insulin administered to these patients systemically, for controlling hyperglycemia ( PCOS is a very common endocrine disorder affecting a significant proportion of women worldwide and yet there is no effective treatment for this disease. Functional ovarian hyperandrogenism of ovaries, is a consequence of IR, and develops by the activation of androgen synthesis and contributes to PCOS pathogenesis. Despite several common conditions such as diabetes, IR and MetS, seen in non-PCOS obese women, the treatment options available for non-PCOS women do not always work effectively in PCOS women, because of the complexity of the disease. Typical insulin sensitizing drugs such as metformin, have been tried to curtail IR and hyperinsulinemia in pregnant PCOS women, with varying results indicating the complexity of the disease and the need for better controlled studies and additional efforts for PCOS specific drug discovery.", "Here we demonstrate myeloid IKK\u03b2 deficiency prevents Western diet-induced obesity and visceral adiposity in females but not in males, and attenuates hyperglycemia, global IR, and NASH in both genders. Inflammation is recognized as a potential causal factor in developing IR [ Another outstanding question is the mechanism of the gender effect on diet-induced obesity, IR, and NASH. Postmenopausal women are susceptible to visceral obesity, IR and type 2 diabetes [ In the present study, we have examined the effects of hepatocyte or myeloid specific IKK\u03b2 deficiency on obesity, IR, and NAFLD/NASH induced by 20 wk feeding of a Western diet high in cholesterol and saturated fat diet (HCFD) in both male and female mice. Wild type (Wt), myeloid IKK\u03b2 deficient ( HCFD feeding increases the hepatic levels of a nuclear (activated) form of SREBP-1c (nSREBP-1c), a potent lipogenic transcription factor, in Wt mice in both genders but more conspicuously in males ( Wild type (Wt), myeloid IKK\u03b2 deficient ( WAT inflammation is suggested to be causally linked to obesity-associated IR [ (A), (C), (E) and (G) are representative microphotographs from a male Wt mouse fed control diet from 2.5 months of age for 20 weeks as opposed to (B), (D), (F) and (H) from a male The hepatocyte IKK\u03b2 deficiency worsens HCFD-induced NASH in male but not female mice. SULT1E1 activity in the liver is increased by HCFD in both genders and further increased only in male The present study demonstrates the gender-specific, differential regulatory roles of IKK\u03b2 in myeloid cells and hepatocytes in obesity, IR, and NASH induced by HCFD in mice as summarized in *This table summarizes changes in the listed metabolic and pathologic parameters as compared to Wt mice fed chow (Wt control) in each gender. In summary, our results revealed that the gender profoundly influences the way IKK\u03b2 in myeloid cells or hepatocytes regulates the genesis or severity of HCFD-induced obesity, IR, and NASH.", "Taken together, these studies demonstrate that PKM2 may promote hepatic IR via STAT3 pathway and would provide a new insight into dissecting the molecular pathogenesis of hepatic insulin resistance.", "Stat5b and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) interact with the same autophosphorylation site in the IR [phosphotyrosine (pY) 972] in yeast two-hybrid assays, and the IR phosphorylates Stat5b in vitro. These data suggest that Stat5 proteins might be recruited to, and phosphorylated by, the activated IR in vivo. Nevertheless, insulin activates Janus kinases (JAKs) in IR-overexpressing cell lines and in insulin target tissues. To determine whether Stat5 proteins must be recruited to the pY972LSA motif in the IR for insulin-stimulated activation in mammalian cells, we generated and tested a series of IR mutants. The L973R/A975D mutation abolishes the ability of the IR to induce Stat5 activation, whereas IRS-1 phosphorylation is unaffected. In contrast, the N969A/P970A mutation in the IR has no effect on Stat5 activation but significantly reduces IRS-1 phosphorylation. In coimmunoprecipitation assays, insulin-stimulated Stat5 activation correlates with Stat5 recruitment to the IR. We also find that insulin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of JAKs that are constitutively associated with the IR. This likely represents phosphorylation of Stat5 proteins by the IR, as we find that IR kinase domain phosphorylates Stat5b in vitro on Y699 as efficiently as JAK2. Increasing the concentration of Stat5 proteins in cells favors the direct phosphorylation of Stat5 by the IR kinase where the DN-JAK inhibition of insulin-stimulated Stat5 activation becomes insignificant. At physiological levels of Stat5 however, we propose that JAKs and the IR both contribute to the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Stat5.", "Using various stimuli, including TNF-\u03b1, PMA, LPS, interleukins, and UV or IR, it has been well established in many cell lines that signal-induced activation of NF-\u03baB typically occurs through site-specific phosphorylation and ubiquitination of a complexed I\u03baB protein with subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome . Pretreatment of HeLa cells with SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 (MAPK), partially abrogated the ability of indomethacin to inhibit IR-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and significantly reversed the radiosensitizing effect of indomethacin. In addition, overexpression of MKK6b also diminished IR-induced activation of NF-\u03baB transactivation activity as measured by luciferase reporter assays. From a gene expression profile of MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with fractionated ionizing radiation (FIR) , up-regulated cyclin B1 was found to be one of the critical elements responsible for FIR-induced radioresistance. The relationship between these IR-responsive signaling elements and IR-induced NF-\u03baB activation needs further clarification. Further analysis of DNA microarray profiles found a group of stress-responsive genes activated in FIR-treated human keratinocyte cell line HK18-IR that showed radioresistance phenotype . Similar alterations in gene expression were observed in array profiles from FIR-treated MCF-7 cells (3.9%) and FIR-treated human keratinocytes (4.4%) . These results suggest that changes in gene expression are similar in FIR-derived radioresistant cells and cells exposed to a single dose of irradiation, both of which activate NF-\u03baB. Presumably, the signal elements specifically regulated by IR-induced NF-\u03baB, rather than the transcription factor itself, may provide new molecular targets that determine radiosensitivity. Results from DNA binding and reporter transfection analyses further suggest that transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB is apparently involved in the radioresistance of HK18-IR cells. Among the genes up-regulated in the HK18-IR profiles, six genes were identified as putatively under NF-\u03baB regulation . Because the down-regulation of these genes correlates well with a significant decrease in the survival of HK18-IR cells after radiation, expression of any or all of these NF-\u03baB effector genes, i.e. Gene blocking experiments are needed to correlate radiosensitivity with specific IR-induced NF-\u03baB effector genes. In MCF-7-IR cells, radioresistance that was quantified by increased clonogenic survival and reduced growth delay was correlated with up-regulation of cyclin B1.", "Anesthetic preconditioning (APC) attenuates IR injury. Control (CON) hearts received no treatment for 50 min before IR; APC hearts were exposed to 1.2 mM (8.8 vol%) sevoflurane for 15 min; APC + 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) hearts received 200 micro M 5-HD from 5 min before to 15 min after sevoflurane exposure; and 5-HD hearts received 5-HD for 35 min. 5-HD pretreatment alone did not affect m[Ca(2+)] (470 +/- 34 nM) or IR injury.", "The presence of IR and IGF receptors in insulin-producing cell lines was reported in and , respectively. IRS-1, -2, -3 and -4, are detectable in pancreatic \u03b2-cells and that downstream located effector proteins, such as phosphoinositide 3\u2032-kinase (PI3 kinase), PKB/Akt, p70s6k, PHAS-1 can be activated by glucose or direct insulin stimulation , it was a major breakthrough when Rothenberg et al. in 1995 reported that insulin, secreted upon glucose stimulation, activated the \u03b2-cell IR and the downstream located IRS and PI3 kinase. In contrast to these studies, disruption of insulin signaling in animal models at the level of IRS-2, as in the IRS-2 knockout mouse , or in the \u03b2-cell restricted knockout of the IR, \u03b2IRKO mouse , led to the reduction in pancreatic insulin content in the adult state and consequently to the development of a type 2 diabetes mellitus-like phenotype. Although a genetically engineered knockout of insulin expression led to \u03b2-cell hyperplasia in the prenatal state , thus supporting the idea of insulin being a negative regulator in maintaining \u03b2-cell mass, surprisingly neither the \u03b2-cell restricted knockout of the IR or the IGF-IR (\u03b2IGFIRKO) , nor the combined general knockout of IR and IGF-IR led to a change in \u03b2-cell mass prenatally, suggesting that neither insulin nor IGF-I seems to be involved in \u03b2-cell proliferation. In contrast to the \u03b2IGFIRKO mouse, \u03b2IRKO mice show an age-dependent decrease in \u03b2-cell mass which indicates a different function of the two receptors in the postnatal development of islets. While our data revealed that insulin, secreted upon glucose stimulation, is a key factor in glucose-dependent up-regulation of insulin gene transcription in primary rat and mouse \u03b2-cells as well as in the insulin-producing cell line HIT-T15 by signaling through IR-A/PI3 kinase/p70s6k , Xu and Rothenberg at the same time reported that overexpression of IR in the insulin-producing cell line \u03b2TC6 led to an increase in insulin mRNA levels, insulin content and insulin secretion. Since in the process of insulin secretion the concentration of the hormone reaches levels much higher than observed in peripheral blood, an interesting question was whether insulin activates the transcription of its own gene by signaling through the IR or through IGF-IR. On the other hand, overexpression of IRs led to a pronounced activation of the insulin promoter in response to either glucose or insulin, whereas blocking IRs by employing IR-blocking antibodies drastically reduced up-regulation of insulin promoter activity by the two stimuli . The most convincing evidence for the involvement of IRs in this signaling cascade came from experiments in islets isolated from \u03b2IRKO mice . The IR exists in two isoforms as a result of alternative splicing of the 11th exon (for review see ). The A-type (IR-A, Ex11\u2212) lacks the 12 amino acids encoded by exon 11, whereas the B-type (IR-B, Ex11+) contains the respective amino acid sequence, which is located extracellularly at the C-terminus of the \u03b1-subunit of the receptor. Overexpression of IR-A led to a pronounced effect of insulin stimulation on insulin promoter activation, while overexpression of IR-B did not . The \u03b2IRKO mouse, having a \u03b2-cell restricted knockout of the IR, exhibits a selective loss of glucose-stimulated acute insulin secretion and develops a diabetes type 2-like phenotype at the age of 8 weeks . A similar phenotype is shown by the \u03b2IGFIRKO mouse with a \u03b2-cell restricted knockout of the IGF-1R . As mentioned above, in some reports, feedback via the IR has been suggested to be part of a feed-forward mechanism that stimulates insulin secretion by increasing [Ca] . Aspinwall and co-workers show an insulin-stimulated increase in [Ca] within seconds after the start of stimulation, which originates from intracellular Ca stores rather than from extracellular Ca entry and involves IRS-1 and PI3 kinase activity. when using the fungal insulin mimetic L-783,281, again via an IRS-1/PI3 kinase-dependent pathway. Data from Wolf\u2019s laboratory also identify IRS-1 as a key regulator in insulin-dependent \u03b2-cell Ca homeostasis but suggest a different mechanism. Data in support of this model show that glucose-dependent transcription of the glucokinase gene in pancreatic \u03b2-cells requires insulin signaling via IR-B/PI3 kinase class II\u03b1-like activity and very likely PKB/Akt . However, the long-term effect of the lack of insulin-dependent regulation of glucokinase protein expression and enzyme activation may partly explain the abolished glucose-dependent first-phase secretory response observed in the \u03b2IRKO and \u03b2IGFIRKO mouse models . within seconds to a few minutes, influence on even the first phase of insulin exocytosis, as reported in , very likely mediated by IRS and/or PI3 kinase products. tyrosine phosphorylation by the IR) and later inactivation (i.e. serine phosphorylation by insulin-activated atypical protein kinase C) of IR and IRS .", "Spontaneous mutations leading to whole body ablation of the IR leads to severe insulin resistance and neonatal death in both humans and animals . Homozygous targeted disruption of the IR in the whole body promotes hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, leading to severe ketosis and death within few days . However, heterozygous IR disruption produces a mild phenotype with only 10% of animals developing diabetes at later stages of life . The disruption of IR specifically in pancreatic \u03b2 cells using the Cre-lox system under the control of the insulin promoter leads to a progressive loss in glucose-induced first-phase insulin secretion, decreased islet volume and insulin content, and age-dependent glucose intolerance . Genetic manipulation of the main substrates of the IR offered further information on the role of insulin upon the control of \u03b2 cell function. Thus, IRS1 whole body knockout produces growth retardation accompanied by islet hyperplasia and increased insulin secretion , while IRS2 whole body knockout leads to severe insulin resistance, \u03b2 cell hypoplasia with decreased insulin secretion and early-onset diabetes . In isolated \u03b2 cells IRS1 participates in the control of insulin secretion through a mechanism that involves the lipid metabolizing enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and the mobilization of Ca . On the other hand, IRS2 expression in \u03b2 cells seems to be involved in the control of cell growth and mitogenesis . According to the current concepts a paradigm has been generated proposing that, once secreted by pancreatic \u03b2 cells, insulin acts upon an autocrine loop activating \u03b2 cell IRs that lead to IRS1 engagement and further enhancement of insulin secretion through a Ca-dependent mechanism . Through the same autocrine loop insulin (probably to a lesser extent than IGF-1) activates IRS2, which participates in the control of \u03b2 cell growth and mitogenesis, most probably during early phases of development or in \u03b2 cell tumorigenesis , or yet, in the induction of transcription of genes that encode proteins that participate in the physiologic control of \u03b2 cell function . Antibodies against IR\u03b2 (SC-711), IRS1 (SC-560), IRS2 (SC-1556), somatostatin (SC-7819), and glucagon (SC-7779) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Sense and antisense phosphorthioate oligonucleotide specific for IRS1 (sense, 5\u2032 ACC CAC TCC TAT CCC G 3\u2032 and antisense, 5\u2032 CGG GAT AGG AGT GGG T 3\u2032) were produced by Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). This sequence was selected among three unrelated pairs of oligonucleotides on the basis of their ability to block IRS1 protein expression as evaluated by immunoblot of total protein extracts of isolated pancreatic islets utilizing specific anti-IRS1 antibodies. Sections were incubated for 30 min with 2% normal rabbit, normal goat or normal mouse sera at room temperature, and then exposed for 12 h in moister chamber at 4%\u00b0C to the primary antibodies against IR\u03b2 (1/20), IRS1 (1/50), IRS2 (1/50), glucagon (1/50), somatostatin (1/20), or insulin (1/50). Groups of five freshly isolated islets were initially incubated for 6 h at 37\u00b0C in RPMI 2.8 mM glucose with no oligonucleotide, or in the presence of either 4 nM sense or 4 nM antisense IRS1 oligonucleotide. RPMI was then replaced and islets were maintained for 1 h under the experimental conditions (RPMI containing 2.8 mM, 11 mM or 16.7 mM glucose, with either no oligonucleotide addition or in the presence of sense or antisense IRS1 oligonucleotide). Groups of 100 freshly isolated islets were pre-incubated during 6 h at 37\u00b0C in RPMI 2.8 mM glucose with no oligonucleotide or in the presence of either 4 nM sense or 4 nM antisense IRS1 oligonucleotide. For specific protein determination groups of 300 freshly isolated islets were incubated for 6 h in RPMI containing 2.8 mM glucose in the presence of 4 nM sense or antisense IRS1 oligonucleotide or with no addition of oligonucleotide. For immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis and for IRS1-associated PI3-kinase activity assays, groups of 800 pancreatic islets were exposed to experimental conditions and technical procedures were performed as previously described . Insulin 10 M (insulin concentration within the pancreatic islet microenvironment of living animals is believed to oscillate between 10 and 10 M in fasting and fed conditions, respectively) , sense or antisense IRS1 phosphorthioate-modified oligonucleotide were added as required. Since the first observation of IR, IRS1 and IRS2 expression in pancreatic islets no further progression was achieved on the characterization of the cellular distribution of such elements in endocrine pancreas . Using antibodies specific for IR, IRS1, IRS2, insulin, glucagon and somatostatin, and utilizing an array of immunohistochemical methods, a full characterization of the tissue distribution of each of the elements that participate in the early steps of insulin signaling in pancreatic islets was obtained. IR is expressed in all cell types of the islet. A series of double-staining immunohistochemical studies utilizing antibodies against IR in conjunction with either insulin, glucagon or somatostatin antibodies, allowed for mapping the expression of IR predominantly to somatostatin producing cells, however some co-localization with glucagon was detected (). The characteristics of IRS1 expression in rat pancreatic islets are the same as for IR. Thus, IRS1 is widely expressed in pancreatic islets (), and employing double stain technique evaluated by conventional and confocal microscopy most of the expression was revealed to occur in \u03b4 cells (). Finally and similarly, IRS2 is present in all cells of the islets with highest expression occurring at the periphery () and depicting an impressive co-localization with somatostatin (). Therefore, based on the characteristics of tissue distribution of IR and its substrates, it is suggested that both autocrine and paracrine signaling of insulin shall play a role in whole islet function. Since all studies on which proteins of the insulin-signaling pathway were knocked out were undertaken in mice, we performed immunohistochemical evaluation of IR, IRS1 and IRS2 in pancreas of CBA/J mice and detected a similar pattern of specific protein distribution as in rat islets (not shown). Supported by evidence that IRS1 participates in the control of insulin secretion through PI3-kinase-modulated Ca influx , and that IRS2 may be more importantly related to cell growth and mitogenesis , we decided for evaluating the role of IRS1 in autocrine and paracrine insulin signaling by blocking IRS1 protein synthesis utilizing phosphorthioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides specific for IRS1. Islet specific expression of IR and IRS1 is approximately 0.3-fold that observed in tissues that traditionally respond to insulin stimulus, such as liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle ( ). Thus, increases of 2.0 and 2.5-fold in IR (<0.05) and IRS1 (<0.05) tyrosine phosphorylation, respectively, are induced after 90 s islet exposure to 10 M insulin (). Exposure of islets to high glucose concentration (16.7 mM) for 3 min also induced significant increase in IR and IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation (). Following insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IR and IRS1 a series of intracellular branches of the insulin-signaling cascade may be induced. Exposure of isolated islets to 10 M insulin for 5 min induces a significant increase (1.7-fold, <0.05) in IRS1-associated PI3-kinase activity (), reproducing in that way the characteristics of the molecular response to insulin observed in traditional target tissues. In order to evaluate the property of phosphorthioate-modified oligonucleotides antisense to block IRS1 protein synthesis, three different sequences were tested. Incubation times were either 3 h or 6 h. Based on the results obtained, the sequence 5\u2032 CGG GAT AGG AGT GGG T 3\u2032 for antisense IRS1 and its respective sense were selected for the studies. Six hours incubation in the presence of the selected antisense oligonucleotide was sufficient to promote 45% reduction in IRS1 expression in isolated islets ( ) and was utilized as standard pre-incubation time in all experiments. No changes in insulin secretion were promoted by exposure of islets to IRS1 sense oligonucleotide (). Similarly, during dynamic insulin secretion studies the blockade of IRS1 expression was accompanied by a significant increase in glucose-induced insulin secretion both when islets were exposed to a medium containing 11 mM or 16.7 mM glucose (, respectively). Of particular interest, it was observed that treatment with antisense IRS1 oligonucleotide coincided with a reduction of insulin secretion rate in islets exposed to 2.8 mM glucose, and that the increased rate of insulin secretion under high glucose condition was more pronounced after 15 min of 11 mM or 16.7 mM glucose exposure (), which might suggest that intermediary steps in signaling shall participate in the observed phenomenon. Determination of insulin-induced insulin mRNA expression in pancreatic islets showed that exposure of isolated islets to exogenous insulin at a concentration of 10 M for 6 h produces a significant decrease (0.65-fold, =4; <0.05, as compared to islets maintained in 2.8 mM glucose without exogenous insulin) in insulin mRNA species, while blockade of IRS1 expression by antisense oligonucleotide treatment for 6 h preceding and during exogenous insulin treatment could partially inhibit the capacity of exogenous insulin to negatively modulate insulin mRNA expression (0.9-fold, =4; n.s. Since higher expression levels of IR and IRS1 were detected in cells located at the periphery of the islets (mostly in \u03b4 cells), we decided to investigate the role of IRS1 blockade upon the pattern of secretion of glucagon and somatostatin in isolated islets exposed to low (2.8 mM) or high (16.7 mM) glucose concentrations. Previous attempts to characterize the presence of IR or functional binding sites for insulin in \u03b1 cells were not successful , and in the present series of experiments we were also unable to provide undisputed evidence for that fact. However, the pattern of staining for IR, IRS1 and IRS2 observed in more than 60 different sections evaluated during these studies (), plus the characteristics of glucagon secretion in IRS1 depleted islet ( ) and the modulation of glucagon mRNA expression in the presence of exogenous insulin and under the blockade of IRS1 () strongly suggest that IR is present and functional in glucagon-secreting cells. In the present studies the blockade of IRS1 promoted no significant changes in the rate of somatostatin secretion under either low or high glucose concentrations (). Nevertheless, the partial blockade of IRS1 protein expression promoted a significant fall in somatostatin mRNA expression in pancreatic islets (). The present results suggest that insulin, by acting through IRS1, may stimulate somatostatin mRNA expression and possibly participate in the control of the \u03b4 cell\u2019s hormone secretion. As a whole the present studies provide evidence that the blockade of IRS1 expression promotes significant increase in glucose-induced insulin secretion. Based on that, a model for explaining the participation of IRS1 on paracrine and autocrine insulin signaling, and the functional feedback exerted by glucagon and possibly by somatostatin, is presented ( ). Hampering of insulin signaling in pancreatic islets by blocking IRS1 expression leads to a \u03b2 cell inhibitory effect, which is apparently overcome by a more robust signal of reduced somatostatin accompanied by an inversion in the pattern of glucagon secretion.", "The Bcl-X(L) protein, but not Bcl-X(S), was identified to be induced by IR. In agreement with the increased transcript level, Bcl-X(L) protein level was also observed to increase in cells with wild-type p53 where IR triggered apoptosis. In addition, a survey of the BCL-X(L) mRNA basal levels in human cells with known apoptotic responses showed that low basal levels of BCL-X(L) mRNA in cells were highly correlated with a strong ability of cells to undergo IR-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, high levels of basal BCL-X(L) were correlated with the resistance of cells to IR-induced apoptosis regardless of p53 status. These results indicate that BCL-2 and BCL-X(L) behave differently in response to DNA damage treatment even though they both are able to protect cells from p53-mediated apoptosis; along with down-regulation of BCL-2, BCL-X(L) was up-regulated by IR in human cells with wild-type p53 and susceptibility to IR-induced apoptosis.", "Wortmannin was used to determine if the potentiation of IR-induced cytotoxicity in Chinese hamster ovary cells could be accounted for by an inhibition of DNA double strand break (DSB) repair. Wortmannin, at concentrations which were non-toxic per se (5 and 20 microM), increased IR cytotoxicity with dose enhancement factors at 10% survival of 2.7+/-0.28 (5 microM) and 5.3+/-0.86 (20 microM). There was an excellent correlation between the concentration-dependence and exposure time of wortmannin required to enhance IR cytotoxicity and inhibit DSB repair. These data implicate inhibition of DNA-dependent protein kinase, and the consequent inhibition of DSB repair, as the mechanism whereby wortmannin potentiates the cytotoxicity of IR.", "OA stimulated glucose transport activity, altered the electrophoretic mobility of IRS-1, increased the phosphorylation of the MAP-kinases ERK 1 and 2 on tyrosine sites, markedly increased MAP kinase activity and also acted synergistically with insulin in activating these enzymes. Introduction Abbreviations: OA, okadaic acid; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidyli- nositol 3-kinase; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; MAP-kinase, mitogen- activated protein kinase; GLUT, glucose transporter; MBP, myelin basic protein. Serine/threonine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) by OA was re- cently shown to inhibit its subsequent tyrosine phos- phorylation by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and also to inhibit the binding of the p85 and p110 subunits of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) to IRS-1 [6]. Antiphos- photyrosine monoclonal antibody (clone 4G10), anti- Rat MAP kinase R2 (erkl-ct) polyclonal antibodies and anti-IRS-1 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). In some cases, the MAP kinases and IRS-1 were detected by using 0.2 ~xCi/ml 125I-labelled Protein A. / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1314 (1996) 49-56 53 200-- 116-- 97-- 66-- 4 IRS- 1 4 p120 4-1R 4 p60 I I i i i I i i Fig. Effect of okadaic acid and/or insulin on tyrosine phos- phorylation of the insulin receptor, IRS-1, p 60 and p 120. OA alone did not increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of any of these proteins but, in contrast, reduced the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 and p 120, a protein that appeared to be constitutively phosphorylated since we saw no consistent effect of insulin (Fig. insulin-mediated increase in tyrosine phosphate con- tent of p 60 as well as p 120 but had no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of IR or IRS-1. Effect of staurosporine on IRS-1 phosphorylation anti-IRS 1 I I I I I I I The electrophoretic mobility of IRS-1 was altered by insulin or OA alone and, in particular, by the combination of these agents (Fig. The apparent hyperphosphorylation by insulin and OA led to a considerable broadening of the IRS-1 band. Stau- rosporine reduced the mobility shift of IRS-1 seen with insulin and OA alone and also reduced the effect of the combination of insulin and OA (Fig. Mobility shift of IRS-I by okadaic acid (OA) and insulin (Ins) in the absence or presence of staurosporine (St). 1, and whole cell lysates were then immunoblotted with anti-IRS-1 C-terminal polyclonal antibody as described in the Section 2. However, the insulinomimetic ef- fects of OA are not associated with an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of key proteins involved in insulin action such as IR, IRS-1, and p 60, which may represent shc [15,16]. In fact, OA, probably by enhancing serine/threonine phosphorylation, reduced the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Importantly, staurosporine did not inhibit the insulin-stimulated-PI 3-kinase activity nor the association of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with IRS-1 (data not shown), suggesting that its action, like that of OA, was exerted downstream of or was independent of PI 3-kinase. PI 3-kinase is a lipid and serine/threonine kinase [20] which becomes activated by the binding of the p85 regulatory subunit to IRS-1 [20]. However, serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1 seems to impair the binding of p85 [6]. The electrophoretic mobility of IRS-1 was altered in lysates from cells exposed to OA. This finding, combined with a reduced tyrosine phosphorylation, is consistent with an effect of OA to increase serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1 [6]. Inter- estingly, staurosporine inhibited the mobility of IRS- 1 C.M. These find- ings are consistent with an inhibitory effect of stau- rosporine on serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS- 1. Further support for the importance of PKC and/or other downstream serine/threonine kinases is the observation that stau- rosporine did not affect the insulin-stimulated tyro- sine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor or IRS-1 or the activation of PI 3-kinase. Our results are consistent with an increased serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1, as well as other proteins, leading to the insulin-mimetic ef- fects as well as the rest,oration of insulin action on glucose transport and MAP kinase activity in the presence of staurosporine.", "Mutagenesis studies have shown that some amino acids located in the transmembrane helices are crucial for high- affinity calcium binding (see Andersen and Vilsen, 1995, for a review), but the spatial arrangement of these amino acids in a proposed channel-like structure (Inesi, 1987) is 2970 Time-Resolved FTIRSpectroscopy oftheSRCa2+-ATPase still unknown. We report here a study of calcium binding to Ca21_ ATPase monitored by Fourier transformed infrared differ- ence spectroscopy (FTIR). This canbeachievedbythe use ofphotoactivable caged compounds, which release the substrates oftheprotein in the IR sample upon application ofaUV flash.

PhotolysisofDM-nitrophen for IRexperiments DM-nitrophen was photolyzed during IR experiments by a burst of 140 flashes at 308 nm provided by a XeCl excimer laser (Lambda Physik, Gottingen, Germany). In all experiments, 98-100% extent ofphotolysis was achievedwithin0.42s, ascontrolledbythesaturationoftheamplitude ofthe IR bands induced uponphotolysis.

As a precaution we have assumed thatthe dissociation constant ofDM-N is equiva- lent to that ofEDTA in choosing the calcium and DM-N concentrationsinIRexperiments,andwehaveassumedthat thepHandionicstrengthdependenceoftheDM-Napparent dissociationconstantwithcalciumwouldbesimilartothose of EDTA. The variation induced by the different ionic strengthsintheIRmeasurements(0.4M)wasevaluatedby the method of Smith and Miller (1985) and found to be withintherange oferrorthatcan be inducedbythe use of different sets ofabsolute affinity constants at agiven ionic strength. This fact andthehighratioofconcentrationofunphotolyzedDM-N/ high-affinity calcium binding sites in the IR experiments allowtheCa2+-ATPasetobemostlyfreeofcalciumbefore photolysis, the calciumbeing bound to the DM-N. We have evaluated the affinity ofphotolyzed DM-N for calcium by using a calcium-specific electrode to measure the free calcium concentration in a solution ofknown total calciumconcentration andphotolyzedDM-N. Six different measurements gave a lower estimate of 12 mM for the apparent dissociation constant of the photolyzed DM-N with calcium at pH 7.2. This value is four orders of magnitude higher than the apparent dissociation constant ofCa2+-ATPase and ensures that, in the IR mea- surements, about4mMcalciumliberatedbythephotolysis of DM-N will saturate about 1.4-3 mM of high-affinity transport sites instead of binding to about 30 mM photo- lyzed DM-N.

We have investigated the role of RalA and RalB in cellular responses to IR. Knockdown of K-Ras, RalA or RalB reduced colony-forming ability post-IR and knockdown of either Ral isoform decreased the rate of DSB repair post-IR. Surprisingly, neither RalBP1 nor Sec5 suppression affected colony formation post-IR. Both RalA and RalB contribute to K-Ras-dependent IR resistance of MIA PaCa-2 cells. Our goal here was to determine if RalA or RalB also regulate cellular responses to IR. Approximately 18 h after plating, cells were irradiated with a single dose (2 Gy or 7 Gy) from a Cs To assess the role of Ral GTPases in the response of PDAC cells to IR, we utilized MIA PaCa-2 cells, which exhibit K-Ras-dependent radioresistance, hyper-activation of Ral proteins, Ral dependent tumorigenic and metastatic growth ( Post-IR survival was analyzed using standard clonogenic survival assays. We generated MIA PaCa-2 cells that stably expressed shRNAs targeting RalB and either RalA or NS control ( We sought to understand the mechanisms whereby Ral knockdowns cause reduced survival post-IR. RalB is believed to contribute to tumor survival by inhibiting apoptosis ( We next wished to determine which Ral effectors contribute to the Ral-dependent response to IR. We first analyzed RalBP1 (also known as RLIP76), a multi-domain protein required for protection against IR in C57BL/6 mice ( We next analyzed the role of Sec5, the other major Ral effector. Sec5 is a member of the exocyst complex that is critically involved in vesicle targeting and can also function downstream of RalB in cell survival, as RalB activation promotes Sec5 interaction with TBK1 kinase ( Oncogenic Ras induces IR resistance in many tumor types, including pancreatic cancer, where over 90% of tumors carry oncogenic mutations in K-Ras. Recent work indicates that K-Ras-mediated resistance to IR in pancreatic cancer cells is in part dependent upon the Ras effector PI3K ( The molecular mechanisms of Ras-regulated IR response are poorly understood. Although not a classical Ral effector pathway, in that interaction does not depend on GTP binding, Ral activation of phospholipase D1 (PLD1) has been implicated in cytokinesis and other cellular processes ( In conclusion, our results indicate that both RalA and RalB make significant contribution to K-Ras dependent IR resistance of MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells. Neither canonical effector, RalBP1 nor Sec5, has a significant individual role in post-IR survival. Bottom, clonogenic growth assay indicates that knockdown of both Ral proteins did not result in an additional decrease in post-IR survival compared to knockdown of either protein alone. Top panels, Immunoblot analysis of \u03b3H2AX levels at indicated times after administration of IR (7 Gy). Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage was used to determine if IR-induced apoptotic cell death is altered by RalA or RalB knockdown.", "In response to IR-induced DNA damage, the kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) becomes autophosphorylated and phosphorylates histones such as H2Ax (\u03b3H2Ax), leading to recruitment of DNA repair complexes at double-strand break (DSB) sites . showed IR- and ATM-induced LKB1 phosphorylation, but AMPK was not investigated. We hypothesized that, in response to IR, AMPK may link ATM with regulation of the cell cycle and survival. Therefore we examined the regulation of AMPK by IR, as well as its signaling pathway and cellular effects in human cancer cells. In addition, we began to explore the physiologic effects of combining metformin with IR in lung cancer cells. Cells were exposed to 2 to 8 Gy of IR by use of a Co clinical radiation unit. Preincubation with drugs was performed for 1 h before IR, followed by incubation for 1 h, unless otherwise indicated. Twenty-four hours after seeding, cells were pretreated with CC (1 \u03bcmol/L) for 1 h followed by IR (8 Gy). After 24 h, cells were treated with CC (1 \u03bcmol/L) or metformin (5 \u03bcmol/L) followed by IR and an additional 7-day incubation. We first examined the effects of IR on AMPK phosphorylation and detected a robust IR-induced time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation of the AMPK \u03b1 subunit at Thr172 without affecting total levels of the protein (A and B). Increasing doses of IR from 0 to 8 Gy caused enhanced AMPK phosphorylation in both SK-MES and A549 cells (B). AMPK phosphorylation reached peak levels at 1 h after IR (A) and decreased over time but remained activated up to 24 h later. To explore whether IR activation of AMPK is a ubiquitous phenomenon, we also examined other human epithelial cancer lines of lung (A549, SK-MES, H23, and H1299), prostate (PC3, LNCap, 22RV1), and breast (MCF-7) origin. We detected similar activation of AMPK by IR in all cells (D). We found that \u03b3H2Ax was almost undetectable in the untreated nuclei but IR caused a robust increase in \u03b3H2Ax signal in all cells. In parallel with \u03b3H2Ax, we detected intense punctate staining of P-AMPK in the nucleus, within 15 minutes after IR. By 1 h, IR increased significantly the nuclear and particularly the cytoplasmic P-AMPK. We examined the IR-induced phosphorylation of ATM and AMPK in LKB1\u2013wild-type (SK-MES and H1299) and LKB1-null (A549 and H23) cells. IR activated AMPK and ATM in all cells independent of LKB1 expression ( .A). In LKB1-null A549 cells, IR activated ATM and AMPK (B) and induced expression of p53 and p21. To examine whether ATM is involved in AMPK activation by IR, we used the specific ATM inhibitor KU-55933 . KU-55933 abolished IR phosphorylation of ATM but also of AMPK and induction of p53 and p21 (B). To examine the role of AMPK in IR induction of p53 and p21, we used biochemical and molecular inhibition of AMPK. In A549 cells inhibition of AMPK with CC (25 \u03bcmol/L) abolished IR activation of AMPK. Importantly, AMPK inhibition by CC abolished IR induction of p53 and p21. CC and IR effects were similar in A549 and H1299 cells (C). Interestingly, IR induced p21 not only in p53\u2013wild-type A549 cells but also in p53-null H1299 cells. Inhibition of AMPK expression with anti\u2013AMPK \u03b1 siRNA inhibited IR induction of p53 and p21, similar to CC (D and E). In H1299 cells IR induced a 2-fold increase (from 14.7% \u00b1 2.1% to 30.7% \u00b1 0.5%) in the cells accumulated at the G2/M phase of the cycle (A). Pretreatment with CC (1 \u03bcmol/L) abolished the IR-mediated G2/M checkpoint in H1299 cells, reducing the cell population in the G2/M phase back to control levels (of 15.0% \u00b1 2.8%) (A, nontransfected cells). B shows that 1 \u03bcmol/L of CC was also able to inhibit IR-induced activation of AMPK and induction of p53 and p21 in A549 or induction of p21 alone in H1299 cells, showing\u2014once again\u2014IR induction of p21 in the absence of p53. In vehicle alone\u2013treated cells IR increased the proportion of cells in the G2/M phase from 13.6% \u00b1 2.16% to 28.0% \u00b1 4.7%, but AMPK knockdown reduced this population back to 11.3% \u00b1 3.2% (A, transfected cells). We investigated the effects of IR, CC, and metformin on A549 and H1299 cell clonogenic survival. CC alone (1 \u03bcmol/L) showed a trend to enhance but did not significantly affect basal clonogenic survival and caused resistance to IR by increasing SF2 to 66% \u00b1 9.8% and 67% \u00b1 2.9% in A549 and H1299 cells, respectively (D). However, it also significantly enhanced the IR activation of AMPK (C) and reduced SF2 further to 28% \u00b1 2.1% and 27% \u00b1 1.15% of control (40% inhibition of SF2 in both cell lines, D), offering at least an additive effect to that of IR. We i) explored the regulation of AMPK by IR in human epithelial cancer cells, ii) began analyzing upstream regulators of AMPK activation and downstream effectors, and iii) showed evidence of involvement of this enzyme in the IR-induced checkpoint control and clonogenic survival. Furthermore, using the biguanide metformin, we have shown that AMPK may be targeted pharmacologically to enhance the IR responses. The regulation of AMPK by therapeutic doses of IR was not examined earlier in cancer cells. Our results in lung, prostate, and breast cancer cells () suggest that activation of AMPK may be a universal effect of IR in human carcinomas. We observed rapid phosphorylation of nuclear AMPK in response to IR, in parallel with induction of the DSB marker \u03b3H2Ax (), but no convincing colocalization of the two markers, even at the early times after IR. In addition, we have not observed a modification of the subcellular distribution of total AMPK levels in response to IR (). IR activation of AMPK in both LKB1\u2013wild-type (H1299) and LKB1-null (A549) cells indicated that LKB1 is not required for activation of AMPK by IR. The concurrent phosphorylation of AMPK and H2Ax after IR suggested a relationship between AMPK activation and ATM. Consistent with other studies showing ATM-dependent activation of AMPK by Insulin-like Growth Factor-I (IGF-I) or AICAR , our results suggest that IR activates AMPK through an LKB1-independent and ATM-dependent pathway. We observed that IR rapidly increases the levels of p53 and p21 in lung cancer cells (C). In support of this notion, CC did not inhibit IR-induced ATM and Chk2 phosphorylation in A549 cells (). Our results suggest that AMPK regulates IR induction of p53 and p21 (C\u2013E). Future studies should clarify whether the IR induction of p53 and p21 expression is due to transcriptional regulation or protein stabilization. We observed a p53-independent induction of p21 by IR because it also increased p21 levels in p53-null H1299 cells (C and B). G2/M inter-phase arrest is a well-described IR-induced checkpoint . We expected that AMPK and p21 inhibition would abolish IR-induced arrest of the cell cycle at G2/M. In human cancer cells, IR activates AMPK in an LKB1-independent manner to (1) enhance the cellular levels of p53 and the CDK inhibitor p21, (2) regulate progression of cells through the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and (3) inhibit clonogenic survival. We also show that the anti-diabetic drug metformin can potentiate the IR activation of AMPK and enhance the cytotoxic effects of IR in cancer cells. AMPK appears to participate in a signaling pathway activated by IR that may be targetable by metformin to further enhance IR responses in human carcinomas.", "Thus, abrogation of the G checkpoint in cancer cells is a rational way to sensitize cells to IR and chemotherapeutic agents . Briefly, CNE1 and CNE2 cells were treated with cisplatin, cisplatin+G\u00f66976, IR, or IR+G\u00f66976 for 72h. Briefly, CNE1 and CNE2 cells were treated with cisplatin, cisplatin+G\u00f66976, IR, or IR+G\u00f66976 for 72h. CNE1 and CNE2 cells were treated with cisplatin, cispaltin+G\u00f66976, IR, or IR+G\u00f66976 for 72h. Using this model, we monitored the efficacy of G\u00f66976 alone (10mg/kg of body weight given by intraperitoneal injection every 2days), DMSO alone (100% DMSO, 40\u03bcL, intraperitoneal injection every 2days), IR alone (3Gy, every 2days), IR+G\u00f66976, cisplatin alone (5mg/kg of body weight by intraperitoneal injection every 2days), or cisplatin+G\u00f66976. CNE1 and CNE2 cells were treated with various clinical doses of IR in the presence of different concentrations of G\u00f66976. As shown in A, IR was readily cytotoxic to both CNE1 and CNE2 cells. The combination of IR and G\u00f66976 resulted in a higher level of cell death compared to treatment with IR alone. The effects of G\u00f66976 occurred in a dose-dependent manner, and inhibition was most significant when the cells were also exposed to 2Gy of IR. Furthermore, G\u00f66976 showed the most synergism with IR when it was administered for 12h following IR as compared to when it was administered for 0h and 24h after IR (B). Colony formation assays were used to further confirm that G\u00f66976 enhances the sensitivity of NPC cells to IR Both CNE1 and CNE2 cells formed fewer colonies when they were treated with G\u00f66976 (100nM) in the presence of different doses of IR compared to when the cells were treated with IR alone ( ). It is generally accepted that cancer cells treated with IR or cisplatin show reduced cell viability as a result of an increase in apoptosis. Thus, we examined whether G\u00f66976 promoted apoptosis in NPC cells that are treated with IR or cisplatin. CNE2 cells were treated with IR or cisplatin in the presence or absence of G\u00f66976 (100nM) for 72h. The percentage of cells positive for annexin V/PI was significantly increased following treatment with G\u00f66976 in combination with IR (2Gy or 10Gy) or cisplatin (IC) ( A). This indicates that G\u00f66976 promotes apoptosis in IR- or cisplatin-induced CNE2 cells. As shown in B, typical morphological changes, including chromatin condensation and apoptotic body formation, were observed in CNE2 cells when G\u00f66976 was combined with IR or cisplatin. Taken together, we conclude that G\u00f66976 may promote apoptosis in IR- or cisplatin-treated NPC cells. However, both cell types showed a prominent G/M arrest after IR treatment for 12h or 24h. This arrest was abolished when IR was combined with G\u00f66976. Interestingly, S- and G/M-phase arrest occurred in both cell lines following treatment with IR for 48h, and this arrest was abrogated by combining IR with G\u00f66976. p-Cdc2 was increased in CNE1 and CNE2 cells following treatment with IR or cisplatin for any tested lengths of time ( and B). These results are consistent with the cell cycle profiles that showed IR or cisplatin caused an S or G/M arrest that was abrogated by G\u00f66976 ( and B). Taken together, we conclude that IR or cisplatin inactivates Cdc2 to arrest cells at the S or G/M phase. We next examined the effect of G\u00f66976 on NPC xenografts in nude mice treated with IR or cisplatin In CNE2 xenograft-bearing mice, tumor volumes were smaller in the groups exposed to IR than in vehicle control (DMSO) groups. Strikingly, tumor volumes were significantly smaller in the group treated with a combination of G\u00f66976 and IR compared to those treated with IR alone ( =0.005). Many studies have shown that abrogation of the G checkpoint can potentiate cell death induced by IR and DNA-damaging agents . It is important to determine whether the Chk1 inhibitor G\u00f66976 can enhance the sensitivity of NPC cells exposed to IR or chemotherapeutics. We showed that G\u00f66976 enhanced the sensitivity of NPC cells exposed to IR or cisplatin in . Mechanistically, G\u00f66976 inhibited Chk1 activity, leading to reactivation of Cdc2 and abolishment of the intra-S and G/M checkpoints in NPC cells induced by IR or cisplatin. Notably, IR- and cisplatin-induced G/M arrest in CNE1 and CNE2 cells reached their peaks by 12h and gradually decreased by 24h and 48h. G\u00f66976 was the most effective when it was added after incubation with IR or cisplatin for 12h. G\u00f66976 is insoluble in water, thus G\u00f66976 absorbance may be much lower when simultaneously administrated with cisplatin compared to when it is administered alone or in combination with IR in mice. This may explain the difference in NPC xenograft results that occurred when mice were treated with G\u00f66976 in combination with IR or cisplatin The authors declare no conflicts of interest.", "The dynamics of these ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) have been implicated in DNA damage signaling and DNA repair. As an IRIF reporter, we tracked relocalization of GFP fused to a chromatin binding domain of the checkpoint adapter protein 53BP1 after IR of breast cancer cells and tumors. PARP inhibition markedly enhanced IRIF persistence and increased breast cancer cell senescence both Small molecules targeting cellular responses to DNA damage have long been considered an attractive strategy to improve the effectiveness of genotoxic cancer therapy ( Coincident with PARP1 recruitment, ATM-dependent phosphorylation of histone H2AX to form \u03b3H2AX at DSBs promotes further chromatin modifications and assembly of proteins at IRIF such as MRE11/RAD50/NBS1, MDC1, 53BP1, and BRCA1 ( Herein, by exploiting GFP fused to the chromatin-binding domain of 53BP1 as a live-cell imaging reporter for DSB repair, we monitored the effects of PARP inhibition on irradiated breast cancer cells both GFP fused to the human 53BP1 IRIF binding domain ( 17\u03b2-estradiol pellets (1.7 mg, Innovative Research of America) were implanted in female athymic Live-cell images were captured on an Olympus DSU spinning disk confocal microscope and back-thinned EMCCD camera controlled by Slidebook v4.2 software or Zeiss Axiovert 200M and The Hammatsu Orca ER FireWire digital monochrome camera controlled by OpenLab software. For IRIF imaging in tumors, we used a Leica SP5 Tandem Scanner Two-Photon Spectral Confocal System controlled by LAS-AF 2.0 software. Detailed methods regarding cell lines, shRNA knockdowns, qPCR gene expression analyses, BrdU incorporation, clonogenic assays, PI staining, \u03b3H2AX foci and 53BP1 localization to IRIF can serve as proxies for unrepaired DSBs and the DNA damage response ( Following induction with doxycycline, unirradiated MCF7 We examined IRIF formation and resolution in relation to IR dose and time in MCF7 Treating MCF7 ABT-888 alone slightly decreased colony formation at 10 \u03bcM (100 \u00b1 1% for control Unrepaired DNA damage can promote accelerated or premature senescence, even in cells with otherwise unlimited proliferative capacity ( To visualize IRIF Our data confirm previously reported enhancement of IR effects by PARP inhibition ( GFP-IBD reporter reveals IRIF formation and kinetics. PARP1 inhibitor ABT-888 (veliparib) alters IRIF dynamics and suppresses cell proliferation. ABT-888 induces accelerated senescence in irradiated MCF7 IR + ABT-888 induces persistent IRIF and senescence We acknowledge T. Halazonetis for generously providing reagents, and M. Pejovic, R. Torres and S. Bond for assistance.", "Twenty four hours post-transfection, cells were subjected to either mock or 10 Gy IR. Forty hours post-IR, cells were harvested, and apoptotic cells were stained using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Analysis of cleaved caspase 3, 8, or 9 was also performed in transfected cells as above subjected to either mock or 6 Gy IR. Forty-eight hours following IR, whole cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis for cleaved caspase 3, 8, or 9. We reasoned that compromised DNA repair by the expression of tr-BRCA1 would result in increased levels of persistent DSBs following IR. In these experiments, we examined IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX foci, a commonly used Given that integral cell survival processes such as DNA repair are dependent on nuclear BRCA1 ( If compromised DSB repair is the predominant underlying mechanism for tr-BRCA1-mediated sensitization of cells to DNA damage, then mutations that abolish BRCA1\u2019s repair function would similarly render cell susceptible to DNA damage. MCF7 cells with or without the ectopic expression of tr-BRCA1, which we have shown to induce BRCA1 cytosolic localization independent of DNA damage ( One potential mechanism by which BRCA1 subcellular localization controls DNA damage-induced cytotoxicity may be the previously reported role of cytoplasmic BRCA1 in the induction of apoptosis ( There are 2 major apoptotic processes, consisting of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways ( To further investigate the mechanism by which cytosolic BRCA1 mediates IR-induced apoptosis, cleavage of caspase 8 and 9 following IR was examined. Targeted translocation of BRCA1 to the cytoplasm suppressed BRCA1\u2019s function in DSB repair and conferred enhanced cytotoxicity to DNA damaging agents, including IR and cisplatin.", "We demonstrate for the first time that IR stimulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) up-regulation in endothelial cells (ECs), a HIF-1\u03b1-independent up-regulation of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), as well as endothelial migration, all of which are essential for angiogenesis. 5 Gray IR-induced EC HIF-1\u03b1 and SDF-1 expression was greater when combined with hypoxia suggesting an additive effect. While small interfering RNA silencing of HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA and abolition of HIF-1\u03b1 protein induction down-regulated SDF-1 induction by hypoxia alone, it had little effect on SDF-1 induction by IR, demonstrating an independent pathway. SDF-1-mediated EC migration in hypoxic and/or radiation-treated media showed IR induced strong SDF-1-dependent migration of ECs, augmented by hypoxia. IR activates a novel pathway stimulating EC migration directly through the expression of SDF-1 independent of HIF-1\u03b1 induction.", "Development of delayed IP against IR injury was assessed using partial IR in rat liver. Serum AST, ALT, and LDH levels were significantly increased by IR (4-, 5.6-, and 7.0-fold, respectively), with significant changes in liver histology, protein carbonyl/GSH ratio (481% enhancement), and serum TNF-alpha (6.1-fold increase). Delayed IP in IR animals reduced serum AST (66%), ALT (57%), and LDH (90%) and liver GSH depletion (89%), with normalization of protein carbonyl content, serum TNF-alpha levels, and liver histology. Enhanced AP-1/NF-kappaB DNA binding ratios and diminished haptoglobin expression induced by IR were normalized by IP. These data support that delayed IP suppresses IR-induced liver injury, oxidative stress, and TNF-alpha response, which coincide with recovery of IR-altered signaling functions represented by normal AP-1/NF-kappaB DNA binding ratios and acute phase responses.", "Application of IR spectroscopy to proteins has often targeted the amide bands as probes for gross structural change. This article focuses on the possibilities arising from recent IR technical developments for studies that monitor localized vibrational oscillators in proteins--native or exogenous ligands such as NO, CO, SCN(-) or CN(-), or genetically or chemically introduced probes with IR-active vibrations. These report on the electronic and coordination state of metals, the kinetics, intermediates and reaction pathways of ligand release, hydrogen-bonding interactions between the protein and IR probe, and the electrostatic character of sites in a protein. We can expect to see IR spectroscopy exploited, alongside other spectroscopies, and crystallography, to elucidate reactions of a wide range of metalloprotein chemistry with relevance to cell metabolism, health and energy catalysis.", "Lipid peroxidation, xanthine oxidase activity, myeloperoxidase activity and nitric oxide level in liver tissue were significantly increased ( Exenatide exerted protective effect on exaggerated remote organ (liver) injury induced by renal IR in diabetes. [ Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) play an important role in mediating cell damage during IR injury. [ Liver injury is one of the distant-organ damages induced by kidney IR. Differences were considered to be statistically significant when Diabetic rats that underwent renal IR exhibited significant increase in the serum concentrations of ALT, AST and ALP as compared to nondiabetic rats ( Effect of exenatide on liver function after renal IR in diabetic rats (a: alanine aminotransferase, b: aspartate aminotransferase, c: alkaline phosphatase). The MDA level was significantly increased in nondiabetic IR and in diabetic IR groups compared to normal control ( Effect of exenatide on lipid peroxidation (a), reduced glutathione (b), glutathione peroxidase (c), superoxide dismutase (d), catalase (e) and xanthine oxidase (f) in liver after renal IR in diabetic rats. The XO enzyme activity, one of the sources of ROS production, was significantly increased ( The level of NO was significantly increased in nondiabetic IR and diabetic IR groups in comparison with normal control group ( Effect of exenatide on nitric oxide (a), myeloperoxidase (b) and serum creatinine phosphokinase activity (c) after renal IR in diabetic rats. Myeloperoxidase activity, which is accepted to be an indicator of neutrophil infiltration, was significantly higher in the liver tissue of the diabetic IR group than in the liver tissue of the nondiabetic IR group ( Nondiabetic and diabetic rats demonstrated a a significant increase ( In the present study, ALT, AST and ALP activities did not increase after renal IR as much as a liver failure. However, their were statistically significant rise in the liver function enzymes after renal IR in diabetic rats as compared to nondiabetic rats, which indicated diminished liver function in diabetes as compared to normal state, which might be attributed to diabetes-potentate liver injury induced by renal IR. The present results indicated that renal IR caused distant-organ injury such as in the liver; it was exaggerated by diabetes, and exenatide treatment had a protective role against liver injury induced by renal IR. We found significantly higher MDA levels in the liver tissue of both nondiabetic and diabetic rats after induction of renal IR injury, which is a major index of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. This might be due to ROS production via inflammatory response; as inflammatory reactions are activated during the process of IR injury, resulting in the formation of inflammatory cytokines, like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and arachidonic acid metabolites. [ The cardiac MPO activity increased after renal IR, consistently with leukocyte infiltration and activation. The reaction of NO with O We found higher NO levels in diabetic IR rats in comparison with nondiabetic IR rats, which is the same as reported previously. [ The results of the present work demonstrated, exenatide treatment caused decrease in lipid peroxidation in liver tissue after renal IR. Several mechanisms might be responsible for the protective effects of exenatide against distant-organ injury induced by renal IR in diabetes; one of them, exenatide might reduce apoptosis and oxidative stress, as shown in our study. Exenatide is GLP-1 receptor agonist, and GLP-1 has been reported to protect the rat heart from IR injury, mediated by the pro-survival kinases PI3K/Akt, p42/44 PKA, and P70s6; in that, exenatide treatment caused increase in myocardial expression of pAkt, and expression of active caspase 3 was reduced. [ In conclusion, diabetes exaggerated liver damage induced by renal IR via oxidative stress and inflammatory process in STZ-NAD\u2013induced diabetes in rats. Also, the exenatide treatment attenuated liver injury induced by renal IR in diabetic rats. This is the first study in which exenatide was used to prevent liver injury induced by IR in diabetes, the prevention being shown to achieve via NO generation and neutrophil sequestration in the liver tissue.", "Here we examined the effects of chronic voluntary ethanol intake and naltrexone on FosB/\u0394FosB IR in striatal region and prefrontal cortex, and the effect of naltrexone on voluntary ethanol intake. We utilized immunohistochemistry to define the changes in FosB/\u0394FosB IR induced by chronic voluntary ethanol intake under a two-bottle intermittent access of 20% ethanol model and by systematic administration (intraperitoneal injection) of naltrexone in Sprague-Dawley rats. Chronic (15 drinking sessions in 35 days) voluntary ethanol intake robustly induces FosB/\u0394FosB IR in nucleus accumbens core, dorsolateral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex, but not in nucleus accumbens shell, dorsomedial striatum and medial prefrontal cortex. Systemic administration of naltrexone for six days significantly reduced voluntary ethanol consumption and FosB/\u0394FosB IR induced by chronic voluntary ethanol intake. Our results suggest that chronic voluntary ethanol intake induces FosB/\u0394FosB IR in a sub-region-specific manner and which involves activation of endogenous opioid system. Immunohistochemical results were analyzed using the Student\u2019s Given the dramatic induction of \u0394FosB in rodent brain in response to chronic passive ethanol exposure ( Chronic voluntary ethanol intakes significantly increased FosB/\u0394FosB IR in the NAc core ( The prefrontal cortex is responsible for the organization of behavior. Naltrexone treatments dramatically decreased FosB/\u0394FosB IR in the NAc core [ We reported here that chronic voluntary ethanol intake robustly induces FosB/\u0394FosB IR in NAc core, dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), but not in NAc shell, dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of S-D rats. This is somewhat different from a previous study showing that passive ethanol exposure induced high levels of \u0394FosB IR broadly within striatal complex and mPFC ( NAc core may contribute to conditioned stimulus-supported drug-seeking behavior ( OFC is a key brain region implicated in regulating goal-directed behavior and impulsivity ( Notably, the numbers of FosB/\u0394FosB positive cells in this study are significantly lower than the levels reported in a previous study ( The antiserum (#sc-48; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, California) used in our experiment was raised to the N terminus of FosB and recognizes both FosB and \u0394FosB. Schematic drawings of coronal sections of the rat brain based upon the atlas of Chronic voluntary ethanol intake significantly increases \u0394FosB IR within the NAc core (a\u2013b) and DLS (e\u2013f), but not in the NAc shell (c\u2013d) and DMS (g\u2013h). * Naltrexone treatment blocks ethanol-induced up-regulation of \u0394FosB IR in the striatal region and OFC.", "The human cell lines that are deficient in the DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) or ATM are sensitive to IR because of the inefficient DNA DSB repair To identify a miRNA that could efficiently target both (A) The putative To verify whether DNA-PKcs or ATM is a target of (A) Up-regulating To examine the effects of (A) The effect of up-regulation of To study whether (A) Tumor size reflected the effects of To study whether up-regulation of The field of small RNAs is rapidly developing toward All the mouse work was followed using the approved animal protocol according to the guidelines of Emory University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. After IR, the cells were collected and plated, aiming at a density of 20\u2013100 colonies per dish.", "DPN alone had only a significant E-like effect on gonadectomy cells and IR-PR, but not on GnRH self-priming. The finding that activation of ERbeta with its selective DPN agonist had an estrogenic effect on IR-PR nuclei, but not on GnRH self-priming, a characteristic ERalpha-mediated effect of E, suggests that the biological action of E at the pituitary may involve both isoforms of ER.", "The IR-induced increase of E2F4 levels led to an increase in E2F4 binding to p130 but had no effect on E2F4/p107 or E2F5/p130 complexes. The increase in E2F4/p130 association after IR was observed in prostate carcinoma cells regardless of their sensitivity to androgens, but not in breast carcinoma cells. Disruption of E2F4 through small interfering RNA prevented p130/E2F4 complex formation and sensitized cells to IR-induced apoptosis, leading to caspase-3 activation, cleavage of its substrate, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and nuclear condensation.", "However, IR-activated, ATM-mediated phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 (human) or 18 (mouse) [Ser15(h)/18(m)], and apoptosis occurred in myoblasts but was impaired in myotubes. Unexpectedly, the abundance of autophosphorylated ATM was indistinguishable after exposure of myotubes to IR (10 Gy) or doxorubicin (1 microM/24 h) despite efficient phosphorylation of p53 Ser15(h)/18(m), and apoptosis occurred only in response to doxorubicin. This mechanism appears to preserve IR-induced activation of the ATM-H2AX-MRE11/Rad50/Nbs1 lesion processing and repair pathway yet restrain ATM-p53-mediated apoptosis, thereby contributing to life-long maintenance of differentiated muscle tissues.", "These foci have been designated IR-induced nuclear foci (IRIFs) ( Abs specific for Ser139-phosphorylated histone H2A.X and Ser10-phosphorylated Histone H3 were purchased from Upstate. To examine the direct interaction between GST-RAD18 and KBD-HA For immunostaining of salt-resistant IR-induced 53BP1 foci, cells were exposed to 5 Gy of X-ray, harvested 1 h later, and then treated with 40 \u03bcg/ml cycloheximide. FRAP experiments were performed using a Leica TCS DMIRE2 confocal laser-scanning microscope with a 63\u00d7/1.32 HCX PLAPO CS objective (Leica, Mannheim, Germany). We previously showed that RAD18 relocalizes to form discrete nuclear foci, likely corresponding to sites of stalled replication, in response to a variety of genotoxic agents, including UV irradiation ( RAD18 foci colocalize with ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIFs). ( The histone variant H2AX is instantly phosphorylated at chromatin regions flanking DSBs, and the number of phosphorylated H2AX (\u03b3-H2AX) foci in cells reflects the number of DSBs ( In response to DSB formation, various proteins are recruited to the regions flanking the breaks to form IRIFs containing NBS1, phospho-ATM, BRCA1 and 53BP1 ( We next examined IR-induced RAD18 focus formation in various human cell lines defective for IRIF component proteins. The similar kinetics with which RAD18 and 53BP1 foci formed following IR-treatment prompted us to examine whether 53BP1 is required for the IR-induced formation of RAD18 foci. More than 90% of the 53BP1 was depleted within 24 h of siRNA treatment, and the level of depletion was sustained for at least 72 h. The level of RAD18 was unaffected by 53BP1 depletion ( IR-induced RAD18 focus formation requires 53BP1. ( Next, to examine whether RAD18 IRIF formation is dependent on the presence of 53BP1 or cell-cycle status, confluent wt and 53BP1-null mouse cells were synchronized at G1 and then irradiated with X-rays ( The 53BP1-dependent RAD18 IRIF formation is restricted to G1-phase. We expressed a series of recombinant fusion proteins consisting of 53BP1 fragments with N-terminal GST tags in bacteria and partially purified them using Glutathione beads ( Since the kinetochore-binding domain (KBD) of 53BP1 harbors a minimal region for focus formation after exposure to X-rays ( Next, we sought to identify the region within RAD18 that is required for its recruitment to IRIFs and its interaction with 53BP1. To determine the region of RAD18 required for IRIF formation, we transfected Since our results showed that RAD18 directly associates with 53BP1 A RAD18\u2013RAD6 complex mediates monoubiquitination of 53BP1 We next tested whether RAD18C207F, which does not interact with 53BP1, could also monoubiquitinate the KBD fragment. As shown in In the cellular response to IR, the exposure of methylated histones is required for the initial recruitment of 53BP1 to DSBs ( We hypothesized that the modification of 53BP1 itself by RAD18 may influence the proper localization of 53BP1 in response to IR, possibly contributing to its association with chromatin in the vicinity of DSBs. To assess this possibility, we determined the number of wt and To this end, cycloheximide was added to the cells 1 h after irradiation to block In both wt and The stability of IR-induced 53BP1 foci is affected by RAD18. Chicken DT40 cells deficient in 53BP1 have increased sensitivity to IR in G1-early S phase, whereas HR plays only a modest role in DSB repair and cell survival ( Divergent responses of 53BP1- and Rad18-deficient DT40 cells to X or UV irradiation. ( To assess whether retention of 53BP1 at DSBs and putative monoubiquitination of 53BP1 plays a role in DSB repair during G1, the number of \u03b3-H2AX foci at 24 h post-IR was counted in G1-enriched Finally, to evaluate whether Rad18 is involved in DSB repair during G1 phase, we examined the IR-sensitivity of a G1-enriched population of mouse cells treated with the DNA-PKcs inhibitor NU7026. Because 53BP1 was dispensable for IRIF of RAD18 during S- or G2/M phase, molecules other than 53BP1 will likely interact with RAD18 following completion of G1. Previous studies have shown that the zinc finger is required for accumulation of hRAD18 at sites of DNA damage ( In the early response to IR, local changes in chromatin structure are required for the initial recruitment of 53BP1 to DSBs. We speculate that both mono- and poly-ubiquitinaiton of 53BP1 function cooperatively in the initial recuruitment and retention of 53BP1 IRIF at DSBs.", "Ex vivo studies have demonstrated the cardioprotective anti-inflammatory effect of the cannabinoid type 2 (CB2) receptor agonists within hours after IR. Herein, we evaluated the in vivo effect of CB2 receptors on IR-induced cell death, fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction and investigated the target role of cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts. The infarct size was increased 24 h after IR in CB2(-/-) vs. wild-type (WT) hearts and decreased when WT hearts were injected with the CB2 agonist JWH133 (3 mg/kg) at reperfusion. Compared with WT hearts, CB2(-/-) hearts showed widespread injury 3 d after IR, with enhanced apoptosis and remodeling affecting the remote myocardium. Finally, CB2(-/-) hearts exhibited exacerbated fibrosis, associated with left ventricular dysfunction 4 wk after IR, whereas their WT counterparts recovered normal function. Therefore, CB2 receptor activation may protect against post-IR heart failure through direct inhibition of cardiac myocyte and fibroblast death and prevention of myofibroblast activation.", "Insulin action begins with insulin receptor auto-phosphorylation, then causing phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, leading to activation of a number of intracellular processes, with a decrease in the ability of the insulin receptor to tyrosine phosphorylate IRS-1 in insulin resistance. PTP dephosphorylates the IR, returning it to the inactive state, with inhibition of IR-PTP prolonging the insulin signal. Mice not expressing this enzyme display remarkable tissue specificity of insulin sensitivity, with a reduction in fed blood glucose, a 50% lowering of insulin levels, and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR in muscle and liver, without effect in adipose tissue, leading to resistance to diet-induced obesity ( Santilli et al.", "Although IR-induced mitochondrial injury has been extensively studied and key mitochondrial functions affected by IR are chiefly characterized, the nature of the molecule that causes loss of mitochondrial integrity and function remains obscure. It has become increasingly clear that ceramide, a membrane sphingolipid and a key mediator of cell-stress responses could play a critical role in IR-induced mitochondrial damage. Emerging data point to excessive ceramide accumulation in tissue and, specifically, in mitochondria after IR. Exogenously added to isolated mitochondria, ceramide could mimic some of the mitochondrial dysfunctions occurring in IR. The recent identification and characterization of major enzymes in ceramide synthesis is expected to contribute to the understanding of molecular mechanisms of ceramide involvement in mitochondrial damage in IR. This review will examine the experimental evidence supporting the important role of ceramide in mitochondrial dysfunction in IR in order to highlight potential targets for pharmacological manipulation of ceramide levels. Most of the experimental evidence indicating the important roles of ceramides containing distinct fatty acids is summarized in an excellent review by Futerman and his colleagues [ In In a very interesting study, analysis of cardiac tissues from mice subjected to IR revealed significant elevation of ceramide and inhibition of sphingosine kinase 1 activity ( Recently, increases of specific ceramide species in the rat heart were investigated after 30 min global ischemia/30 min reperfusion. IR increased accumulation of only 7 out of 14 ceramide species identified in the heart [ In mild IR, ceramide accumulation resulted from Ceramide was elevated in injured liver tissue after cold ischemia and warm reperfusion during liver transplantation [ In the whole kidney IR model, ceramide content was increased about 1.8-fold in the injured tissue during the reperfusion phase [ Irrespective of the type of IR, IR-related physiological events have a common final consequence: alteration of mitochondrial function and release of mitochondrial proteins, leading to cell death. Cells with hallmarks of necrosis or apoptosis have been detected in animal models of IR [ Several lines of evidence have implicated changes in mitochondrial function as an intermediate step in transduction of ceramide signals that culminate in apoptotic or necrotic cell death [ Depending on cell type and stimuli, ceramide can alter mitochondrial function indirectly or directly ( Among non-protein indirect pathways, those associated with Ca Evidence is also accruing to implicate a direct action of ceramide on mitochondria. GD3 shares with ceramide the same properties with respect to its effects on isolated mitochondria and mitochondria Another pro-apoptotic ceramide derivative, sphingosine, releases cytochrome c from mitochondria that could be inhibited by over-expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL [ Continued research efforts are required to better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of IR injury, to identify and test new protective agents. Since many assumptions regarding ceramide functions in IR-induced tissue injury were based on We apologize to colleagues for not citing all of the important publications owing to space constrains.", "We examined the effect of hyperoxia on enterocyte turnover and intestinal preservation and rehabilitation following IR injury in rats. Animals were assigned to four experimental groups: 1) Sham rats underwent laparotomy without vascular occlusion and breathed air, 2) Sham-oxygen rats underwent laparotomy without vascular occlusion and breathed 100% oxygen, 3) IR rats underwent occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery and portal vein for 30 minutes and breathed air, and 4) IR group treated with oxygen (IR-O2)rats underwent IR and breathed 100% oxygen starting 10 minutes before and continued for the first 6 hours after reperfusion. Intestinal structural changes, enterocyte proliferation, and enterocyte apoptosis were determined 24 hours after IR. In IR rats, breathing 100% oxygen resulted in a significant decrease in Park's injury score in the ileum (p < 0.05 from untreated IR rats). Enterocyte proliferation (assessed by bromodeoxyuridine uptake) was significantly decreased in the jejunum and ileum in untreated IR rats. Plasma thermochemiluminescence oxidizability assay revealed significantly higher thermochemiluminescence ratios in IR group treated with oxygen than in untreated IR rats (p < 0.05) at 6 hours postreperfusion suggesting a significantly lower prior in vivo molecular oxidation. Hyperoxia reduces small bowel injury, accelerates enterocyte turnover, and improves intestinal rehabilitation after IR.", "In normal mice, CR increased the insulin stimulated activation of the insulin signaling cascade (IR/IRS/PI3K/AKT) in liver and muscle. In the muscle of GHRKO mice, there was elevated downstream activation of the insulin signaling cascade (IRS/PI3K/AKT) in the absence of elevated IR activation. Further, we found a major reduction of inhibitory Ser phosphorylation of IRS-1 seen exclusively in GHRKO muscle which may underpin their elevated insulin sensitivity. To determine the molecular mechanism of differential impact of CR on insulin sensitivity in normal mice and GHRKO mice, we evaluated insulin signal transduction through the IR/IRS/PI3K/AKT1/AKT2 pathway in liver and skeletal muscle in normal and GHRKO mice fed AL or subjected to CR for one year in response to an insulin challenge (10 IU/kg insulin versus saline). In normal mice, CR significantly increased insulin-induced p85/IRS pY99 phosphorylation from 1.8-fold (N AL) to 2.2-fold in (N CR). Skeletal muscle is the major site of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in the body, as demonstrated by various tissue-specific knockouts of the glucose transporter GLUT4 Levels of total insulin receptor (IR; A), IR pY1158 (B), AKT1 (D), and AKT1 pS473 (E) were determined using ELISA. Liver homogenates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-p85, separated using SDS-PAGE and the level of non-specific Tyr phosphorylation was determined at approximately 180 kDa (corresponding to IRS proteins) using anti-pY99 (C). Calorie restriction produced a significant increase in the PI3K/IRS phosphorylation of IRS associated with PI3K in the muscle of normal mice, yet did not further elevate the already heightened phospho-Tyr levels in the GHRKO mice ( AKT proteins in skeletal muscle are critically involved in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake through the trafficking of GLUT4 to the cell surface. In normal mice, CR increased total AKT1 protein (N AL 11.2\u00b10.94 versus N CR 16.4\u00b12.0, P<0.01, As mentioned previously, AKT2 has been shown to mediate the stimulatory effects of CR on improved glucose uptake in skeletal muscle Muscle GLUT4 total protein levels were significantly increased by CR in normal mice (P<0.003, A number of recent reports show that Ser/Thr kinases mTOR, JNK, and PKC\u03b6 mediate a negative feedback loop in the insulin signaling cascade by phosphorylating IRS-1 at Ser position 307 Bars represent 6\u20138 animals per phenotype/diet group. ELISA for insulin (CrystalChem, Downers Grove, IL), IR, IR pY1158, IRS-1, IRS-1 pS312, AKT1 and AKT1 pS473 were used for quantification of cellular proteins in accordance with manufacturer's instructions (Biosource Camarillo, CA). Non-specific IRS Tyr phosphorylation of p85 was determined by detecting anti-pY99 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) signal in \u223c180 kDa region in the anti-pan p85 immunoprecipitates.", "", "E2 administration did not change IR substrate 1 (IRS-1) protein content and tyrosine phosphorylation, while decreased mRNA content and increased its association with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). E2 decreased protein and mRNA content of IR substrate 2 (IRS-2), while did not change IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and IRS-2 association with p85. The increase of IRS-1/p85 is accompanied by increase of p85 protein and mRNA levels, and by stimulation of protein kinase B (Akt) Ser(473) phosphorylation. In summary, although in some aspects cardiac insulin signaling is obviously improved by E2 treatment (increase of p85 mRNA and protein levels, enhancement of IRS-1/p85 association and Ser(473)Akt phosphorylation), the observed decrease of IR tyrosine phosphorylation, IRS-2 protein content, and IRSs mRNA contents, suggest very complex interplay of beneficial and suppressive effects of E2, both genomic and non-genomic, in regulation of heart insulin signaling.", "IR in HIV-positive patients does not seem to represent a significant independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease; nevertheless, the association with other metabolic complications (dyslipidemia, fat redistribution) and CMS may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The use of nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors is associated with the development of upper trunk and visceral fat accumulation and may cause IR. The progression of IR toward diabetes may be impeded with the choice of HAART regimens with less IR effects and encouraging patients to adhere to a healthy lifestyle. For patients with marked IR but relatively preserved fat, the use of metformin may consent the improvement of CMS and lipodystrophy, especially when combined with an appropriate exercise program.", "Frequencies of telomere-telomere fusion remained essentially zero in cells derived from both mouse strains, indicating no overt telomere uncapping is occurring following IR. However, the frequency of telomere- DSB fusion in BALB/c epithelial cells increased at 12 PD following IR and remained elevated through 18 PD, whereas C57BL/6 levels remained at baseline ( We also examined telomere dysfunction in two immortalized subclones clones (6-1 and 6-2), which were isolated from an altered growth variant (IRO) that emerged from a population of irradiated BALB/c mammary epithelial cells ( Maintenance of genomic stability obligates cells to correctly distinguish between and properly process two very different types of double-stranded DNA ends, telomeres and DSBs. The BALB/c mouse provided an especially relevant model in this regard, as it possesses partial deficiency of DNA-PKcs due to two SNPs in We conclusively demonstrate that uncapped telomeres in DNA-PKcs deficient backgrounds mistakenly fuse to IR-induced DSBs, supporting our hypothesis that such dysfunctional telomeres behave as DSBs. BALB/c mammary fibroblasts and epithelial cells exhibit telomere-DSB fusions following IR exposure that increase in frequency in a dose-dependent manner. The presence of TIFs in BALB/c irrespective of IR exposure reveals inherent telomere instability, providing evidence that the cell improperly identifies uncapped telomeres in this background as DSBs, then misjoins them to either other uncapped telomeres (spontaneous telomere fusion), or to IR-induced DSBs (telomere-DSB fusion). While there has been some discrepancy as to the reported frequencies of these events, with immortalization status and manner of DNA-PKcs depletion among the contributing factors to these inconsistencies, telomere fusions have consistently been reported in DNA-PKcs-deficient backgrounds ( In the present study, we expand our characterization of DNA-PKcs-deficient telomere dysfunction by examining the relationship between telomere uncapping and IR-induced genomic instability, a key intermediate process on the path of tumorigenesis. To this end, we utilized primary mammary epithelial cells derived from the DNA-PKcs-deficient BALB/c mouse, which experiences increased IR-induced genomic instability and susceptibility to mammary tumorigenesis, and, as we demonstrate here, telomere uncapping. We also find evidence of delayed formation of telomere-DSB fusion, suggestive of a role for these events in on-going IR-induced genomic instability. Telomere-DSB fusion may perpetuate instability in several ways including resulting in an \u201copen\u201d DSB end ( While telomere shortening has been associated with radiosensitivity, instability and cancer, here we provide the first evidence that telomere uncapping associated with even partial DNA repair deficiency may be involved in driving IR-induced instability and thus carcinogenesis via inappropriate telomere-DSB fusion. Analysis of consequence and time course for expression of telomere-DSB fusion and IR-induced genomic instability is suggestive of a role for telomere dysfunction in driving this instability.", "As a result, the \u03b3-H2AX domain can extend on the order of a megabase in length and can be detected as IR-induced subnuclear foci in immunofluorescence microscopy . Cancer-causing mutations within its BRCT repeats that are known to disrupt phosphopeptide-binding abrogate BRCA1 accumulation into IR-induced foci, indicating that BRCA1 binding to phosphorylated partners is a critical step in the recruitment of BRCA1 to DNA lesions . Like BRCA1, RAP80 accumulates into IR-induced foci in an MDC1- and \u03b3-H2AX-dependent manner . As a consequence of this reduction in ubiquitylation at sites of DNA damage, BRCA1 failed to accumulate into IR-induced foci. Remarkably, RNF8 is critical for the relocalization of BRCA1 into IR-induced foci . RNF8 rapidly accumulates into IR-induced foci that colocalize with \u03b3-H2AX . At the level of the RNF8 protein, its FHA domain, but not its RING finger, is necessary for formation of RNF8 IR-induced foci. Mutation of these motifs abolishes interaction with RNF8 and results in a phenocopy of the phenotype imparted by RNF8 depletion, which include an impaired formation of ubiquitin conjugates and 53BP1 IR-induced foci . Examination of IR-induced histone ubiquitylation is complicated by the fact that H2A mono-ubiquitylation acts as a repressive histone mark and there is a relatively high background of histone ubiquitylation, estimated to be in the order of 10\u201315% of all H2A . In particular, \u03b3-H2AX ubiquitylation is RNF8-, MDC1- and UBC13-dependent; strongly suggesting that IR-induced ubiquitylation of H2A-type histones is dependent on the RNF8\u2013UBC13 complex . Not surprisingly, depletion of RNF8 results in an impaired G2/M checkpoint at low doses of IR and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation , indicating that the RNF8-dependent response is important for the ability of cells to cope with DSBs. Moreover, ubiquitin conjugates are not detected in IR-induced foci, indicating that RIDDLE cells are defective in DNA damage-induced regulatory ubiquitylation. Since MDC1 and NBS1 IR-induced focus formation remain unaffected in these cells , these phenotypes were found to be strikingly similar to those imparted by depletion of RNF8 (see ). RNF168 was discovered in a genome-wide RNA interference screen that examined the ability of siRNAs to impair IR-induced 53BP1 focus formations . Importantly, introduction of wild-type RNF168 into RIDDLE cells restored radioresistance as well as 53BP1, ubiquitin conjugate and BRCA1 IR-induced focus formation . This observation, coupled with the finding that RNF168 IR-induced focus formation is entirely dependent on the presence of the RNF8 RING finger, suggests that RNF8\u2013UBC13 catalyzes a ubiquitylation event at DSBs that is necessary for subsequent RNF168 recruitment . Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that RNF168 physically interacts with uH2A in an IR-, MIU- and RNF8-dependent manner . Importantly, localization of RNF168 at DNA lesions is critical for its function in the DSB response as mutation of the MIU motifs greatly impaired the ability of RNF168 to promote the formation of 53BP1 IR-induced foci . Surprisingly, like RNF8, RNF168 is necessary for the formation of uH2A IR-induced foci , is able to ubiquitylate H2A (but not H2B and H3) in vitro , and its depletion resulted in the downregulation of H2A and H2AX ubiquitylation after IR . Firstly, in RIDDLE cells, the behavior of BRCA1 and 53BP1 is not identical in terms of IR-induced focus formation. Indeed, whereas 53BP1 foci are totally abrogated at all time points after IR in the absence of RNF168, BRCA1 focus formation can be detected with considerably delayed kinetics, 6\u20138h after irradiation . In addition, although K63-linked ubiquitin chains are clearly produced in an RNF8- and RNF168-dependent manner after IR, we have so fair failed to detect histone H2A K63-linked polyubiquitylation in chromatin. USP3 overexpression leads to a reduction of steady-state uH2A levels and, strikingly, abrogates the formation of uH2A IR-induced foci. Importantly, knockdown of USP3 by RNA interference results in a persistence of uH2A IR-induced foci indicating that USP3 may play a physiological role in deubiquitylating the products of RNF8 and RNF168. They found that USP3 overexpression does not affect RNF8 accumulation at sites of DNA damage but rather prevents RNF168 focus formation after IR .", "Extra-adipose accumulation of lipid, particularly within the liver and skeletal muscle, is closely linked with the development of IR. Through its effects to increase fatty acid oxidation and inhibit lipogenesis, AMPK activity in the liver and skeletal muscle could be expected to ameliorate lipid accumulation and associated IR in these tissues. In addition, we consider the arguments for and against the hypothesis that dysfunctional AMPK contributes to IR.", "Flavopiridol-treated embryos demonstrated a twofold increase in mortality after exposure to 40 Gy by 96 hpf and developed distinct radiation-induced defects in midline development (designated as the \"curly up\" phenotype) at higher rates when compared with embryos receiving IR only. Cyclin D1-deficient embryos had virtually identical IR sensitivity profiles when compared with embryos treated with flavopiridol. This was particularly evident for the IR-induced curly up phenotype, which was greatly exacerbated by both flavopriridol and cyclin D1 downregulation.", "However, at this moment no data are available about the role of ADMA and IR to induce endothelial dysfunction in an independent way or combined between them. In this study, we investigated, in 63 hypertensives and 21 normotensive healthy subjects, the relationship between ADMA and IR and their possible interaction on endothelial function. ADMA plasma levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, and IR by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). The association between ADMA and IR contributes to identify a possible novel mechanism by which ADMA promotes vascular damage, increasing individual cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients.", "Activation of insulin and IGF signaling pathways was studied by analysis of the phosphorylation status of IGF-IR and of key signaling proteins of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MAP kinase pathways, by the use of specific PI3K and MAP kinase inhibitors, and by silencing of IR and IGF-IR. Lantus stimulated the growth of MCF7 cells, which show high IGF-IR/IR ratio, significantly at 0.3 nmol/l, while regular insulin (Actrapid and bovine insulin) and other insulin analogs (Novorapid, Humalog, and Levemir) stimulated cell growth at 1.5-15 nmol/l concentrations. No difference between Lantus and the other insulin analogs was observed regarding growth stimulation of MCF10A cells showing low IGF-IR/IR ratio. Growth stimulation of MCF7 cells by Lantus was mainly due to strong activation of the IGF-IR and the MAP kinase pathway. Regular insulin and other insulin analogs tested activated mainly the IR and the PI3K/Akt pathway. We conclude that unlike regular insulin and other insulin analogs, Lantus strongly activates the IGF-IR and the MAP kinase pathway in MCF7 cells and is a strong mitogen for cells characterized by a high-IGF-IR/IR ratio.", "In this work, we show that high linear energy transfer (LET) IR induces apoptosis in a non-small cell lung cancer cell line, U-1810, whereas low LET IR does not. PSE was applied to study changes in pathway status between high and low LET IR to find pathway candidates of importance for high LET-induced apoptosis. Based on the proteomics data, PSE suggested the JNK pathway (p = 6.10(-6)) as a key event in response to high LET IR. Antibody-based analyses confirmed that high LET IR caused an increase in phosphorylation of JNK. In contrast, neither an activation of p38 nor a role for p38 in high LET IR-induced apoptotic signaling was found. We conclude that, in contrast to conventional low LET IR, high LET IR can trigger activation of the JNK pathway, which in turn is critical for induction of apoptosis in these cells.", "Furthermore, EGCG inhibited the association of IR with the IRS1 and IRS2 proteins, but not with the IRS4 protein. These data suggest that EGCG selectively affects particular types of IRS and MAPK family members. Pretreatment of preadipocytes with 67LR antiserum prevented the effects of EGCG on insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS2, RAF1, and ERK1/2 and insulin-stimulated preadipocyte proliferation (cell number and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation). Moreover, EGCG tended to increase insulin-stimulated associations between the 67LR and IR, IRS1, IRS2, and IRS4 proteins.", "For example, low-dose IR exposure to HL-60 cells induces their apoptosis and granulocytic differentiation In the present study, we demonstrated that the downregulation of rRNA levels by the Act D treatment or TIF-IA KD induced the differentiation of leukemia cell lines and mouse hematopoietic cells ( A recent study reported similar results during Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) were purchased from Wako.", "Therefore, the hypothesis that sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) directly interacts with \u03b2-catenin was tested and whether this interaction alters the expression of Wnt target genes to produce an altered cellular phenotype. Co-immunoprecipitation studies, using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Sirt2 wild-type and genomic knockout mice, demonstrate that \u03b2-catenin directly binds SIRT2. Additionally, this association inhibits the expression of important Wnt target genes like survivin (BIRC5), cyclin D1 (CCND1), and c-myc (MYC). Together, these data demonstrate that SIRT2, a tumor suppressor lost in multiple cancers, inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway in non-malignant cells by binding to \u03b2-catenin and that SIRT2 plays a critical role in the response to oxidative stress from radiation. The Wnt signaling pathway is crucial in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and differentiation ( Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) belongs to the family of sirtuins which are NAD+-dependent class III protein deacetylases, and have been shown to play a major role in metabolism and longevity. SIRT2 expresses mainly in the brain, particularly the hippocampus and oligodendrocytes. SIRT2 is reported to deacetylate \u03b1-tubulin, thereby regulating microtubule dynamics. Consequently, SIRT2 is proposed to play a role in mitotic checkpoint to maintain genomic integrity ( In this study we show that SIRT2 directly interacts with \u03b2-catenin, and the interaction increases following IR exposure. Genetic deletion of Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from wild type and Mouse Cells were exposed to IR in an X-Rad 320 biological irradiator (Precision X-ray, Inc.), at a dose rate of 2.1 Gy/min. The following antibodies were purchased: SIRT2 (Sigma), \u03b2-catenin, cyclin D1, c-jun and survivin (Santa Cruz), phospho-\u03b2-catenin Y142 (Abcam), GSK3\u03b2 and pGSK3\u03b2 (BD Biosciences), acetylated lysine, acetylated \u03b2-catenin, MMP-9, E-cadherin, Akt, pAkt (Ser473) and c-myc (Cell Signaling). We used two-tailed Student Since transcriptionally active \u03b2-catenin accumulates in the nucleus, we first determined the subcellular localization of \u03b2-catenin in wild-type (WT) Immunofluorescence analysis of Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin at tyrosine residue 142 correlates with an increase in nuclear \u03b2-catenin-dependent gene expression ( To determine whether SIRT2 interacts with \u03b2-catenin, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using cell lysates from To test whether the association between SIRT2 and \u03b2-catenin can be modulated, we exposed ROS are a well-known by-product of IR exposure, and ROS levels correlate to DNA damage that ultimately leads to cell mortality. We examined the differences in ROS levels in the presence and absence of SIRT2 at baseline and following a single exposure to 10 Gy ( To determine whether PEG-cat is capable of protecting the cells from IR-induced cell death by scavenging H Acetylated \u03b2-catenin has been shown to play a role in oncogenesis due to increasing \u03b2-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity ( To verify that SIRT2 directly deacetylates \u03b2-catenin, we performed GSK3\u03b2 is a negative upstream regulator of \u03b2-catenin in the Wnt pathway. Activation of the Wnt pathway inhibits GSK3\u03b2, allowing \u03b2-catenin to accumulate and translocate into the nucleus to turn on gene expression ( Given that loss of SIRT2 was demonstrated to activate the Wnt pathway, we investigated whether genomic loss and knockdown of endogenously expressed To verify that increased expression of Wnt target genes in the absence of SIRT2 occurs at the transcriptional level, we examined the effect of SIRT2 on \u03b2-catenin-mediated transcription using TOPFLASH luciferase reporter analysis ( Furthermore, we examined the effect of SIRT2 on the recruitment of \u03b2-catenin to TCF-binding sites of Wnt target genes by ChIP ( Microtubules have also been shown to be required for cell migration and tail retraction ( To further verify the effect of SIRT2 on invasive capacity, we performed invasion assays using Given that migration and invasion of MEFs were determined to be a SIRT2 dependent phenomenon, we examined if the capacity of the cell to invade extracellular matrix was also dependent on SIRT2. Previous studies have shown that matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) ( Because we observed a difference in adherence property between Recent developments implicate SIRT2 as a major player in several diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we describe a tumor suppressive role for SIRT2 using wild type and knockout In accordance with increased active \u03b2-catenin in the absence of SIRT2, we showed that TCF/LEF transcription factor activity increased. Furthermore, ChIP analysis demonstrated that the presence of SIRT2 significantly attenuates \u03b2-catenin\u2019s binding to upstream promoter regions of Our findings place SIRT2 as the second sirtuin to interact with \u03b2-catenin and regulate its transcriptional activity. Firestein Here, we connect endogenous SIRT2 to the interaction between the processes of aging, response to extracellular stress by IR exposure, de-differentiation and carcinogenesis. Nuclear \u03b2-catenin levels are elevated in SIRT2 interacts directly with \u03b2-catenin. A, coimmunoprecipitation showing association of SIRT2 and \u03b2-catenin increases with IR. Acetylation of \u03b2-catenin and activation of the Wnt signaling pathway in SIRT2 inhibits Wnt target gene expression. A, real-time PCR showing upregulated mRNA levels of SIRT2 inhibits Wnt Signaling. A, pTOPFLASH luciferase promoter analysis showing upregulated TCF/LEF transcriptional activity in SIRT2 inhibits cell motility/invasion and MMP9 expression and upregulates E-cadherin expression. A, cell motility analysis showing Disruption of the SIRT2/\u03b2-catenin interaction represents an endogenous therapeutic target to prevent transformation and preserve the integrity of aging cells against exogenous stressors such as reactive oxygen species.", "Based on the importance of EGFR in SCCHN progression, we hypothesized that Dacomitinib would effectively reduce tumor viability and enhance IR cytotoxicity in SCCHN models. Herein, we present the first evaluation of Dacomitinib with IR in both All animal experiments were conducted in accordance to guidelines of the Animal Care Committee (ACC) at the University Health Network (Toronto, Canada). Three human SCCHN cell lines were utilized: FaDu (hypopharyngeal squamous carcinoma; American Type Culture Collection), UT-SCC-8 and UT-SCC-42a (laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma); the latter two lines were a generous gift from R. Grenman (Department of Otorhinolaryntology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of Turku, Finland) Dacomitinib was provided by Pfizer Canada, Inc. For Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 3\u00d710 For The soluble tetrazolium salt [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethonyphenol)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS); Promega Corp.] cell proliferation assay was used to assess Dacomitinib cytotoxicity, with or without IR. As shown in (A to D) Growth inhibition of three SCCHN and the NOE cell lines, treated with Dacomitinib, with or without IR. (B) FaDu; (C) UT-SCC-8; (D) UT-SCC-42a; and (E) NOE cells were treated with Dacomitinib (0, 10, 25, 50, 100, or 250 nM) alone, or in combination with IR (0, 2, or 4 Gy). To elucidate the mode of cytotoxicity of Dacomitinib, cell cycle analyses were performed on SCCHN cell lines treated with Dacomitinib (10 or 100 nM), either alone or in combination with IR (2 or 4 Gy). Forty-eight hours following Dacomitinib treatment, there was a dose-dependent increase in the population of cells in G0/G1, along with a corresponding reduction in the proportion of cells in the S and G2/M phases, again observed across all three SCCHN cell lines (Figure S4 in (A-C) FaDu, UT-SCC-8, and UT-SCC-42a cells were treated with negative control (DMSO), Dacomitinib (100 nM), IR (4 Gy), or Dacomitinib plus IR (100 nM; 4 Gy). *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001; Student's To further elucidate the mechanism of Dacomitinib-induced cytotoxicity To assess the pre-clinical efficacy of Dacomitinib in combination with IR (A) FaDu-bearing mice were randomized to: (i) DMSO control; (ii) Dacomitinib (5 mg/kg/d) delivered orally on days 1 to 5; (iii) local tumor irradiation (IR; 2 Gy/treatment) delivered on days 2 and 5; or (iv) Dacomitinib plus IR. ***p<0.001, negative control Immunohistochemical analyses of the xenograft tumors were performed to determine if the observed This is the first report evaluating the potential role of Dacomitinib for the treatment of SCCHN in combination with IR. In SCCHN, nearly all tumors harbour EGFR over-expression, the extent of which relate to resistance to chemotherapy and/or radiation, leading to decreased survival Inhibition of EGFR has been examined extensively for the treatment of SCCHN, with previous reports concluding that EGFR is an attractive therapeutic target Given that RT is a primary curative modality for SCCHN, the effects of Dacomitinib with IR were examined; consistently demonstrating a synergistic interaction One of the persistent challenges to targeting EGFR has been the intrinsic or acquired resistance to current EGFR inhibitors, linked to a variety of mechanisms.", "In this study, we sought to determine if the molecular interaction between CR and IR could be mediated by microRNA (miR). miR arrays revealed 3 miRs in the miR-17~92 cluster as most significantly down regulated when CR is combined with IR. In vivo, CR and IR down regulated miR-17/20 in 2 TNBC models. Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) account for almost 20 % of breast malignancies and are defined by a lack of hormone receptors, an aggressive nature, and poor prognosis, including high recurrence rates with short intervals to recurrence [ We have previously demonstrated that CR in combination with IR causes an additive tumor regression in two in vivo models of TNBC [ Human TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells and mouse TNBC 4T1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, CA) at 37 \u00b0C under 5 % CO2 in humidified air. A PanTak 320 kVp X-RAD (Pantak, CT) was used for IR treatment. To evaluate the effect of caloric restriction on metastatic growth, we randomized mice into 4 treatment groups: (1) controls with an ad libitum diet (AL), (2) radiation to the primary tumor (8 Gy dose IR), (3) 30 % reduction in caloric intake (CR), or (4) a combination of CR and IR. Before randomization, all mice were injected with 50,000 4T1 cells into the #4 mammary fat pad [ MicroRNAs microarray profiling was performed using total RNA extracted from three tumors from each of the four treatment groups: AL, CR, AL+IR, and CR+IR. The relative expression was generated using the equation 2 The ANOVA analysis was used to compare 4 groups: AL, AL+IR, CR, and CR+IR in miR array data. The cDNA array data were analyzed by GO-Elite [ In two in vivo models of TNBC, we have previously shown [ Results from this study revealed significantly decreased expression levels of both miR-17 and miR-20a when CR was combined with IR ( To determine the possible mechanisms by which the combination of CR and IR might be working in concert to induce tumor regression, cDNA arrays were performed. This finding is consistent with the finding that the upregulation of the miR-17 ~ 92 oncomir cluster, including miR-17, miR-18a, miR-20a, and miR-92a, plays an important role in breast tumorigenesis and cell invasion [ Interestingly, in contrast to our findings about other miR members of this cluster, our dataset did not reveal a significant change in abundance of miR-19 with our treatments of CR or IR. After exposing 4T1 cells to media with decreasing concentrations of glucose or transfection with anti-sense-miR-17/20a or NC oligomers, scratch wound tests were performed ( Microarray analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs in TNBC in vivo model with different treatments The ANOVA analysis was used to compare 4 groups; AL, AL+IR, CR, and CR+IR Gene MAP pathway profile analyzed by GO-Elite The Z score compares related Ontology terms based on their relative over representation Z score, which is an indicator of degree of over representation Fold change calculated by pairwise comparisons of the average of mean array value between AL and CR + IR", "Insulin resistance plays a major pathophysiological role in the development of type 2 diabetes (DM)[ IR can be quantified using detailed physiological protocols, such as the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique[ We used data from the longitudinal Anqing Twin Cohort Study, which has been previously described [ Height was measured without shoes to the nearest 0.1 cm on a portable stadiometer. We used the gender-specific Z-score of each IR index to calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AROC) curve for the models. The demographic and clinical characteristics of subjects in this study are summarized in We found that the dynamic indices, ISI AROC analysis results are presented in The magnitude of association for each insulin resistance index at baseline with the risk of PDM/DM at follow-up ( To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the comparative ability of IR indices to predict PDM/DM stratified by diagnostic criteria. Third, some studies support that impaired \u00df cell function is also involved in the pathogenesis of PDM/DM[ In summary, we discovered substantial disparity among static and dynamic IR indices in predicting future PDM/DM.", "We aimed to investigate the effects of Sp on intestinal IR injury. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into: (1) a sham control group; (2) an IR control group, subjected to 30 min ischemia and 3 h reperfusion; (3) a group treated with Sp (20 mg/kg) for 3 d before the IR; and (4) a sham-operated control group treated with Sp (20 mg/kg). MDA content, myeloperoxidase activity, and plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 were all elevated in IR, indicating the oxidative stress and local and systemic inflammatory response. The results implicate that Sp may have a strong protective effect against the intestinal IR injury. Therefore, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism might be of potential therapeutic benefit in cases of intestinal IR damage.", "Here, we investigated the protective effect of PTX against cardiac ischemia and dysfunction following experimental angina in IR. IR, along with its accompanying cardiac dysfunction, was induced in rats by a high-fructose (10% in drinking water) high-fat diet for 12 weeks. Animals were housed in constant light/dark cycles with access to a standard rodent diet Six-week-old male Wistar rats (King Abdulaziz University) were randomly divided into 4 experimental groups (8 animals each): control, IR, PTX-treated IR, and PTX-treated control. IR was induced by adding fructose (10%) to the drinking water and feeding rats a high-fat high-salt diet containing 16% crude protein, 28.2% crude fat, 2.8% crude fiber, 4.8% ash, and 3.4% salt for 12 weeks. The high-fructose high-fat diet for 12 weeks produced IR as indicated by the significant elevation in blood glucose (p<0.001), fructosamine (p<0.01), and insulin (p<0.01) levels compared with control animals. Animals with IR were less resistant to an anginal attack and characterized by more severe cardiac ischemia as indicated by the significantly larger depression in ST height (p<0.01) compared with control. PTX administration significantly alleviated the ischemia in the hearts of IR animals as indicated by the significant decrease in ST height depression compared with the untreated IR group (all at p<0.05). Animals with IR were characterized by greater attenuation of the left ventricular pressure development as indicated by the significant decrease in average dP/dt (p<0.001) compared with control animals. PTX administration completely blocked the excessive decrease in average dP/dt (p<0.01) compared with untreated IR animals. PTX inhibited the development of cardiac ischemia and dysfunction in high-fructose high-fat diet-induced IR in rats. The following findings can explain the ability of PTX to counteract cardiac ischemia and dysfunction accompanying IR: (1) PTX alleviated the exaggerated cardiac ischemia following experimental angina in IR, (2) the attenuated left ventricular pressure development in IR was alleviated by PTX, and (3) PTX alleviated the low-grade inflammation associated with IR. These findings provide convincing evidence that PTX offsets the cardiac ischemia and dysfunction following experimental angina accompanying IR through inhibition of the low-grade inflammation. Our results show that animals with IR were less resistant to anginal attack and characterized by more severe cardiac ischemia as indicated by the significantly larger depression in ST height compared with controls. It has been widely agreed that in diabetes and IR, the heart is less resistant to ischemia during anginal attacks. In addition, the metabolic syndrome is associated with a high incidence of coronary atheroma and an increased risk of a fatal coronary event Ischemia is always followed by myocardial contractile dysfunction The IR animals in our study showed greater cardiac systolic and diastolic dysfunction following induction of angina by isoproterenol compared with controls. The left ventricular diastolic dysfunction has been shown in the present study and indicated in previous work Because PTX did not have a significant effect on the IR parameters but did significantly alleviate the cardiac ischemia and dysfunction with IR, the protective effect of PTX against cardiac ischemia and dysfunction in animals with IR seems to be a direct cardiovascular protective effect rather than a direct effect on the IR itself. The mechanisms by which PTX protects against cardiac ischemia and dysfunction in animals with IR could be mediated by reduction of the associated low-grade inflammation. Increasing evidence indicates that a cytokine-induced low-grade inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications The possibility that alterations in the circulating lipid profile contributed to the IR-PTX cardiac dysfunction interaction was also investigated. The IR model used in this study did not show significant changes in, and PTX administration did not affect, the serum lipid parameters in normal or IR animals. These observations exclude the role of serum lipids in the IR-PTX cardiac dysfunction interaction. PTX alleviates cardiac diastolic ischemia and dysfunction associated with IR directly through mechanisms involving inhibition of the low-grade inflammation associated with IR.", "However, the precise mechanism of EGCs under IR stimulation remains unclear. Here, we report that EGCs are closely involved in the modulation of IEB functions in response to IR challenge. The intestinal IR treatment led to the significant upregulation of the EGC activation marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein, accompanied by the increasing abundance of glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and inducible nitric oxidase (iNOS) proteins, which was also confirmed in in vitro hypoxia reoxygenation (HR) tests. These results suggest that GDNF plays an important role in the barrier-protective mechanism of activated EGCs under IR stimulation, whereas EGCs (via iNOS release) are also involved in intestinal inflammation response, which may contribute to IEB damage induced by IR injury.", "Herein, we challenged the hypothesis that ghrelin, a pleiotropic modulator, is potentially involved in IR-induced germ cell injury. Lower body exposure to 2 Gy of IR induced a notable increase of ghrelin expression in the nuclear of differentiating spermatogonia at defined stages, with an impairment in the Leydig cells (LCs)-expressing ghrelin. Initial quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses demonstrated a clear-cut elevation in Subsequent analyses were directed toward the characterization of the role of endogenous ghrelin signaling in IR-induced GC injury. Testicular IR induced oxidative stress, which was characterized by the elevated generation of malondialdehyde (MDA) ( P53-dependent apoptosis accounted for the bulk of the loss of the differentiating spermatogonia after IR. In the present study, a single IR induced a dramatic increase in the ghrelin expression level at both time-points studied. However, upregulation of ghrelin expression was only positively correlated to the elevated apoptosis at post-IR 16 h ( One distinguishing feature in our study is a dramatic decrease of ghrelin expression in LCs took place immediately after IR ( IR efficiently induces death of GCs, with the actively dividing spermatogonia being the most susceptible; doses as low as 0.1 Gy are known to cause damage to these cells. Further evidence for a functional role of elevated ghrelin expression is provided by its ability to elicit protective effect on differentiating spermatogonia in the presence of testicular IR. Inhibition of the interaction between ghrelin and its receptor using D-GHRP efficiently suppressed the nuclear translocation of ghrelin from post-irradiation 16 h onwards ( Testicular expression of ghrelin in response to IR appeared to be exquisitely regulated. So, how did IR-elicited ghrelin translocate from the cytoplasm to the nuclear? One possibility is that ghrelin travels with the assistance of other trafficking regulators in the presence of IR stress. In summary, we propose a model in which IR induces DNA damage within the differentiating spermatogonia, and in which p53, an intracellularly activated apoptotic protein, is stabilized by oxidative stress within GCs in response to the injury. On the other hand, the impairment of intratesticular environment by IR injury results in the downregulation of ghrelin expression in LCs and the subsequent increase in androgen production during the later phase, which may enhance the recovery of remaining GCs after testicular IR injury. Overall, the delicate regulation of local-produced ghrelin appears to be a fine-tune mechanism modulating the balance between testicular homeostasis and testicular IR injury ( Wild-type C57BL/6 male mice were obtained from the Animal Research Center of Fourth Military Medical University and maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark in a 20\u201325 \u00b0C environment, with free access to standard pellet mouse chow and tap water. All animal work was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Fourth Military Medical University and the protocols were strictly conformed to the In The involvement of endogenous ghrelin in response to testicular IR stress was evaluated in The ability of IR-induced oxidative stress to regulate testicular expression of ghrelin was monitored in In IR experiments were carried out as described previously. Testicular tissues were collected at the end of 16 h after IR treatment. IR treatment at a dose of 2 Gy evoked a significant increase in the expression of testicular ghrelin. ( The transient anti-apoptotic effect of endogenous ghrelin on differentiating spermatogonia is required for their early recovery from testicular IR stress (2 Gy).

( Summary diagram of the possible mechanisms related to testicular ghrelin function contributing to maintenance of the apoptotic balance during the early recovery after IR stress.", "Similarly, chronic exposure to low-dose IR caused the downregulation of genes involved in cytoskeleton remodeling, as well as in cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response pathways. Many of the genes or gene sets that were altered in the individual treatments (RPM or IR) were not altered in the combined treatment (RPM and IR), indicating a complex interaction between RPM and IR.", "At specific times following IR treatment, the number of dead cells was determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion test. Consequently, the cleavage of PARP may be considered as a useful marker for apoptosis and caspase activity induced by IR. Caspase-3 (CPP32, Yama, Apopain) is able to cleave PARP during the induction of apoptosis and there is evidence that IR-induced apoptosis involves activation of caspase-3 in human cells . It can be noticed that the AHH1 normal cells displayed a higher and more stable caspase-3 activity than the HSC-93 cells which showed a less pronounced and unstable caspase-3 activity at 48 h. So, the profile of PARP cleavage and caspase 3 activity for each normal cells corresponds to their respective sensitivity to IR. In sharp contrast, the proform band was not cleaved in the FA-C cells HSC-536, indicating that the caspase-3 was not activated after IR in these cells. In conclusion, this result, associated with the data showing the absence of PARP cleavage as well as the lack of in vitro caspase-3 activity in the FA-C extract, strongly demonstrates that the caspase-3 mechanism of activation stimulated by IR is not working properly in the absence of the wild-type FANCC protein. The present study was carried out to characterize the apoptotic process of cells in absence of wt FANCC after IR. Our results determined that: 1) apoptosis is not performed properly after IR independently of the mutations affecting the gene; and 2) that this alteration is due to an inability to activate caspase-3. Taking into account the fact that IR-induced apoptosis is reduced in FA cells compared to normal cells, it would be reasonable to suggest that a high proportion of irradiated cells in FA patients would die by a necrotic inflammatory pathway, in contrast to the normal individuals where the non-inflammatory apoptotic mechanism would account for elimination of damaged cells. This is particularly true for IR for which different investigations led to controversial conclusions about the relative involvement of the caspase-8 or caspase-9 pathways. A critical question that emerges from all these data is how IR-induced apoptosis can be reduced in cells that display an elevated spontaneous apoptosis, i.e., that have lost an anti-apoptotic activity.", "The authors investigated the effects of preadministration of isoflurane and sevoflurane on IR-induced lung injury in an isolated buffer-perfused rat lung model. Isolated rat lungs were designated into four groups: control group (n = 6): perfusion for 120 min without ischemia; IR group (n = 6): interruption of perfusion and ventilation for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 60 min; sevoflurane (SEVO)-IR (n = 6) and isoflurane (ISO)-IR (n = 6) groups: 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) isoflurane or sevoflurane was administered for 30 min, followed by 60 min ischemia, then 60 min reperfusion. IR caused significant increases in the coefficient of filtration (approximately sevenfold at 60 min of reperfusion compared with baseline; P < 0.01), the wet-to-dry lung weight ratio, the rate of increase of lactate dehydrogenase activity, and tumor necrosis factor a in the perfusate, and caused a significant decrease in nitric oxide metabolites in the perfusate. Administration of 1 MAC isoflurane or sevoflurane before ischemia significantly attenuated IR-induced increases in the coefficient of filtration and the wet-to-dry lung weight ratio, inhibited increases in the rate of increase of lactate dehydrogenase activity and tumor necrosis factor alpha in the perfusate, and abrogated the decrease in nitric oxide metabolites in the perfusate. No difference was found between the SEVO-IR and ISO-IR groups. Isoflurane and sevoflurane administered before ischemia can attenuate IR-induced injury in isolated rat lungs.", "We investigated whether a nitric oxide donor, nitroglycerin (NTG), could suppress the oxidative stress of IR injury and improve pulmonary function after reperfusion in an ex vivo rat lung perfusion model. Therefore, administration of NTG attenuates the oxidative stress of IR injury, and may improve pulmonary function after reperfusion.", "DNA-repair induction and other responses to IR are mediated by signalling pathways that are defective in A-T cells. Because ATM plays a role in the response of mammalian cells to rapamycin, the effect of rapamycin on IR enhancement of dsb repair was investigated. These findings demonstrate that rapamycin does not affect IR enhancement of dsb-repair fidelity in normal cells but restores this phenomenon in A-T lymphoblasts, and suggests the involvement of a rapamycin-sensitive pathway in radiation-enhanced dsb repair.", "The data obtained from IR/IGF-1R chimaeras of both full length receptor and ectodomain established the importance of the Cys-rich region in controlling IGF-1 binding specificity, but not insulin binding. Module 6 has a mobile loop (residues 255\u2013265) which extends into the central cavity of the L1/Cys-rich/L2 fragment and is the most divergent Cys-rich module in terms of sequence identity compared to IR, with 25 of the 31 residues being different. The corresponding region in IR is larger, containing four additional residues and a disulphide bond not present in IGF-1R and has a markedly different net charge with five basic residues and one acidic residue compared to six acidic residues and one basic residue in module 6 of hIGF-1R . Thus the larger size and positive charge of the loop in hIR may serve to perturb binding of IGF-1, so reducing the affinity of the receptor for this ligand, while maintaining tight binding of the smaller insulin molecule. To test this hypothesis, a mutant hIR was constructed in which residues 260\u2013277 of hIR were replaced by residues 253\u2013266 of IGF-1R () and the effects on ligand binding to this chimaeric receptor, termed hIR-Cys loop exchange (CLX), were examined. In addition, the epitope for Mab 83-7 which is known to be located within residues 191\u2013297 of the Cys-rich region of IR , has been further mapped using this chimaera. Four of the seven sequence differences between the mouse and human IR sequences within the region 191\u2013297 are located within the variable loop of module 6 that has been exchanged in this hIR-CLX chimaera, making it a useful construct to further define the 83-7 epitope. The DNA used in these studies was derived from a full-length hIR cDNA from plasmid peT . A 1.0 kb RI fragment of hIR cDNA from plasmid peT, encoding the N-terminal sequence to amino acid residue 296 , was introduced into M13mp18 for mutagenesis. Oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis using the USB-T7 Gen\u2122 in vitro mutagenesis kit was employed to exchange nucleotide sequence encoding amino acid residues 260\u2013277 inclusive of hIR with the sequence encoding residues 253\u2013266 inclusive of IGF-1R (). A vehicle for mammalian cell expression of hIR cDNA with which the mutated fragment could be exchanged was prepared from expression vector pEE14 (Celltech, Slough, UK modified by deletion of the RI restriction site through fill-in and religation. The hIR cDNA for this construct was from plasmid peT, and was inserted into the polylinker of the modified pEE14 expression vector as a dIII\u2013I fragment. The mutagenised DNA cloned in M13mp18 was exchanged with the corresponding part of hIR cDNA of this expression vehicle by exchange of the 1.0 kb RI fragments. These procedures produced an expression vehicle encoding a mutant hIR designated hIR-CLX, in which a segment of the sequence which forms a loop within module 6 of the Cys-rich domain was replaced by the shorter loop of the IGF-1R sequence with four fewer residues and lacking the nested disulphide bond of the hIR sequence. Solubilised receptors were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with the conformation-dependent, anti-\u03b1 chain-specific hIR monoclonal antibodies 83-7 or 83-14 . Immunoblotting of membranes was performed in 3% skim milk in TBST (10 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) using the hIR \u03b2-chain-specific monoclonal antibody, CT-1 . The effects of replacing residues 260\u2013277 of human insulin receptor (hIR) with residues 253\u2013266 of hIGF-IR (see ) on proreceptor processing and assembly in 293T cells were analysed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation of wild-type hIR from transfected cell lysates with either Mab 83-14 or Mab 83-7, followed by immunoblotting with the \u03b2-chain Mab CT-1, showed only processed \u03b2-chain subunits (, lanes 2 and 5), although proreceptor is discernible upon longer exposure (data not shown). In contrast, the chimaeric proreceptor (hIR-CLX) is processed inefficiently, as indicated by the disproportionate amount of proreceptor relative to \u03b2-chain detected by Mab CT-1 in cell lysates of transfected cells (, lane 8), and following immunoprecipitation with Mab 83-14 (, lane 3). Mab 83-7 still binds hIR-CLX but exhibits a reduced affinity for the chimaeric receptor compared to the wild-type receptor, based on immunoprecipitation (, lane 5 vs 6) and fails to immunoprecipitate the hIR-CLX proreceptor, in contrast to 83-14 (, lane 3 vs 6). Competition binding assays, in which I-insulin is displaced by unlabelled insulin, showed that insulin binding by hIR-CLX and hIR did not differ significantly (). Analysis of the binding data produces similar dissociation constants for both receptors (hIR: =2.1\u00b10.9\u00d710, =7.2\u00b12.0 10 and hIR-CLX: =1.1\u00b10.1\u00d710, =1.6\u00b10.6 10). However, competitive binding assays using I-insulin and unlabelled IGF-1 as the competing ligand show a substantial (10 fold) difference between hIR and hIR-CLX (); IGF-1 displacing I-insulin bound to hIR-CLX more easily than I-insulin bound to hIR (hIR-CLX, IC=5.7\u00b12.0\u00d710 M; hIR, IC=5.7\u00b12.2\u00d710 M). Competitive binding studies were also carried out in triplicate on hIR and hIR_CLX expressed in COS cells. There was no difference in capacity of insulin to displace I-insulin from either construct (not shown) while the capacity of IGF-1 to displace I-insulin from hIR_CLX was 12 times greater than its ability to displace radiolabelled ligand from wild-type hIR (not shown). An analysis of 12 IR/IGF-1R chimaeras showed that the IGF-1 specificity determinants were located between IGF-1R residues 132\u2013315 . IR-based chimaeras, containing residues 1\u2013514, 1\u2013315 or 132\u2013315 from IGF-1R, bound IGF-1 with high affinity while chimaeras 132\u2013315 from IGF-1R did not . The binding specificity determinant could be further narrowed to residues 184\u2013279, based on the binding characteristics of a series of IR/IGF-1R ectodomain chimaeras: a chimaera containing residues 1\u2013284 from IGF-1R, bound IGF-1 with high affinity , another chimaera containing IGF-1R residues 1\u2013180 bound neither ligand , while a chimaera containing residues 184\u2013279 of IGF-1R bound both insulin and IGF-1 with high affinity . The differential binding specificities of IR-based chimaeric whole receptors containing residues 1\u2013217 of IGF-1R (which bound insulin preferentially) and 1\u2013274 of IGF-1R (which bound IGF-1 preferentially), mapped the location of the IGF-1 specificity determinants to residues 223\u2013274 of IGF-1R, since residues 218\u2013222 are conserved between IGF-1R and IR . The chimaeric receptor hIR-CLX was not significantly different from wild-type hIR in terms of insulin binding affinity, but was more amenable to displacement of I-insulin by IGF-1 than was hIR. High-resolution structural information is required to establish whether this loop makes direct contact with IGF-1 in the ligand/receptor complex or whether the poorer binding of IGF-1 by IR is due to steric constraints imposed by the loop. Studies on IGF-1 have shown that replacement of the C region by a four residue glycine linker reduced affinity for IGF-1R by 40\u2013100 fold with a 10 fold reduction or a small increase in binding to IR. The region of the receptor responsible for recognising Arg-36 and Arg-37 is the Cys-rich region 217\u2013284 which has eight acidic residues not found in the corresponding positions in IR. Six of these line the putative binding pocket, including the three in the loop region which when exchanged (hIR-CLX) dramatically affected the displacement of bound insulin by IGF-1. The hIR-CLX chimaera provided an opportunity to further map the residues involved in the epitope for Mab 83-7 . The epitope of mouse Mab 83-7 resides between residues 191 and 297 in the Cys-rich region of hIR which has seven residues different from mouse IR , four of which occur in the exchanged loop. The fact that hIR-CLX (in which all 14 amino acid residues encompassing the exchanged loop differ from those in the wild-type hIR), can still be recognised by Mab 83-7, indicates that the module 6 loop of hIR does not contribute substantially to the epitope. Of the remaining three sequence differences between mouse and human IR in the region 191\u2013297, residue 218 is adjacent to an N-linked glycosylation site at 215 and thus likely to be obscured by oligosaccharide. This leaves residues 210 in the third Cys-rich module and 236 in the fourth Cys-rich module, as the major contributors to the epitope on hIR for the mouse monoclonal antibody 83-7. In the three-dimensional structure of hIGF-1R, the residues equivalent to 210 and 236 of hIR are in close proximity at 12 \u00c5 , in a location that is consistent with the single molecule images of hIR/83-7 Fab complexes .", "Whilst most GF-RTKs regulate long-term events such as cell differentiation and mitogenesis, a major function of the IR is the acute regulation of glucose metabolism in muscle and fat cells. It has been proposed that IRS proteins have evolved to facilitate this unique aspect of insulin action. Numerous tyrosine phosphorylation sites on IRSs act as docking sites for Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing signalling molecules, indicating that IRSs represent the epicentre for the majority of IR downstream signalling events involved in insulin action . Overexpression of signalling molecules, including IRS proteins , in some cases causes constitutive activation and more potent phenotypes are often observed if soluble signalling molecules become permanently associated with membranes; in fact, Akt becomes transforming under these conditions . What role do IRS proteins play in this and other aspects of insulin signalling? Previous studies have suggested that IRS proteins may be localized to the cytoskeleton and that this localization is regulated. In this review we consider the evidence to support the cytoskeletal association of IRS and discuss the physiological consequence of this localization. A model is presented to suggest that this may prevent IRS from targeted degradation and thus play an important role in insulin sensitivity. To date, four IRS proteins have been identified (denoted IRS-1 to IRS-4), all having a conserved domain structure, including pleckstrin homology (PH) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains at the amino terminus that are required for efficient coupling to the IR. The PTB domain binds directly to the juxtamembrane region of the IR (at the NPXY motif) and this is thought to be enhanced by interactions of the PH domain with membrane phospholipids or intracellular proteins . While there is considerable evidence for a direct role of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in insulin\u2019s metabolic actions , the role of IRS-3 or IRS-4 is less clear, despite the fact that overexpression of these proteins in adipocytes mimic some of insulin\u2019s actions : IRS-4 is undetectable in muscle or adipocytes , and IRS-3, which undergoes insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in adipocytes, does not appear to bind significant levels of PI3K in response to insulin . In addition, IRS-3 mice exhibit normal glucose tolerance . Conversely, both IRS-1 and IRS-2 are major insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphoproteins in adipocytes and muscle cells and IRS-1 and IRS-2 mice both display insulin resistance . Whilst many of the downstream signalling molecules are conserved, such as PI3K and Akt, it is noteworthy that both the and IR homologues contain a carboxy-terminal extension reminiscent of IRS-1, which contains putative docking sites for PI3K and SHP2 . However, only a single homologue of IRS, termed CHICO, has been identified in and no IRS homologues have currently been identified in . Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the IRS proteins have evolved as a family of molecules distinct from the IR family to afford higher organisms greater flexibility to coordinate multiple events. To enable the acute regulation of the insulin signalling network, phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 by the IR must occur rapidly. Because IRS proteins are soluble molecules, however, it is unclear how and where they intersect with the membrane-associated IR. The requirement for IR internalisation in promoting IRS tyrosine phosphorylation has been the subject of several studies. However, IR internalisation was not completely inhibited in these studies and, given the catalytic nature of the signal generated, it is conceivable that only a small amount of internalised IR is necessary to stimulate IRS tyrosine phosphorylation. In determining the site of coupling between IRS and the IR, the intracellular location of IRS-1/2 is of considerable interest. Kelly and Ruderman first showed, by crude fractionation, that IRS-1 is highly enriched in an intracellular fraction referred to as either the low-density microsomes or high-speed pellet (HSP). Notably, the IR is not enriched in this fraction . More recently, IRS-2 has been shown to be enriched in this fraction . This appears to represent the active component of IRS-1/2 because HSP-associated IRS-1/2 is rapidly and highly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to insulin treatment of cells, leading to a specific increase in PI3K in this fraction. Conversely, there is little or no recruitment of PI3K to fractions containing the tyrosine phosphorylated IR . Biochemical studies have since indicated that IRS-1/2 co-sediment with the HSP fraction not because of their association with membranes but rather because of their association with large polypeptide complexes \u2014 possibly the cytoskeleton . Thus, IRS-1/2 may slide along the filaments that make up this array and transiently interact with the membrane, possibly via PH domain interactions, so increasing the efficiency of coupling with the IR (see ). A completely different model, which also cannot be ruled out at the present time, is that IRS-1/2 binds to a large polypeptide complex distinct from the cytoskeleton that sediments with the HSP and this complex may associate with the IR in a regulated manner. They have suggested that IRS-1/2 may associate with the IR in clathrin-coated pits at the cell surface . However, there is no evidence that AP3 adaptors regulate the formation of clathrin-coated pits at the cell surface, thus further emphasising the need to re-investigate the need for IR internalisation in IRS phosphorylation. An additional advantage of anchoring IRS-1/2 proteins to the cytoskeleton is that this may create a scaffold for attracting other downstream molecules, such as PI3K/Akt, and then provide a very controlled way of delivering these molecules to their appropriate site of action. First, fractionation studies indicate that the majority of insulin-stimulated IRS-associated PI3K activity resides in the HSP, whereas PDGF activates PI3K in the plasma membrane. Collectively, these findings indicate that IRS-1/2-mediated activation of PI3K is qualitatively different to that mediated by direct association with the PDGF receptor. One model that may account for these differences is that the PDGF receptor and IRS-1/2 recruit PI3K to distinct plasma membrane microdomains with unique lipid compositions including PIP3. Alternatively, IRS-1/2 may also regulate PI3K/Akt at more remote locations in the cell that are inaccessible to the PDGF receptor. In addition to stimulating IRS tyrosine phosphory- lation, insulin also causes increased serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which is thought to cause conformational changes, making it a poor substrate for the IR . Serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRSs also appears concomitant with IRS dissociation from the HSP, leading to the suggestion that these events may be linked . However, it has since been found that IRS dissociation from the HSP may be uncoupled from IRS serine/threonine phosphorylation and that serine/threonine phosphorylation of components other than IRSs are accountable for this effect . In keeping with the model that a HSP cytoskeletal matrix interacts with IRS-1/2, the serine kinase ROK\u03b1 constitutes a suitable candidate for regulating this effect. ROK\u03b1 binds to IRS-1 and has been further implicated in the disassembly of the cytoskeleton . Disassembly of the cytoskeleton provides a second potential mechanism for signal termination by disengaging IRS from its access to IR. Whilst integration may occur at many levels, the IRS proteins are ideally positioned to combine signals from multiple receptors. In many cases, they appear to do so at an early signalling step between insulin binding and PI3K activity, namely at the level of the IRS . There is also substantial evidence to suggest that at least some forms of insulin resistance may operate at the level of the IRS. TNF\u03b1 , okadaic acid or chronic insulin treatment all increase serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRSs and induce insulin-resistant states. Indeed, increased IRS serine kinase activity has recently been detected in diabetic states . Consistent with the above mechanisms for signal termination described above, we have found that chronic insulin or okadaic acid treatments result in quantitative dissociation of the IRS from the HSP . Moreover, oxidative stress has been reported to promote insulin resistance by disruption of the intracellular distribution of IRS-1 . Dissociation of IRS from the HSP may also provide a rational basis for the observed decrease in total intracellular IRS upon chronic insulin treatment. Release of IRS into the cytosol coincides with this decrease in IRS , and may thereby facilitate greater IRS accessibility to proteases such as the proteasome . As such, reduced IRS protein levels have been reported in many states of insulin resistance. The involvement of IRS-1/2 appears to be central to the unique ability of the IR to regulate events such as glucose metabolism. Approaches such as immunoelectron microscopy should provide further insight into the location of IRS-1/2 and the cytoskeleton in adipocytes. Furthermore, identification of the proteins in the HSP that interact with IRS-1/2, and subsequent characterisation of the domains responsible for this interaction, will increase our understanding of how these processes are regulated. Fantin have confirmed that IRS-4 does not play a major role in the overall response to insulin. However, the authors speculate that the differences between IRS-4 and wild-type mice may be due to alterations in hypothalamic function.", "However, it has not conclusively been shown whether the association between hyperuricemia and increased death rate is secondary to the association between IR and death or hyperuricemia itself is an independent risk of death. It is of interest to examine the effects of insulin sensitizer which was developed recently on serum urate concentration because it may provide a new idea as to the mechanism of the association between IR, hyperuricemia and vascular disorders. In the present paper, we discuss the relevance of IR to hyperuricemia and gout, and show the data of urate and glucose metabolism obtained from control subjects or the patients with hyperuricemia, gout or type 2 diabetes.", "Though downstream targets of the ATM kinase are still being elucidated, it has been demonstrated that ATM acts upstream of p53 in a signal transduction pathway initiated by IR and can phosphorylate p53 at serine 15. This enhanced activity was apparent immediately after treatment of cells with IR, but was not accompanied by a change in the abundance of the ATM protein. Since IR activates the ATM kinase in all phases of the cell cycle, DNA replication-dependent strand breaks are not required for this activation. Further, since p53 protein is not directly required for IR-induced S and G2-phase checkpoints, the ATM kinase likely has different functional targets in different phases of the cell cycle.", "Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IR due to tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 18.34+/-0.29 microM and unchanged Glut4 mRNA levels was observed following chrysophanol-8-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside treatment. Chrysophanol up to 100 microM exerted mild glucose transport activity and elevated the tyrosine phosphorylation of IR via tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibition (IC50=79.86+/-0.12 microM); Glut4 mRNA expression was also significantly increased by 100 microM.", "Therefore, the role of endothelin receptor antagonism in IR-induced-tissue injury carries great interest. Here, we examined the effect of tezosentan, a nonselective antagonist for endothelin receptors, on myocardial injury induced by abdominal aortic IR, which represents a model of the IR injury in distant organs frequently occurred after vascular surgery. Thirty-two Wistar rats were randomized into four groups (n = 8) as follows: control (sham laparotomy), aortic IR (120 min ischemia and 120 min reperfusion), aortic IR + tezosentan (10 mg/kg intravenous injection before ischemia plus continuous intravenous infusion of 1 mg/kg/hr during the IR injury), and control + tezosentan. Biochemical analysis showed that aortic IR significantly increased (p < 0.05 vs control) the plasma levels of troponin-I, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and the myocardial tissue levels of malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and catalase, whereas tezosentan significantly decreased these same factors (p < 0.05 vs aortic IR). Histological evaluation also showed that aortic IR significantly increased (p < 0.05 vs control) myocardial disorganization, myofiber swelling and myofiber eosinophilia in myocardial tissue samples, whereas tezosentan significantly decreased these factors (p < 0.05 vs aortic IR). These results indicate that tezosentan has protective effects against myocardial injury induced by abdominal aortic IR in rats. We propose that the mechanisms underlying this protective effect of tezosentan involves the reduction of oxidative stress and subsequent lipid peroxidation, the inhibition of systemic inflammatory response, and acting cytoprotective on myocytes after aortic IR.", "In this study, we investigated the effect of edaravone on preventing IR injury of the lung in a canine lung transplantation model. Another six dogs were obtained as normal control group in which left lungs were dissected after thoracotomy without an IR injury. Edaravone attenuates IR-induced lung injury and preserves lung function by inhibiting oxidative stress and decreasing leukocyte extravasation in a canine lung transplantation model.", "Specifically, initial DNA end synapsis occurs prior to (and in fact it activates) DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation and kinase activation ( To assess the perturbation in DNA-PK function and evaluate potential quantitative failure in the repair response, we used the IR-induced H2AX foci model. The spatial organization of the cellular DNA damage repair response is reflected in the formation and resolution of these IRIF ( In addition to the direct effects upon DNA damage recognition and repair, DNA-PK is an early mediator of cell cycle arrest via activation of Chk2 ( Another target of DNA-PK is the tumor suppressor p53, which has been shown to be phosphorylated by DNA-PK on serine residues 15 and 37 ( DNA-PK is also critical for telomere capping, and DNA-PK-deficiency promotes increased chromosomal instability with telomeric fusions ( An immediate question to address is why a retrovirus would target the NHEJ DNA repair pathway.

For rats in each animal model and normal control rats, IR was detected by euglycemic insulin clamp technique (EICT) and glucose infusion rate (GIR, an index of IR) was calculated. In IR rats, 1,25(OH)(2)D level, 1,25-25-R, and BMD level were significantly higher than those in T2DM rats and were lower than those in normal control rats. In the aged rats with T2DM or IR, administration of VD had no effect on 25(OH)D level, 1,25(OH)(2)D level, 1,25-25-R, and BMD level. For the aged rats with T2DM or IR, GIR positively correlated with both levels of 1,25(OH)(2)D and BMD, and 1,25-25-R positively and significantly correlated with levels of BMD. In T2DM or IR, IRH is a precipitating factor for bone loss. IR seems to play a major role in the pathogenesis of both IRH and bone loss in T2DM.", "However, IR in the geriatric population is influenced multifactorially and the exact age-associated mechanism is unclear. A field of research that is adding to the current understanding of biochemical aspects of IR is the study of \u201cadipokines\u201d that have been produced from adipocytes and found to have local and systemic effects important to glucose and lipid metabolism . Retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), initially thought to be a retinol transporter , has recently attracted considerable attention as an adipokine that provides a possible link between expression of adipose-glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in adipocytes and IR . Therefore, more studies with varied populations are needed to clarify the relationship between circulating RBP4 levels and IR, and because of this, we investigated the relationship between serum RBP4 levels and IR in obese and nonobese elderly subjects. IR was estimated using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, which is calculated as follows: fasting insulin (U/ml)\u00d7fasting glucose (\u03bcmol/l)/22.5. After TG, HOMA-IR were log-transformed to improve the skewness of the distribution, Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate the relationship between serum RBP4 levels and metabolic variables. In contrast, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in blood pressure, fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol levels. RBP4 levels were positively correlated with fasting insulin (=0.28, <.01), HOMA-IR (=0.31, <.01), and triglycerides (=0.26, <.01). However, after subgroup analysis, RBP4 levels were positively correlated with fasting glucose (=0.34, =0.01), fasting insulin (=0.45, <0.01), and HOMA-IR (=0.47, <0.01) in the obese group only. In the nonobese group, RBP4 levels were positively correlated with triglyceride levels (=0.25, =0.04), but nonsignificantly correlated with HOMA-IR (=0.16, =0.40) (). In step-wise multiple linear regression analysis, RBP4 was found to be independently associated with triglyceride levels in the nonobese group and independently associated with HOMA-IR in the obese group, as shown in . Aging is associated with an increase in IR, yet the underlying mechanism is not well established . A better understanding of the mechanisms age-related IR may help to elucidate the complex relationship between cardiometabolic disease and mortality/morbidity in older adults . Although the role of RBP4 as a mediator of IR in human is not yet clarified, this protein appears to be an important adipokine implicated in the interplay between obesity and IR . In the present study, we showed that RBP4 levels were significantly correlated with IR measured as HOMA-IR in obese elderly subjects, even after adjusting for potential covariates that are known to be linked to IR. This is the first study to assess the association between RBP4 and IR in the elderly subjects to evaluate the difference of BMI on this association. In addition, a lack of association between RBP4 and fasting insulin and HOMA-IR in nonobese elderly subjects in our study is consistent with a recently published study . These approaches might allow a more definitive assessment of the association of RBP4 with IR. In conclusion, among obese elderly subjects, RBP4 is associated with IR, but this association was not consistent among the nonobese elderly subjects. Irrespective of the question of whether associations reflect causal effects, our findings collectively suggest that RBP4 may be linked to IR and lipid metabolism at least in the elderly subjects.", "1,2-Bis ( Mouse MIN6, \u03b2IRKO, and control \u03b2WT cells ( Islets were isolated from Balb/c mice by pancreatic duct injection of collagenase solution followed by digestion ( Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The synthesized cDNA was added to the PCR mixture containing platinum pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in the presence of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 gene-specific primers ( The hTRPV2-flag-EGFP, hTRPV2-flag-RFP, and hTRPV2-flag-EGFP-c-myc were prepared as described previously ( Three short-hairpin oligonucleotides and complementary strands were designed to specifically target mouse IR, and six oligonucleotides were designed to specially target mouse TRPV2. To generate the recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing shRNAs for mouse IR (Ad-shIR) and mouse TRPV2 (Ad-shTRPV2), selected pENTER/U6-shRNA plasmids were recombined into the Gateway-based pAd-BLOCK-iT DEST vector (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of effective IR-shRNA and TRPV2-shRNA are shown below.

Even in the absence of insulin, TRPV2 inserted into the plasma membrane was observed to some extent ( We next addressed whether or not the effect of insulin was mediated by IR. We decreased the expression of IR by introducing shRNA. In cells infected with Ad-shIR, the expression of IR was markedly reduced ( To examine the effect of insulin on calcium entry, we monitored changes in [Ca We then examined the role of TRPV2 in regulation of insulin secretion and cell growth of MIN6 cells.", "Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) is protease recently proposed as a novel adipokine linked to IR. We aimed to assess the relationship between fasting serum DPP4 activityand IR in type 1 diabetic (T1DM) patients. IR was esimated using the equation for insulin sensitivity derived from euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp studies-estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR). Serum DPP4 activity is associated with IR in T1DM patients and it might play an important role in its pathophysiology.", "We conducted a path analysis to estimate the simultaneous effects of maternal IR and maternal fuels (fasting glucose, triacylglycerol [TG] and NEFA levels) in late pregnancy in mediating the relationship between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and neonatal adiposity (per cent fat mass [%FM]). The total effect of maternal BMI on neonatal %FM was significant (total effect 0.16, 95% CI 0.08, 0.22, Using a novel application of path analysis our data implicate maternal IR and glucose levels as important mediators of the association between maternal and infant adiposity. To estimate IR in pregnancy, the HOMA-IR equation was used. Hypothesised mediators included IR, maternal fasting glucose, TG and total NEFA levels. The pathway leading from pre-pregnancy BMI to neonatal %FM through increased maternal IR and increased glucose levels was significant (indirect effect = 0.03, 95% CI 0.01, 0.05, Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was associated with increased neonatal adiposity across the entire range of BMI levels. Importantly and novel, our data suggest that increasing maternal IR and glucose levels, even within normal range, are responsible for 21% of the association between pre-pregnancy BMI and neonatal adiposity, with no significant contribution from other fuels. Another study in Colorado, conducted under controlled dietary conditions, found that maternal TG levels measured early in pregnancy correlated strongly with neonatal FM at birth [ We found that maternal IR was negatively associated with late-pregnancy NEFA levels. With increasing IR, fasting-induced lipolysis of stored TG increases NEFA release. In conclusion, our study suggests that part of the association between maternal and offspring adiposity is due to specific intrauterine effects\u2014increased maternal IR and fasting glucose levels, leading to neonatal FM accretion. These effects are seen over the entire range of maternal BMI, IR and blood glucose levels in pregnancy. Fat mass Fat-free mass Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Insulin resistance Triacylglycerol Per cent fat mass Revised path model depicting tested mediated pathways between pre-pregnancy BMI, HOMA-IR, maternal TG, glucose and NEFA, and neonatal %FM at birth (solid arrows).", "Here, we evaluated whether adipose tissue (AT) IR and related metabolic alterations resulted in CNS changes by studying synapse lipid composition and function in the adipocyte-specific ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphate phosphodiesterase overexpressing transgenic (At A growing body of evidence indicates that cognitive impairment is associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) ( Altered production of adipokines and lipid metabolism regulation in adipose tissue (AT) ( We have developed an adipocyte-specific ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphate phosphodiesterase overexpressing transgenic (At Eighty-one adult male AtENPP1-Tg (transgenic, Tg) and C57Bl/6J (wild type, WT) mice were randomized to receive dietary intervention. Only in the HFD-fed At To gain initial knowledge on post-receptor insulin signaling activation of At Our results provide new evidence for AT IR-induced biochemical and functional changes in hippocampal synapses. This change was most pronounced in HFD-fed At- Because of the association between IR and cognitive impairment, next we studied whether that peripherally-induced IR could have a negative impact on synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. While previous animal studies have reported HFD-induced memory deficits ( Next, we evaluated hippocampal expression of both \u03b1- and \u03b2- subunits of the insulin receptor and found that they were down-regulated in the HFD-fed At The synapse between Schaffer collaterals and CA1 pyramidal neurons is under the control of NMDA-dependent plasticity ( Our results suggest that peripheral lipids and IR alter hippocampal molecular and functional integrity, which could be a pivotal mechanism responsible for the reported cognitive deficits associated with metabolic syndrome and T2D.", "In addition, we produced a new monoclonal antibody against EphA5 that sensitizes lung cancer cells to IR NU/NU nude mice and Balb/c mice (Harlan Laboratories) were housed in the animal facility of the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX). Extraction of total protein was performed with Nonidet P-40 extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors (50 m Fractionation of DNA-associated proteins was performed as follows: nonirradiated control cells or cells treated with IR were washed once with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in extraction buffer (10 m Two sets of total RNA were independently isolated from cells with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Immunocapture of ATM and pATM was performed with Reacti-bind protein A plates (Pierce) coated with anti-pATM, anti-ATM, or IgG control antibodies, as described ( Cells were removed and plated sparsely on 6-well plates (Falcon) (250 or 500 cells/well) or 100 \u00d7 15mm Petri dishes (BD Falcon) (5,000 cells/dish) and were exposed to the specified doses of IR. Clonogenic survival was calculated for each IR dose after normalizing for plating efficiency. After overnight incubation, cells were treated with 3 Gy of IR and fixed in methanol at different time points after irradiation. Cells were partially synchronized in 0.2% BSA in DMEM and were stimulated with 10% FBS 24 h prior to IR treatment. Approximately 30 min before analysis, cells were incubated in a solution of PBS containing 1% BSA and 50 \u03bc Staining of subconfluent cultured cells with a \u03b2-gal staining kit (Cell Signaling) was performed 7 days after treatment with IR (5 Gy). Immunoblotting confirmed comparable reduction of EphA5 protein levels relative to the nontargeted control NT-shRNA and H460 wild-type cells ( These observations were followed by a functional evaluation of cell cycle checkpoint activity after IR-induced DNA damage in G In comparison to nonirradiated cells, IR elicited cell cycle effects that were dependent on EphA5 expression. Control H460 cells were arrested in G To investigate further a potential role for EphA5 in the cellular response to DNA damage, we used a clonogenic (colony formation) assay to test the survival of cells expressing different levels of EphA5 upon IR treatment. Cells expressing low levels (A549) or lacking EphA5 expression (H226) were more sensitive to IR in comparison to H460 cells ( These findings were also validated by immunofluorescence to measure the formation of active DNA damage repair foci with an antibody against phosphorylated ATM (pATM). Quantification of active pATM foci 10 min after cell treatment showed a marked reduction in the number of nuclear foci in H460 EphA5-shRNA cells in comparison to control and EphA5-rescued cells ( Given the importance of EphA5 in resistance to IR treatment, we set out to validate these findings by examining the levels of EphA5 and its effect on response to radiation therapy in an independent cohort of surgically resected tumors from lung cancer patients ( Because our data implicated EphA5 in cell cycle control following IR and in intrinsic cellular radiosensitivity, we asked whether EphA5 and ATM would be molecular partners. A clear interaction between pATM and the cytoplasmic domain of EphA5 was observed under these experimental conditions ( Together, these results show a previously unrecognized interaction between EphA5 and phosphorylated ATM and also suggest the translocation of EphA5 to the nucleus upon IR. Indeed, cell fractionation studies confirmed the transport of EphA5 to the nucleus of irradiated cells and its association with chromatin ( Our findings thus far suggest that IR induces EphA5 nuclear localization, where it interacts with active ATM. H1299 EphA5-shRNA p53-null cells and control cells were treated with IR, and cellular senescence was assessed by SA-\u03b2-gal activity. Based on our studies, the presence or absence of EphA5 dictates the terminal fate of IR-exposed lung cancer cells: in the absence of EphA5, p53-proficient cells become senescent, and in the absence of both EphA5 and p53, lung cancer cells die. This antibody recognizes both human and rat, but not mouse EphA5 ( We produced overlapping peptides covering residues 304\u2013467 of the extracellular portion of human EphA5 (not present in mouse EphA5) and used ELISA to define the nature of the epitope bound by 11C12 ( To initiate the functional characterization of 11C12, we exposed human lung cancer cells (H460, H522, and A549) to increasing doses of IR in the presence or absence of 11C12 or a control isotype IgG and assayed for clonogenicity 10 days after irradiation ( Encouraged by these data, we used molecular imaging to study the accessibility of EphA5 Tumor targeting is clearly observed in animals receiving 11C12 ( Next, we tested To evaluate the mechanism of action of 11C12 In conclusion, these experiments show that 11C12 increases the sensitivity of human lung cancer cells to radiation therapy and indicate that a combination of anti-proliferative and pro-senescence activities contributes to its therapeutic effects. Indeed, we showed that newly identified molecular cross-talk between EphA5-mediated pathways and p53 controls the terminal fate of cells exposed to IR: in the absence of EphA5, p53-proficient lung cancer cells become senescent, and in the absence of both EphA5 and p53, lung cancer cells die.", "The present study investigates the role of vitamin E on the liver damage after renal IR. First, male mice were subjected to three groups (n = 9): 1) sham-operated, (2) renal IR (45 min ischemia), (3) renal IR + Vitamin E (150 mg/kg trough feeding tube for 28 d). Liver tissues malondialdehyde (MDA) increased and total glutathione (GSH) concentration decreased in the IR group compared to the sham group. Vitamin E consumption diminished the IR-induced increase in plasma AST and ALT. In addition, Vitamin E inhibited the IR-induced decrease in GSH activity and diminished IR-induced increase in MDA concentration. These findings showed that vitamin E consumption partly inhibited the IR-induced liver damage.", "The present study was designed to further investigate the protective effects of ATX on oxidative stress induced toxicity in tubular epithelial cells and on IR induced renal injury in mice. Given the storage of organs from decreased donors available for transplantation, transplants using so-called \u201cmarginal\u201d organs have increased despite their reduced viability and increased immunogenicity compared with living donor renal allografts [ Although the mechanisms by which organ damage occurs in IR-induced renal injury are incompletely understood, it has been suggested that oxidative injury following IR most likely contributed to the pathogenesis of IR [ Astaxanthin (ATX) is a carotenoid pigment naturally existing in seafood, such as salmon, shells of crabs and shrimps, as well as a wide variety of plants and algae [ The present study was therefore designed to examine the therapeutic effect of ATX in IR-induced renal injury using an IR model in mice. We hypothesize that pretreatment of ATX could offer protective effects against IR-induced renal injury by reducing ROS, tubular apoptosis, inflammation, and EMT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study designed to explore the feasibility of using ATX, a powerful antioxidant, for IR-induced renal injury. After anesthetization, mice were subjected to renal IR injury as previously described [ Serum were separated by centrifuging blood samples and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis of blood serum urea nitrogen (BUN) and urine creatinine (Cr). Statistical significance was set at As shown in Figure Two time points (12 h after and 24 h after IR procedure) were chosen to evaluate serial changes in serum levels of BUN and Cr. As shown in Figure To determine the effect of ATX on IR-induced renal injury, a histological scoring system base on the typical microscopic features of acute tubular damage including tubular necrosis and dilatation, cast formation, and loss of brush border was adopted (Additional file Levels of SOD and MDA were used to evaluate oxidative stress in kidney. As shown in Figure To investigate IR associated apoptotic cells, we measured TUNEL positive cells in kidney tissues. As shown in Figure MPO activity in kidney tissue and the protein levels of inflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 were used to evaluate inflammation in kidneys after IR procedure. As shown in Figure ELISA detection showed significantly increased expressions of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 in IR group compared with that in sham group, suggesting inflammation in kidney 24 h after IR procedure. In the IR + ATX group, the levels of inflammatory cytokines decreased significantly compared with the IR group (Figure \u03b1-SMA positive myofibroblasts are the main actors in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis. Because \u03b1-SMA production is modulated by ROS in some cell lines, we investigated the expression of this myofibroblast marker in our mice model of IR injury. As shown in Figure This study examined the effect of ATX pretreatment on IR-induced renal injury. The results revealed high accumulation of ATX in kidneys [ ATX pretreatment leaded to an impressive protection in IR induced renal injury reflected by significantly increased viability of HTECs (Figure As well demonstrated, the similar molecular structure to \u03b2-carotenoid gives ATX the capacity to scavenge free radicals and protect oxidative damage to cell membranes, cells, and tissues [ As stated in introduction, oxidative stress, a major contributor to the pathogenesis of IR, leads to tubular apoptosis/necrosis and triggers local inflammatory response in IR injury [ Oxidative stress and inflammation caused by IR could induce EMT [ In conclusion, our data showed that pretreatment of ATX was effective in protecting IR-induced acute injury including tubular apoptosis/necrosis, inflammation, and EMT via scavenging free radicals (Additional file Xuefeng Qiu, Kai Fu and Xiaozhi Zhao contributed equally to this work.", "We also found that Naph and/or IR increased the p53-dependent p21 (CIP/WAF1) promoter activity. Noteworthy, our ChIP assay results showed that Naph and IR combined treatment activated the p21 promoter via inhibition of binding of multi-domain proteins, DNMT1, UHRF1 and HDAC1. Apoptosis and cell cycle analyses demonstrated that Naph and IR combined treatment induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Herein, we showed that Naph treatment enhances IR-induced cell cycle arrest and death in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells through the p53-dependent p21 activation mechanism.", "IR-induced DNA damage activated NF-\u03baB in GBM cells which promoted expression of IL-6, IL-8 and Bcl-xL, thereby contributing to cell survival and invasion. Knockdown SENP2 expression enhanced NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO) SUMOylation and NF-\u03baB activity following IR exposure.", "Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) negatively regulates PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is critical for IR development and progression of cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we investigate the role of PTEN in HCV-associated IR and explored the mechanisms by which HCV regulates PTEN. Western blotting was used to detect the levels of insulin signaling pathway components, including insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), phosphorylated IRS-1 (pIRS-1) at serine 307 (Ser307), both phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) and total Akt. Huh7.5.1 cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing PTEN or PTEN shRNA, and IRS-1 and pIRS-1 (Ser307) levels were determined in both HCV-infected and uninfected cells. The pc-JFH1-core plasmid was constructed to explore the underlying mechanisms by which HCV regulated PTEN and therefore IRS-1 levels. HCV infection inhibited the insulin signaling pathway by reducing the levels of IRS-1 and pAkt/Akt while increasing phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser307. The reduction in IRS-1 level observed in HCV-infected cells was rescued to a limited extent by overexpression of PTEN, which in turn slightly reduced pIRS-1 (Ser307) level. In contrast, IRS-1 level were significantly decreased and phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser-307 was strongly enhanced by PTEN knockdown, suggesting that both reduction in IRS-1 level and increase in IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser307 upon HCV infection occurred in a PTEN-dependent manner. HCV infection suppresses the insulin signaling pathway and promotes IR by repressing PTEN, subsequently leading to decreased levels of IRS-1 and increased levels of pIRS-1 at Ser307. The findings provide new insight on the mechanism of HCV-associated IR. HCV infection is prevalent in 1\u20133% of the global population and is a primary cause of liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis, steatosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [ Recently, more studies have revealed that HCV infection appears to interfere with glucose homeostasis and ultimately induce T2DM [ Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is first identified as a tumor suppressor that dephosphorylates both proteins and phosphoinositides [ IRS-1, an adaptor protein for the insulin signaling pathway, undergoes proteasomal degradation and post-translational modification to arrive at a balance between its Tyr/Ser phosphorylation [ Activated Akt can induce phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2), a key component of glycogen synthesis, at the serine residues and thus inactivate its kinase activity, which leads to glycogen production by activation of glycogen synthase [ Because the PI3K/Akt signaling is involved in HCV-mediated IR, we next evaluated whether its negative regulator PTEN also altered its expression pattern during HCV infection. To elucidate this possibility, we detected PTEN expression in HCVcc-infected Huh7.5.1 cells at different multiplicity of infection (M.O.I) for 48 h by western blotting and real-time PCR (Figure To further explore the impact of PTEN expression on the key effector IRS-1 that mediates IR during HCV infection, we examined pIRS-1 and IRS-1 levels in HCV-infected cells in which PTEN was either overexpressed or knocked down by the lentivirus. Compared to IRS-1 expression upon HCV infection in Huh7.5.1 cells and empty vector group, IRS-1 levels were partially rescued, and pIRS-1 levels were slightly reduced by PTEN overexpression regardless of JFH1-based HCVcc infection (Figure To elucidate the underlying mechanism by which HCV regulated PTEN and subsequent IRS-1 levels, Huh7.5.1 cells were transfected with one of the following plasmids: pc-JFH1-core expressing the HCV core protein from the strain JFH1 or pcDNA3.1 as the negative control (Figure Our results demonstrate that HCV 2a infection interferes with the function of IRS-1 via down-regulation of PTEN expression and increase in phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307 inHuh7.5.1 cells. This study uncovered a sequential event in which HCV regulates several critical insulin signaling molecules during its early infection, which partially contributes to the mechanical elucidation of HCV-associated IR. In such infected patients with no or minimal liver fibrosis, IR is the major factor that contributes to the occurrence of T2DM [ PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is pivotal to the complex network of insulin signaling pathways. Activation of PI3K/Akt is a critical step to ensure subsequent phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 and activation of glycogen synthase involved in insulin metabolic effects [ Moreover, previous studies have indicated that HCV infection interferes with the insulin signaling cascade to promote IRS-1 and IRS-2 proteasomal degradation, by inducing the expression of SOCS3 and proinflammatory cytokines [ It has been demonstrated that phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser1101 in the mTOR/S6K1 pathway makes IRS-1 releasing from intracellular complexes, leading to its degradation [ As a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway, PTEN antagonizes insulin-dependent cell signaling, where its down-regulation improves insulin sensitivity. have suggested that HCV infection modifies the insulin signaling pathway by down-regulation of PTEN protein expression via post-transcriptional regulation events, especially in the presence of insulin [ Our results have revealed a central role for PTEN down-regulation in mediating the incidence of IR in HCV 2a-infected or pc-JFH-1-core plasmid transfected hepatocytes. The findings of our study support the recent view that alternation of PTEN expression/activity plays a crucial role in metabolic disorders of the liver [ Previous studies have suggested that IR in patients with chronic hepatitis C accelerates the process of liver disease and impaired sustained virological response to the standard therapy of peginterferon and ribavirin [ Taken together, our results show that HCV infection triggers IR in a PTEN-dependent manner. The role of PTEN in HCV-associated IR is to promote the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307, resulting in the inhibition of the function of IRS-1. The findings provide new insight into the mechanisms of HCV-associated IR. Insulin and antibodies against IRS-1, pIRS-1 (Ser307), PTEN, Akt, pAkt (Ser473), GSK3\u03b2 and pGSK3\u03b2 (Ser9) were purchased from Beyotime, China. The primary antibodies used were anti-IRS-1, Akt, pAkt, PTEN, GSK3\u03b2, pGSK3\u03b2 antibodies (1:500), HCV core (1:1000) and GAPDH antibody (1:2000).", "A Drp1 inhibitor, mdivi-1, administered before IR decreased mitochondrial fragmentation and cardiomyocyte apoptosis significantly and improved cardiac dysfunction induced by renal IR. This study showed that renal IR injury induced fragmentation of mitochondria in a fission-dominant manner with Drp1 activation and subsequent cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the heart. Furthermore, cardiac dysfunction induced by renal IR was improved by Drp1 inhibition.", "We also provide the clinical utility of lipid ratios to identify men and women with IR. Insulin resistance was defined by homeostatic model assessment of IR > 2.69. In normal-weight men, none of lipid ratios nor TG was associated with IR. In overweight/obese men, normal-weight women and overweight/obese women, the TG/HDL-C, the TC/HDL-C and TG were significantly associated with IR, and the associations were independent of waist circumference. The TG/HDL-C, the TC/HDL-C and TG are associated with IR in overweight/obese men, normal-weight and overweight/obese women. The LDL-C/HDL-C is only associated with IR in normal-weight women. The TG/HDL-C and TG might be used as surrogate markers for assessing IR. One study indicated that the low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)/HDL-C ratio might be the best reliable marker of IR in non-obese Japanese adults [ The aim of the present study is to explore the associations of lipid ratios and TG with IR in a Chinese population. We also provide the clinical utility of lipid ratios to identify men and women with IR. We used HOMA-IR to assess IR. One previous study indicated that the association of the TG/HDL-C ratio with IR might be sex-dependant [ Insulin resistance exists not only in obese individuals but also in individuals with normal weight [ To explore whether lipid ratios and TG are associated with IR in Chinese individuals, logistic regression models were used and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Insulin resistance was defined as HOMA-IR > 2.69 and insulin sensitivity was defined if HOMA-IR < or = 2.69 [ We used HOMA-IR as a continuous variable to examine the correlations of HOMA-IR with the lipid ratios and TG. All variables with a skewed distribution including HOMA-IR, TG, the TG/HDL-C ratio, the TC/HDL-C ratio and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio were logarithmically transformed in the regression models. We also run the full models to explore the associations of TG/HDL-C ratio with IR in the whole population. The p-values for the interaction terms of sex* TG/HDL-C ratio and BMI category* TG/HDL-C ratio in the full models of IR were explored. Insulin resistance is mostly caused by abdominal obesity and waist circumference is used as an alternative method to assess IR [ Youden\u2019s index was calculated as (specificity + sensitivity \u22121) and used to select the optimal cut-offs for each lipid ratio and TG. Characteristics of male and female subjects in different BMI categories were presented in HOMA-IR: Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance; TC: total cholesterol; TG: triglyceride; HDL-C: high density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C: low density lipoprotein cholesterol Analyses were used to explore the differences in study characteristics between normal and overweight subjects within each sex The association of the TG/HDL-C ratio and IR was first explored in the whole population. * Adjusted for age, current smoker, current alcohol use, physical inactivity, education attainment, blood pressure and waist circumference The TG/HDL-C ratio, the TC/HDL-C ratio and TG were associated with IR in overweight/obese men and both normal-weight and overweight/obese women. The LDL-C/HDL-C ratio was associated with IR in normal\u2014weight women. In normal-weight men, none of lipid ratios nor TG was associated with IR. In normal-weight men, none of lipid ratios nor serum TG was associated with IR in the adjusted models. In overweight/obese men, the TG/HDL-C ratio, the TC/HDL-C ratio and TG were significant associated with IR, and the associations were independent of waist circumference and other potential confounders. In normal-weight women, all of lipid ratios and TG were significantly associated with IR and the associations were independent of other confounders. In overweight/obese women, the TG/HDL-C ratio, the TC/HDL-C ratio, and TG were associated with IR. When HOMA-IR was used as a continuous variable in the adjusted regression models, TG, the TG/HDL-C ratio and the TC/HDL-C ratio were significantly association with HOMA-IR in both the normal-weight or overweight/obese men and women (P < 0.05). The Pearson correlation coefficient between TG and HOMA-IR was 0.32\u20130.37. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the TG/HDL-C ratio and HOMA-IR was 0.33\u20130.41. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the TC/HDL-C ratio and HOMA-IR was 0.24\u20130.33. The LDL-C/HDL-C ratio was only associated with HOMA-IR in normal-weight women (The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.07\u20130.22). In logistic regression models, waist circumference was associated with IR in normal-weight men (not shown in the table). The AUROC for waist circumference was 0.71 (95% CI 0.61\u20130.81) ( * Adjusted for age, current smoker, current alcohol use, physical inactivity, education attainment, blood pressure, and waist circumference b. AUROC curves for potential markers of HOMA-IR in overweight/obese men. In normal-weight women, waist circumference, the TG/HDL-C ratio, the TC/HDL-C ratio, the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio and TG were suitable predictors for IR. Among four variables, the TG/HDL-C ratio and TG were better predictors for IR than waist circumference and the TC/HDL-C ratio. The TG/HDL-C ratio and TG had significantly higher AUROCs than waist circumference (P < 0.05) ( b. AUROC curves for potential markers of HOMA-IR in overweight/obese women. BMI was also a suitable predictor for IR in men and normal-weight women (the AUROC > 0.7), but it was not better than waist circumference, TG and the TG/HDL-C ratio ( The optimal cut-offs for lipid ratios and TG are listed in The cut-offs for waist circumference were 87 cm in men and 81 cm in women. Men and women had different cut-offs for BMI (25.15 kg/m The results of the present study indicated that the TG/HDL-C ratio, the TC/HDL-C ratio and TG were associated with IR in overweight/obese men, normal-weight women and overweight/obese women. The LDL-C/HDL-C ratio might not be associated with IR in both men and overweight women. In normal-weight men, none of lipid ratios nor TG was associated with IR. Both elevated TG and low HDL-C are components of metabolic syndrome [ Subsequent studies indicated that the association of the TG/HDL- C ratio with IR might differ by ethnicity and the TG/HDL-C ratio should not be widely used as a suitable predictor of IR in all ethnic groups [ Besides LDL-C and HDL-C which are the primary targets of therapy in most clinical guidelines, other lipoprotein-lipid such as non-HDL-C or apolipoprotein B (apoB) could provide a predictive value [ In the present study, it is shown that the optimal cut-off for the TG/HDL-C ratio is 1.51 (3.48, when using mmol/L/mmol/L) for men and this result is similar to the previous study [ In the present study, we did not use the gold standard method, the hyperinsulinemiceuglycemic clamp, to detect IR. Several alternative methods can be used to detect IR. These methods included HOMA-IR, fasting insulin, Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) [ In the present study, we found that in men with normal weight, none of the lipid ratios nor TG was a reliable marker of IR. Because the sample size is relatively small, the associations of lipid ratios and IG with IR need to be further explored. Waist circumference can be used to predict IR in normal-weight men, and the AUROC for waist circumference was 0.86. In our previous study, it was found that waist circumference is associated with IR and metabolic syndrome in normal-weight subjects [ Other limitations of the present study include two additional points. The main advantages included using three lipid ratios including the TG/HDL-C ratio, the TC/HDL-C ratio and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio and the sample was relatively large compared with previous studies [ The TG/HDL-C ratio, the TC/HDL-C ratio and TG are associated with IR in overweight/obese men and both normal-weight and overweight/obese women. The LDL-C/HDL-C ratio should not be used as a reliable predictor for IR in both men and overweight women. In normal-weight men, none of the lipid ratios nor TG was associated with IR, and waist circumference is significantly associated with IR in normal-weight men. The TG/HDL-C ratio and TG might be recommended as surrogate markers of IR in overweight/obese men, normal-weight and overweight/obese women.", "The sites of NGF secretion from neurons were determined indirectly by analyzing the cell surface bound NGF-IR following depolarization of hippocampal cultures. These authors proposed, based on the pattern of intracellular IR in NT-overexpressing hippocampal neurons, that only BDNF is sorted to the regulated pathway of secretion, whereas NGF and NT-3\u2014when expressed alone\u2014are targeted to constitutively releasing cellular compartments ().", "Although it has been well established that IR exposure activates the ATM kinase domain, the actual mechanism by which ATM responds to damaged DNA has remained enigmatic.", "In CHO-IR cells and adipocytes, Sam68 was tyrosine phosphorylated in response to insulin, and then associated with p85 phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase along with IRS-1. Sam68 was localized mainly in the nucleus of CHO-WT, and both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of CHO-IR cells, but only in the cytoplasm of rat white adipocytes. Insulin stimulation for 16 h enhanced the expression of Sam68 in rat adipocytes and CHO-IR cells. Moreover, CHO-IR cells expressed more Sam68 than CHO-WT, suggesting that overexpression of the IR is enough to induce the expression of Sam68. In summary, these results demonstrate that Sam68 works as a cytoplasmic docking protein which is recruited by IR signaling and whose expression is induced by insulin stimulation, suggesting a putative role for Sam68 in insulin signal transduction.", "In addition, serine 516 was identified as a novel IR-inducible phosphorylation site in vivo and as a site of autophosphorylation in vitro. Interestingly, Chk2 was capable of autoactivation in the absence of IR when overproduced in bacteria, in 293 cells, and in murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking Chk2.", "The morphology revealed evidence for lung edema, hemorrhage and polymorphonuclear sequestration after intestinal IR. Compared with sham group, lung contents of MDA and NO(2)(-)/NO(3)(-) in IR group were significantly increased (12.00+/-2.18 vs 23.44+/-1.25 and 76.39+/-6.08 vs 140.40+/-4.34, P<0.01) and the positive signals of iNOS and NT were also increased in the lung. Compared with IR group, the contents of MDA and NO(2)(-)/NO(3)(-) in IR+AG group were significantly decreased (23.44+/-1.25 vs 14.66+/-1.66 and 140.40+/-4.34 vs 80.00+/-8.56, P<0.01) and NT staining was also decreased. Intestinal IR increases NO and ONOO(-) production in the lung, which may be involved in intestinal IR-mediated lung injury.", "Retinal IR signaling and activity were investigated in vivo in rats that were freely fed, fasted, or injected with insulin by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting and by measuring kinase activity. A retina explant system was utilized to investigate the IR signaling cascade, and immunohistochemistry was used to determine which retinal cell layers respond to insulin. Basal IR activity in the retina was equivalent to that in brain and significantly greater than that of liver, and it remained constant between freely fed and fasted rats. Furthermore, IR signaling increased in the retina after portal vein administration of supraphysiological doses of insulin. Ex vivo retinas responded to 10 nM insulin with IR beta-subunit (IRbeta) and IR substrate-2 (IRS-2) tyrosine phosphorylation and AktSer473 phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that the retinal IR signaling cascade to Akt-1 possesses constitutive activity, and that exogenous insulin further stimulates this prosurvival pathway.", "The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity of CaM kinase II in the subsynaptosomal fractions of neocortex is persistently decreased by up to 85%, despite the increase in CaM kinase II IR. The decrease in activity is more pronounced than the decline in IR, suggesting that CaM kinase II is covalently modified in the postischemic phase.", "Using antibodies to detect the presence of nuclear \u03b3H2AX foci, it was observed that these foci (and their accompanying DSBs) were seen, not only after exposure to IR (IR also acts reactive oxygen species), but also after exposure to classical DSB-inducing agents such as bleomycin and tirapazamine which act the production of free radicals , and etoposide and doxorubicin which prevent topoisomerase II (Top2)-mediated DNA re-ligation. DSBs are highly cytotoxic lesions, and to ensure that they are repaired with a minimal impact on genome stability, cells initiate a complex DNA damage response which includes the spatial reorganization of DSB repair and signaling proteins into sub-nuclear structures: these are IR-induced foci, which surround DSB sites ( ; ). Most IR-induced foci formation depends on the phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX by ATM and DNA-dependent protein kinases (DNA-PK) . The \u03b3H2AX epitope is bound by a mediator of the DNA damage checkpoint 1 protein (MDC1) which then promotes IR-induced foci formation by other proteins, including the p53 binding protein (53BP1), Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 protein (NBS1), and the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility protein (BRCA1) . BRCA1 recruitment to IR-induced foci requires its interaction with the ubiquitin-binding protein, the receptor associated protein 80 (RAP80) . MDC1 is phosphorylated in an ATM-dependent manner in response to IR . This name arose from the fact that these genes were originally identified from the genetic analysis of IR hypersensitive mutants .", "The tumor tissues had higher expression levels of ErbB2, IGF-1R, EGFR, IR, Akt2 or Stat3, and displayed higher levels of phosphorylated MAP kinase, Akt and Stat3 than the normal tissues ( The six lines with robust colony forming ability (ES2, NIHOVCAR3, SKOV-3, OV-90, TOV-112D, and A2780, Similarly, six cell lines with higher invasion activity ( In monolayer growth assays, OV90, SKOV3 and NIH OVCAR3 were relatively resistant to carboplatin, but most lines were sensitive to rapamycin.", "The IR and IR-signaling proteins are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system ( IR activation has been shown to rescue retinal neurons from apoptosis through a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) cascade ( The IR is highly conserved and the high degree of IR signaling homology between Studies from our laboratory ( Polyclonal anti-IR\u03b2 and anti-tubulin antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All animal work was in strict accordance with the The generation of photoreceptor-specific IR knockout mice has been described previously ( Intact ROS, some containing blebs of inner segments attached through the connecting cilium, were prepared by mechanical detachment from freshly dissected bovine retinas as a suspension in Hanks\u2019 balanced salt solution (Sigma Chemical Co, St. Louis, MO) buffered with 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4)( Light- (LROS) and dark-adapted (DROS) ROS were prepared according to the method described earlier ( Experiments were conducted with wild type and IR knockout mice or with albino Wistar rats. Cultures were then analyzed by phase and fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope with a C-C Phase Contrast Turrent Condenser and a Y-FL Epi-Fluorescence Attachment and by a Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (LSCM; Leica DMIRE2/TSCSP2) with a 63 water objective. Blots were then incubated with anti-IR\u03b2 (1:1000) or anti-opsin (1:10000) or anti-actin (1:1000) for either 1h (opsin and actin) at room temperature or overnight (IR\u03b2) at 4\u00b0 C. Following primary antibody incubations, immunoblots were incubated with HRP-linked secondary antibodies (mouse or rabbit) and developed by ECL according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Statistical significance was determined by Student\u2019s two-tailed To demonstrate that insulin receptors are present in photoreceptor outer segments, we immunolabeled bovine ROS (containing some attached inner segment) with an anti-IR\u03b2 antibody. Immunostaining was found in both outer and inner segments ( To explore the involvement of the IR in axonal outgrowth, we evaluated the effects of the absence of insulin on the development of normal rodent retinal neurons. In insulin-lacking cultures, cytochalasin D disorganized the actin network; actin concentrated in clumps throughout the cell body, neurites and lamellipodia ( In insulin-lacking cultures, amacrine neurons develop abnormal neurites and become apoptotic ( Noteworthy, the disorganization of amacrine neurites in insulin-lacking cultures was not prevented by DHA addition; under these conditions amacrine neurons grew extensive lamellipodia (wide, white-filled arrows in To determine whether the insulin-induced activation of IR signaling is essential for photoreceptor differentiation, we established retinal cultures from IR knockout mice. Mice lacking IR are born with normal features but develop early postnatal diabetes and die of ketoacidosis ( The changes in photoreceptor cell morphology observed in insulin-lacking cultures ( Since actin expression was decreased in IR KO retinas, we investigated whether their abnormal morphology could be due to disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Phalloidin staining of wild type and IR knockout mice photoreceptors revealed a remarkable disorganization of the actin network in photoreceptors from IR knockout mouse retinas; instead of showing the typical fasciculation of actin, found in photoreceptors from wild type mice ( We previously reported that light induces the activation of the retinal IR, and this activation is photoreceptor-specific ( The central observation of this study is that the insulin-lacking cultures, photoreceptors from wild type rat retinas exhibited an abnormal morphology with a wide axon cone and disorganization of the actin and tubulin cytoskeleton. Photoreceptors from IR knockout mouse retinas also exhibited a similar abnormal morphology. These data suggest that IR-signaling pathways regulate actin and tubulin cytoskeletal organization in photoreceptors; they also imply that insulin and DHA activate at least partially overlapping signaling pathways that are essential for the development of normal photoreceptors. It has been recently reported that insulin prevents cone photoreceptor cell death in an animal model of retinitis pigmentosa, suggesting that this phenotype is due to nutrient starvation ( The disorganization of actin cytoskeleton was the detectable phenotype observed in IR-deleted photoreceptors. A reduction in ROS-associated actin (presumably F-actin) was also found in IR knockout mouse retinas compared to wild type mouse retinas. Hence, the occurrence of abnormal axons in IR-deleted photoreceptors and in normal photoreceptors in cultures devoid of insulin might arise from both a deficiency and a disorganization of cytoskeleton structural components. The tubulin disorganization observed in neurons from the IR knockout mice, and in wild type rodents in the absence of insulin, might interfere with actin transport, resulting in an excessive (abnormal) accumulation of actin filaments in the axonal cones. In muscle cells in culture, insulin induces a rapid actin filament reorganization that coincides with plasma membrane ruffling and intense accumulation of pinocytotic vesicles ( DHA promotes the survival and differentiation of photoreceptors by activating the ERK/MAP kinase pathway ( We previously reported that light induces the activation of retinal IR and its downstream effector molecules, PI3K and Akt, in ROS membranes ( As a whole, our present results suggest that multiple trophic factors, among them insulin and DHA, activate different signaling pathways to control actin cytoskeleton in developing photoreceptors and axonal outgrowth. Immunolocalization of IR\u03b2 in dissociated ROS. Immunolabeling with IR\u03b2 (A) and opsin (B). The localization of IR\u03b2 (A) clearly demonstrates the presence of IR\u03b2 in rod photoreceptors. Genotyping of generated photoreceptor-specific IR knockout mice. PCR diagnostic for opsin Abnormal development and differentiation of retina photoreceptors from IR knockout mice. Confocal Nomarsky micrographs of retina photoreceptors from IR deleted (A) and wild type (B) mouse retinas grown in serum-free-chemically defined media for 5 days, showing the increase in width of axonal cones (thin arrow in A, B) from 1.05 \u03bcm in WT to 2 \u03bcm in KO. Percentage of photoreceptors having wider axonal cones in cultures with (+) or without (\u2212) insulin (C) and in cultures obtained from wild-type (IR WT) or knockout (IR KO) mice retinas (D). Confocal fluorescence micrographs of cultures from wild type (E, G, I) and knockout retinas (F,H,J) were labeled with an antibody against IR\u03b2 (green staining in E, F), and fluorescence micrographs of cultures double-labeled with DAPI (blue staining) and an anti-opsin antibody (G, H) or with rhodamine phalloidin (red staining in I, J) to examine the organization of F-actin. Photoreceptors of wild type and IR deleted mice showed intense opsin labeling (G, H), even in their neurites (white arrows). Note that in the wild type cultures, IR\u03b2 occurrence was conspicuous (E), while in IR-deleted cultures it was barely visible (F). Also note the abnormal accumulation of phalloidin in the cell body (short arrows in J) and neurite (white arrow in J) of IR-deleted photoreceptors. insulin receptor phosphoinositide 3-kinase IR beta subunit rod outer segments docosahexaenoic acid", "Experiments using these techniques suggested DNA synthesis was reduced due to inhibition of origin firing at low doses of UV or IR [ Measurement of bulk DNA synthesis by radioactive label incorporation shows that cells respond in a biphasic manner to increasing doses of IR: a steep initial decline at low doses followed by a much more shallow reduction at higher doses ([ The study of checkpoints began with the realization that cell-cycle effects were not a passive consequence of DNA damage itself but an active regulatory response [ The AT RDS phenotype appeared to be primarily origin based. AT cells lacked the steep initial decline in DNA synthesis in response to low doses of IR. Analysis by both alkaline sucrose gradient centrifugation and autoradiography indicated that ATM mutants lacked control of origin firing in response to IR [ The role of ATM in regulating fork progression is less clear. Consistent with this idea, low doses of IR inhibit origin clusters not necessarily directly impacted by DNA damage and episomal DNA synthesis is prevented even when only nuclear DNA damaged by IR [ Significant progress has been made in elucidating the mechanism underlying checkpoint-regulation of origins in higher eukaryotes. Two pathways downstream of ATM are required for robust slowing in response to IR (Figure Direct physical evidence for checkpoint-dependent slowing of fork progression has come from fluorescent DNA fiber analysis, an updated version of the fiber autoradiography. For example, vertebrates slow replication in response to low doses of IR while fission yeast do not [ DNA lesion density may contribute to whether checkpoint-dependent fork slowing is manifest as slowing of bulk replication.", "There is considerable evidence that abnormalities in both IR expression and function may account for malignant transformation and tumour progression in some human neoplasias, including breast cancer. PPAR The peptide hormone insulin regulates the metabolism and growth of most cells [ The interaction between IR and other ligands of the IGF (insulin-like growth factor) system [ Dysfunctional IR signaling is implicated in certain common dysmetabolic disorders, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, the dysmetabolic syndrome X, and the polycystic ovary syndrome [ In target cells the IR has been shown to be under the regulation of hormones, metabolites, and differentiation [ PPAR Studies aimed at understanding whether IR could constitute a target gene for PPAR Thus, overexpression and/or activation of PPAR The IR is critical in the insulin-mediated effects on cell metabolism and cell growth. Various studies have shown that IRs are increased in most human breast cancers, and both ligand-dependent malignant transformation and increased cell growth occur in cultured breast cells overexpressing the IR [ The TZDs are insulin-sensitizing drugs that improve insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Upon binding of insulin, the IR undergoes autophosphorylation which enables the receptor to have a kinase activity and phosphorylates various cytoplasmic substrates, such as IRSs.", "The literature was examined for papers related to the topics of hnRNP, IR and DNA repair. HnRNP orchestrate the processing of mRNA to which they are bound in response to IR. Sixteen different hnRNP proteins have been reported to show either mRNA transcript or protein quantity changes following IR. Various protein modifications of hnRNP in response to IR have also been noted: hnRNP A18, C1/C2 and K are phosphorylated; hnRNP C1/C2 is a target of apoptotic proteases; and hnRNP K degradation is controled by murine double minute ubiquitin ligase (MDM2). Evidence points to a role for hnRNP A1, A18, A2/B1, C1/C2, K and P2 in regulating double-stranded break (DSB) repair pathways by promoting either homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end rejoining (NHEJ) repair pathways following IR. HnRNP proteins play a pivotal role in coordinating repair pathways following exposure to IR, through protein-protein interactions and transcript regulation of key repair and stress response mRNA. In particular, several hnRNP proteins are critical in coordinating the choice of HR or NHEJ to repair DSB caused by IR. IR plays a role in both the induction and the treatment of cancers. Within the cell, exposure to IR may cause direct and indirect DNA damage, genotoxic stress, general transcription arrest and necessitate the initiation of repair pathways ( Double stranded breaks (DSB) in genomic DNA are considered to be the most deleterious form of DNA damage caused by IR. There are many examples in the literature wherein hnRNP proteins have been shown to respond to stresses which may overlap with the effects of IR including ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and various DNA damaging chemicals like cisplatin or phleomycin. Exhaustive study of these citations is the topic for a different review and such data will be used only when they corroborate evidence of IR effects on hnRNP. It was found that telomerase activity is downregulated over a 48 hour period following 30 Gy exposure in Jukat and CEM-6, but not Raji cells ( Immunofluorescence studies have revealed cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP A1, induced following shortwave ultraviolet (UV-C) irradiation (180 J/m Given the cumulative evidence gathered, the simplest explanation for the action of hnRNP A1 is that in response to IR it accumulates in the cytoplasm and stress granules. Given these conclusions, hnRNP A1 may be an important molecule to study to provide targeted treatment for infinitely proliferating cells and to further understand the IR response pathway. Among 7 downregulated proteins identified, they found hnRNP A2/B1 with a four fold lower expression following treatment compared to controls ( It has also been reported that IR can lead to DNA-protein cross links with hnRNP A2/B1 ( Taken together, these results suggest an important and under-characterized role for hnRNP A2/B1 in radiation responses and cancer development specifically through the repair of DSB. The response is general, apparently encompassing stresses ranging from IR to heat-shock ( An hnRNP A/B type transcript (accession number NM_010448) was identified by microarray among 69 downregulated transcripts in isolated bone marrow cells from C57BL mice 6 hours after a whole body Co-60 \u03b3-irradiation with 6.5 Gy. This transcript was 3 fold lower in irradiated than in control mice ( Another hnRNP A/B type transcript (accession number M65028) was identified by microarray among 126 other radiation responsive transcripts, in a screen of pooled lymphoblasts from 10 individuals ( HnRNP A3 was identified among 29 proteins in a DNAzol-Strip screen for DNA protein crosslinks following 1 Gy ionizing irradiation under hypoxic or aerated conditions in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells ( HnRNP C1 and hnRNP C2 are splice variants which differ by a 13 amino acid stretch present in the middle of the coding sequence of the C2 gene ( HnRNP C1/C2 can be isolated in screens for both DNA protein crosslinks and chromatin-binding proteins following IR. DNA crosslinking was observed one hour following treatment with moderate doses of Co-60 \u03b3-IR (1-4 Gy) in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO AA8) and human fibroblast cells (GM00637) especially under hypoxic conditions ( A different report has indicated that hnRNP C1/C2 undergoes cleavage as the result of activation of the apoptotic proteases at 8 hours post treatment by high doses of IR (20 Gy) in Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma cells, BL30A (Waterhouse et al.). Two microarray studies have indicated a change in expression levels of hnRNP C1/C2 transcripts following IR treatment. One study showed that hnRNP C1/C2 binds to Ku protein if it is at the same time binding RNA transcripts and can be phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of the DNA-PK complex ( It is intriguing to speculate that the previously mentioned responses of hnRNP C1/C2 to IR are responsible for regulation of DDR pathways induced by IR and general maintenance of genomic stability. HnRNP K has been implicated in the processes of chromatin remodeling and mRNA transcription, splicing, export and translation ( While p53\u2019s role in cell-cycle checkpoint arrest and the DDR pathway was identified 15 years ago by Lane et al ( Proteomic analysis first identified hnRNP K among upregulated proteins in GM 14680 cells treated with 20 Gy of \u03b3-IR. Subsequent immunoblot experiments revealed that hnRNP K protein levels increased 2-3 fold 15 minutes after treatment with IR or the radiomimetic drug phleomycin ( Through siRNA knockdown experiments in SAOS2 cells Moumen et al. Of these, only UV (25 J/m Interestingly, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (CHiP) assays indicated that hnRNP K and p53 are co-recruited to p53 responsive promoters and that hnRNP K acts to regulate mRNA targets of p53 controlled genes ( Because p53 plays a critical role in cell cycle arrest following an IR event, the authors went on to explore the role that hnRNP K might play in facilitating this p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. HnRNP K is one of downstream targets of ATR/ATM phosphorylation and HDM2 mediated degradation pathways ( Given the relationship between hnRNP K, p53 and the transcript targets of p53, it is not surprising that hnRNP K overexpression has been linked to multiple forms of cancer ( Protein hnRNP P2 more commonly known as translocation/fusion protein (TLS/FUS) ( Transgenic hnRNP P2 The authors have proposed that hnRNP P2 may play a role in homologous DNA pairing and recombination, key aspects of HR repair ( During the course of research a number of references were collected that showed a link between hnRNP transcript induction and IR, but did not fit with a greater body of evidence. Some hnRNP are more represented than others when associated with gene expression changes following IR. Namely hnRNP E gene family members were each differentially regulated in three IR studies; hnRNP H, R and U were each noted in two studies; and hnRNP D, L and M were noted in only one study each. From the evidence accumulated, it is clear that hnRNP are critical regulatory proteins in the cellular response to IR and other stresses. The most commonly observed effect of IR on hnRNP was transcript or protein induction. Sixteen hnRNP, A1, A2/B1, A18, AB Type (NM_010448), AB Type (M65028), C1/C2, D, E1, E2, H1, H3, K, L, M, R and U were noted in various studies as being IR inducible mRNA. Rather, the induction effects thus far noted may serve as fruitful jumping off points for future research, especially in the cases of hnRNP E, H, R and U which have each been noted in multiple induction studies following IR, but lack followup research to describe the relevant DDR pathways they might connect to. While hnRNP are characterized primarily as RNA transcript processing agents, there is a surprising lack of evidence of hnRNP relocalization to the cytoplasm or stress granules following IR treatment. HnRNP A1 and B1 relocalization has been noted in response to a variety of stresses, including UV, but not to IR treatment specifically ( The most important evidence to emerge from the literature reviewed in this paper demonstrates that hnRNP function as upstream and co-dependent regulators of critical DDR proteins. HnRNP K has been shown to act as a critical co-factor of p53, necessary for p53-dependent cell cycle checkpoints and p53-dependent transcript induction following IR treatment. UV and IR have been shown to produce positive or negative induction of hnRNP B1 ( In light of the above associations between hnRNP and critical components of DDR, it is not surprising that mutations in a number of these proteins, hnRNP A18, B1, K, P2 and L, have been linked to cancer and radiosensitivity ( NHEJ repairs DSB through an error prone mechanism available at any point during the cell cycle. UV and IR are known to induce hnRNP A2/B1 protein which has been proposed to inhibit DNA-PK ( HR repairs DSB using the broken strand\u2019s sister chromatid as a template.", "IR isoform A mRNA was 13-fold more expressed than IR isoform B. IR and IGF1R co-precipitated, indicating the presence of hybrid IR/IGF1R. IR beta-subunit was phosphorylated by IGF1 10(-8) mol/l but not by insulin. IGF1 stimulated IR substrate-1 and AKT at 10(-8) mol/l and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 at 10(-9)-10(-8) mol/l respectively. Our results suggest that IGF1R and hybrid IR/IGF1R are activated by physiological concentrations of IGF1 and 2 in HASMC and this propagates downstream signaling and biological effects, while insulin has no effect on its receptor or downstream signaling probably due to a preponderance of IGF1R and incorporation of IR into hybrid IR/IGF1R.", "Therefore, in the present studies on Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing wild-type IR-PTK (CHO-IR) or a PTK-inactive form of IR (CHO-1018), we investigated whether IR-PTK plays a role in H2O2-induced signaling events. Treatment of CHO-IR cells with H2O2 increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), protein kinase B (PKB), and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta while enhancing tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR-beta subunit and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Compared with CHO-IR cells, the stimulatory effect of H2O2 on ERK1/2 and PKB was partially reduced in CHO-1018 cells. Taken together, these data suggest that both IR-PTK and Src family PTKs contribute to H2O2-induced signaling in CHO-IR cells albeit IR-PTK has a less dominant role in this process.", "We examined the effect of insulin sensitizer (rosiglitazone) on FFA-induced IR. At 0 wk, TG-Hep infusion caused a decrease in glucose infusion rate (GIR) from 4.49 +/- 0.95 mg/kg.min to 3.02 +/- 0.59 mg/kg.min (P = 0.018). Rosiglitazone treatment resulted in an increase in baseline GIR to 6.29 +/- 0.81 mg/kg.min (P = 0.03 vs. 0 wk), which decreased to 4.52 +/- 0.53 mg/kg.min (P = 0.001) after 6 h of TG-Hep infusion. The decrease in GIR induced by TG-Hep infusion was similar before and after rosiglitazone therapy [1.47 +/- 0.50 vs. 1.77 0.3 mg/kg.min (28.9 +/- 6.5 vs. 26.4 +/- 3.7%); P = 0.51]. We conclude that rosiglitazone: 1) causes a significant increase in GIR; 2) induces a decrease in inflammatory mediators, C-reactive protein, and serum amyloid A; 3) decreases the rise in FFAs and triglycerides after TG-Hep infusion; and 4) does not prevent FFA-induced IR.", "Accordingly, we studied if scavengers of either O(2)(-) or NO, or a compound that was reported to attenuate cardiac production of peroxynitrite, would prevent endothelial injury and subsequent PNM adhesion in IR heart. IR impaired the ACh, but not SNP, response by approximately 60%, caused endothelium-glycocalyx disruption, and approximately nine-fold increase in PMN adhesion. The data imply that PMN adhesion in IR guinea-pig heart is a process secondary to functional and/or structural changes in coronary endothelium, and that a toxic product of the reaction between superoxide and NO mediates these endothelial changes.", "Gefitinib pretreatment induced multinucleated cells after IR exposure in NCI-H460 and VMRC-LCD, but not in A549 cells. Gefitinib also inhibited activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) after IR-exposure in NCI-H460 and VMRC-LCD, but not in A549 cells. An ATM specific inhibitor increased IR-induced multinucleated cells in both NCI-H460 and A549 cells. Gefitinib pretreatment inhibited the gradual decrease of \u03b3H2AX foci relative to time after IR exposure in NCI-H460 but not in A549 cells. Suppression of COX-2 in A549 cells induced multinucleated cells and caused radiosensitization after gefitinib+IR treatment. However, concurrent chemo-radiation therapy is frequently toxic and a significant number of patients suffer from complications such as radiation esophagitis and radiation pneumonitis during or after this treatment [ In this study, we investigated how gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa In our previous report [ We previously proposed that inhibition of Chk2 phosphorylation may be an underlying mechanism for radiosensitization by gefitinib [ Cancer cells severely damaged by IR are known to undergo MC or mitotic cell death (MCD) which is characterized by the formation of micronuclei and/or multinuclei [ To test whether gefitinib pretreatment increases MC after IR exposure, cells were stained with DAPI to visualize the nuclear morphology after gefitinib plus IR treatment. After gefitinib pretreatment followed by 6Gy IR exposure, the number of multinucleated cells increased dramatically in NCI-H460 and VMRC-LCD as compared to IR treatment alone. In contrast, multinucleated cells were not observed in A549 cells before or after the same treatment (Figure The G To test whether another EGFR inhibitor would also block IR-induced ATM/Chk2 phosphorylation, we performed the same experiments using cetuximab, which is a monoclonal antibody raised against EGFR. In the three cell lines tested, ATM and Chk2 were phosphorylated immediately after exposure to IR. However, in contrast to gefitinib, IR-induced ATM and Chk2 phosphorylation were not inhibited when cells were pretreated with cetuximab before IR exposure (Additional file To test the role of gefitinib pretreatment on IR-induced DNA damage, we performed immunofluorescent staining with anti-\u03b3H2AX antibody followed by confocal microscopic evaluation to observe the change in the number of \u03b3H2AX foci, a marker for DNA double strand breaks, after exposure to IR [ The G Collectively, gefitinib may radiosensitize NCI-H460 cells by inhibiting ATM phosphorylation and repair of damaged DNA after IR exposure, and thereby increasing multinucleated cell formation. In contrast, gefitinib may not be able to radiosensitize A549 cells because it does not inhibit IR-induced ATM phosphorylation in these cells and therefore cannot induce multinucleated cell formation and MC. We previously reported that COX-2-overexpressing cells showed resistance to gefitinib's antineoplastic activity [ To further test the effect of COX-2 expression on multinucleated cell formation, the number of multinucleated cells was counted in COX-2-overexpressing or -suppressed cells after gefitinib plus IR treatment. In H460-COX2 cells, the number of gefitinib+IR-induced multinucleated cells was decreased significantly compared to H460-Mock cells (Figure In the current study, we showed that gefitinib, an orally given EGFR inhibitor that is used currently to treat patients with NSCLC, can radiosensitize NSCLC cells by inhibiting ATM activity which would otherwise promote repair of damaged DNA and prevents MC after IR exposure. Gefitinib inhibited IR-induced ATM phosphorylation in the two NSCLC cell lines (NCI-H460 and VMRC-LCD) that were radiosensitized by this agent, but IR-induced ATM phosphorylation was intact after gefitinib pretreatment in an NSCLC cell line (A549) that was not radiosensitized by this drug. Gefitinib also inhibited repair of DNA double strand breaks and increased multinucleated cell formation after IR exposure in the two former cell lines while it did not in the A549 cell line. We additionally showed that an ATM-specific inhibitor, Ku55933, induced multinucleated cell formation after IR exposure in both NCI-H460 and A549 cells. However, cetuximab did not affect the phosphorylation level of ATM after IR exposure even though it significantly reduced EGFR activity as well as gefitinib did. Suppression of COX-2 in A549 cells allowed for the induction of MC and radiosensitization after gefitinib plus IR treatment, while COX-2 overexpression in NCI-H460 cells reduced MC-induction and the degree of radiosensitization achieved with same treatment (Figure How COX-2 can induce this resistance to gefitinib is currently unclear. Recently, we reported that COX-2 overexpressing cancer cells upregulate ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related (ATR) expression and activity, and that upregulated ATR induces resistance to DNA damaging agents such as IR or hydroxyurea [ In conclusion, we propose that gefitinib radiosensitizes NSCLC cells through inhibiting IR-induced ATM activation, and therefore acts as a G Gefitinib was provided by AstraZeneca UK Ltd. (London, United Kingdom), Cetuximab was provided by Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), Ku55933, an ATM kinase specific inhibitor, was acquired from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). Cyclooxygenase(COX)-2 knocked down A549 cells by RNA interference [ The effectiveness of the combined treatment with gefitinib and IR was assessed by clonogenic survival assays as described previously [ To analyze cell cycle, 1.5 ~ 3 \u00d7 10 Cells were grown on coverslips, treated with 15 \u03bcmol/L gefitinib or vehicle (DMSO) for 48 h and then exposed to 6 Gy of \u03b3-rays.", "", "In double labeling preparations, BACE1 IR colocalized with immunolabeling for A\u03b2 but not for phosphorylated tau. In perfusion-fixed monkey cortex, locally increased BACE1 IR co-existed with intra-axonal and extracellular A\u03b2 IR among virtually all neuritic plaques ranging from primitive to typical cored forms. A total of 17 cases of clinically-diagnosed AD or with a history of dementia (>3 years) and 14 non-demented cases, with postmortem delay ranged from 3 to 40 hours, were used for initial neuropathological screen using Bielschowsky silver stain, and phosphorylated tau ( Rhesus monkey ( Human cortical samples were blocked to contain the cortex and white matter with an approximate volume of 1.5 (depth, relative to pia) \u00d7 2 (width) \u00d7 1 (thickness) cm For comparative qualitative and quantitative analyses, consecutive sets of sections (40 \u03bcm thick) from a set of AD (3-4 cases/batch) and control (3-4 cases/batch) cases were immunostained for BACE1 and two different A\u03b2 antibodies (E50, 12F4 or 6E10, densitometry was based on 6E10 IR) with the peroxidase-3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) method. of BACE1 and A\u03b2 IR in the human cortex, expressed as digital light units (DLU)/mm Normal BACE1 expression pattern in representative primate forebrain structures was assessed in the plaque-free monkey (mid-age) brains by immunohistochemistry, using a rabbit antibody (anti-BACE1\u03b1) raised against the N-terminal 46-163 amino acids of human BACE1 ( In the rodent olfactory pathway BACE1 expression is inversely correlated with metabolic activity under normal conditions and following functional deprivation ( Western blot analyses were carried out using temporal cortical homogenates to confirm elevated levels of some AD-related protein products in pathologically verified AD (n=7) relative to control (n=7) human cortices, and in aged monkey cortices with (n=3), relative to those without (n=4), cerebral plaque pathology (no tauopathy was found in any of the examined monkey brains) ( Increased BACE1 IR (referred to as BACE1 \u201celevation\u201d hereafter, relative to background staining and based on the above biochemical data) arranged as localized profiles were consistently detected in AD and aged monkey cortex that contained amyloid plaques immunolabeled by various antibodies targeting the N-terminal or C-terminal amino acids of the A\u03b2 domain ( In AD cortex with relatively mild plaque pathology (3 out of 7 cases), BACE1-labeled elements appeared to spatially match with amyloid plaques in adjacent sections (40 \u03bcm-thick) in most cases, particularly evident for the large-sized profiles ( In dual-chromogen double labeling preparations (20 \u03bcm-thick sections), BACE1 IR and A\u03b2 IR often co-existed locally forming compact-like plaques in AD cortex with mild to moderate plaque lesions ( We attempted to profile BACE1 IR using double immunofluorescence in AD cortex, but encountered disturbing lipofuscin autofluorescence and could only obtained limited usable data ( Mirror sections (20 \u03bcm-thick) from the temporal lobe of aged monkey were stained for BACE1 and A\u03b2 to confirm a localized occurrence of BACE1/A\u03b2 expressing neuritic plaques. BACE1-labeled profiles appeared to colocalize in most cases with amyloid plaques presumably containing A\u03b240 ( Double immunofluorescence was used to study the details of BACE1 IR relative to A\u03b2 IR around plaques. BACE1 IR appeared to coexist locally with A\u03b2 IR visualized by 3D6 ( It should be emphasized that weak A\u03b2 IR also existed inside the BACE1-labeled swollen neurites. Compared to control cortex that exhibits essentially diffuse neuropil reactivity, increased BACE1 IR occurs clearly and site-specifically in plaque-bearing primate cortex, and co-exists locally with A\u03b2 IR in aged monkey cortex, and in AD cases with relatively mild plaque lesions. This increased BACE1 IR localizes to swollen and sprouting neuronal processes characteristic of dystrophic axons ( Our densitometric analysis shows an overall correlation between specific densities of BACE1 IR and A\u03b2 IR among the AD cases or across cortical areas irrespective of individual cases. However, BACE1 IR density may not match to the extent of A\u03b2 density in presumed late- or end-stage AD samples. Also, by comparing labelings in adjacent sections, we noticed that the amount of BACE1 IR could be much less relative to A\u03b2 IR among some plaque profiles. Thus, BACE1 IR associated with a fairly dense A\u03b2 plaque may appear as a cluster of small dot-like or fibrous labelings. These findings imply that amyloid plaques may eventually evolve into a \u201cburn-out\u201d end stage ( Double labelings for BACE1 with axonal and dendritic (SYN, GAP43, MAP2) markers show a clear localization of increased BACE1 IR to swollen/sprouting axon terminals, or axonal dystrophic neurites in transgenic mouse, aged monkey and AD human brains ( The finding that A\u03b2 overproduction and potential accumulation occur early inside axon terminals might be of important pathophysiological relevance in light of the toxic effect of A\u03b2 products on synapses ( Whether amyloid and tau pathologies are parallel or interactive in AD pathogenesis remains unsettled ( It is well-established that senile plaques distribute preferentially around blood vessels ( In summary, the present study shows that in aged monkey and AD human cerebral cortices BACE1 elevation occurs in the swollen and sprouting axonal terminals of the neuritic plaques. BACE1 IR occurs generally in the neuropil across the temporal lobe regions including the subiculum (Sub), inferior and medial temporal gyri (ITG, MTG) and hippocampus CA1 and CA2 sectors (A). BACE1 IR in the dentate gyrus (DG) distinctly delineates the mossy fiber (mf) pathway in the hilus extending along CA3 and ending at the CA3/CA2 border (B, C). The laminar distribution pattern of BACE1 IR changes abruptly at the border between areas 17 and 18. BACE1 IR in lamina III/IVa appears as regularly-spaced alternating zones/compartments with low and high intensities, which are complementary to CO reactivities in the blob and interblob zones (E-H). (A-H) show representative images of BACE1 and A\u03b2 IR in consecutive temporal cortical sections from AD cases with varying plaque pathology. In control cortical sections, BACE1 (I) and A\u03b2 (not shown) IR appears as weak and diffuse background staining. Therefore, the mean optic density of BACE1 or A\u03b2 IR obtained from batch-processed control sections is used as the cut-off threshold to define the specific densities in the AD cortical sections (I, K). Panel (J) plots the specific densities (mean \u00b1 S.D., from 4 microscopic fields per brain) of BACE1/A\u03b2 IR measured in the temporal cortex among the 7 AD cases. A centroperipheral gradient of high to low A\u03b2 IR around cored plaques is illustrated by using a short (30 miniseconds, H) and slightly longer (100 miniseconds, I) exposure for A\u03b2 imaging. BACE1 and A\u03b2 IR may colocalize inside small isolated swollen processes that are not surrounded by clear extracellular A\u03b2 deposits (profiles pointed by arrows in E-G).

Upon IR, cells were harvested and fixed, first in 1.5% Formaldehyde and afterwards in ice cold 70% ethanol. In patients suffering from head and neck cancer, this was seen in four out of five pairs (see The three participating laboratories observed a highly significant dose-dependent increase of IR-induced apoptosis in the individual samples to a very similar extent. As has been reported previously, the Annexin V/PI assay failed to detect Annexin V-positive and Annexin V/PI-double-positive cells in immortalised lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) upon irradiation with low doses of IR In the interlaboratory analysis, the reliability of the Annexin V/PI-based apoptosis assay was tested. The investigation of the corresponding EBV-immortalised LCLs showed less overall IR-induced H2AX phosphorylation than the corresponding PBLs in both laboratories ( The comparison of the cellular \u03b3H2AX-fluorescence levels with clinical radiosensitivity of the respective patients showed no clear phenotypic correlation, neither for the PBLs nor for the LCLs in either laboratory.

In conclusion, although treatments with cobra venom factor and C5a receptor antagonist were able to protect mice from local tissue damage, treatment with C5a receptor antagonist was not able to protect mice from remote lung tissue damage, implying that more factors contribute to the development of remote tissue damage after IR injury.

( Peripheral IR, a decrease in insulin-mediated glucose disposal, is thought to represent the earliest derangement in glucose metabolism preceding the onset of diabetes. ( However, the vast majority of studies evaluating IR in HCV have utilized surrogate estimates of IR, as opposed to direct quantification of insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Indeed, we have shown that surrogate measures of IR, when correlated to the direct measure of insulin-medicated glucose disposal, can be impacted by degrees of obesity and ethnicity. ( The goal of this prospective study was to build upon these findings by performing a comprehensive evaluation of IR using direct quantification of resistance to insulin-mediated glucose uptake in the peripheral tissues (mainly muscle) using the IST in the largest cohort of non-diabetic, non-cirrhotic HCV subjects described to date. On multivariable analysis, when controlling for the presence of IR at baseline, current tobacco use (Coef 55, 95%CI 19-90, p=0.0025) and presence of steatosis (Coef -44, 95%CI -86 to -3, p=0.038) were independently associated with a change in SSPG. When evaluating the impact of changes in patient characteristics and serologic studies on change in SSPG, increases in AST levels (Coef 2.5 per 10 units/L, 95%CI 0.6-4.5, p=0.01), LDL levels (Coef 6.4 per 10 mg/dL, 95%CI 0.7-12.1, p=0.029), and BMI (Coef 21 per 5 kg/m This study describes the largest cohort of HCV-infected individuals to undergo comprehensive metabolic evaluation including direct measurement of IR to date. In this non-diabetic and non-cirrhotic HCV cohort, there was a wide distribution of insulin sensitivity, and overall, the degree of peripheral IR remained stable on follow-up evaluation. IR was positively associated with Latino race/ethnicity, increasing BMI, and increasing serum ferritin levels and negatively associated with male gender and higher HDL levels. Viral factors including HCV viral load and genotype did not appear to influence IR significantly. Previous studies have demonstrated an association between HCV infection and IR. In particular, HCV has been reported to reduce insulin-mediated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and Akt ( We have shown that similar to the general population, there is a wide spectrum of peripheral insulin sensitivity in the HCV population. Approximately 25% of study subjects had levels of peripheral IR shown to be associated with negative clinical sequelae in the general population. This rate is lower than those observed in studies of HCV-infected non-diabetic patients with similar patient selection criteria that utilized the surrogate measurement of IR, HOMA-IR, with reported rates ranging from 32 to 54%. ( The complex interplay between host and viral factors underlying the development of IR in HCV is poorly understood. With respect to host factors, Latinos and African Americans are known to be at increased risk for diabetes( Previously reported HCV-related factors associated with IR include HCV viral load, genotype, and higher degrees of steatosis and fibrosis on histologic evaluation of the liver. ( Importantly, this study assessed baseline factors influencing changes in IR over time. Consistent with studies in the general population( This study contributes significantly to our understanding of peripheral IR in HCV, including factors associated with IR and its change on follow-up testing. The main goal of this study was to accurately describe the distribution of IR in HCV, and as such, a control group of HCV-uninfected individuals were not included. In addition, evaluation of the natural history of IR in HCV requires a longer follow-up period, but this may not be feasible given the current availability of effective HCV anti-viral therapy and the challenge of controlling for the confounding effect of worsening liver disease itself on insulin action. In summary, there was a wide distribution of IR in our HCV population, and approximately 25% of HCV-infected patients were significantly insulin-resistant. Therefore, interventions directed towards addressing modifiable risk factors for IR are critical to the prevention of diabetes in this population.", "The IR tyrosine kinase is activated upon insulin binding, resulting in the phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins including insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2 (). Phenotypes of IRS-1- and IRS-2-knockout-mice suggest that these proteins have a crucial role in the coordination of the effects of insulin on peripheral metabolism (). The phosphorylated tyrosines in IRS-1 and IRS-2 act as docking sites for various signaling molecules including phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (). The binding of tyrosine phosphorylated IRS-1 and IRS-2 to the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase results in the activation of this enzyme (). In a previous study, we have investigated the insulin signaling system in liver of these animals and found that it was enhanced, as demonstrated by an up-regulation of the IR, IRS-1 and IRS-2 in this tissue (). In a study published at approximately the same time, up-regulation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 was found in liver of young Snell dwarf mice (). In aged Snell dwarfs the IRS-1 pool level increased further while the IRS-2 pool level showed a remarkable decrease (). The in vivo phosphorylation of the IR, IRS-1 and IRS-2, the association of IRS-1 and -2 with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, the phosphotyrosine-derived activity of PI 3-kinase as well as the phosphorylation level of Ser473 of Akt after insulin stimulation were evaluated in this tissue. The monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (\u03b1PY, PY99) and the polyclonal anti-insulin receptor \u03b2-subunit antibody (\u03b1IR, C-19) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The anti-rat carboxy-terminal IRS-1 antibody (\u03b1IRS-1), the anti-rat carboxy-terminal IRS-2 antibody (\u03b1IRS-2) and the antibody to the p85 subunit of PI-3-kinase (\u03b1p85) were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY, USA). Equal amounts of muscle protein were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with \u03b1IR, \u03b1IRS-1 or \u03b1IRS-2 (4 \u03bcg/ml final concentration for all antibodies). The membranes were then incubated for 4 h at room temperature with \u03b1PY (1 \u03bcg/ml), \u03b1IR (1 \u03bcg/ml), \u03b1IRS-1 (1 \u03bcg/ml) or \u03b1IRS-2 (1.5 \u03bcg/ml). The amount of the p85 subunit of the PI 3-kinase in \u03b1IRS-1 or \u03b1IRS-2 immunoprecipitates was evaluated by stripping the membranes and reblotting as previously described (). After in vivo insulin stimulation the extent of IR phosphorylation as determined by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was reduced by 55% in skeletal muscle of Ames dwarf mice (<0.01) relative to normal mice ( , A and B). IR protein levels were slightly but not statistically significantly decreased in Ames dwarf mice as compared with controls (, C and D). In both groups of animals insulin administration resulted in an increase in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. However, in Ames dwarf mice the level of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation reached after stimulation with insulin was reduced by 79% (<0.001) as compared with their control littermates (, A and B). Basal IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation was barely detectable in both control and dwarf mice ( , A and B). The level of IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation after insulin stimulation was reduced by 51% (<0.01) in Ames dwarf mice (, A and B) relative to normal animals. IRS-1 protein levels were decreased by 66% (<0.001) (, C and D), while IRS-2 was decreased by 43% (<0.001) relative to normal animals (, C and D). In control mice, insulin stimulation resulted in an important increase in the association of p85 with IRS-1 ( , A and B) and in the amount of p85 associated with IRS-2 (, C and D). After insulin stimulation the amount of p85 associated with IRS-1 was reduced by 80% (<0.01) compared with control animals (, A and B). As shown if , C and D, the amount of p85 associated to IRS-2 reached after insulin stimulation was also lower than that detected in the control group (41% reduction; <0.05). To determine whether the reduction in insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity and p85 association with the IRS phosphoproteins in dwarf mice was associated with changes in the content of p85, homogenates of skeletal muscle were immunoblotted with p85 antibodies. With the exception of the IR levels which were not significantly altered, a significant reduction was found in the expression of IRS-1, IRS-2 and p85 in this tissue. Moreover, a reduced response to a high dose of insulin in terms of IR, IRS-1 and IRS-2 phosphorylation, p85-IRS-1/IRS-2 association, PI 3-kinase activity and Akt activation was detected. Young Snell dwarfs (3\u20136 months of age) exhibit a large increase in the IRS-1 pool levels and particularly in the IRS-2 pool levels in this tissue, while in comparison to age-matched controls, old (20\u201323 months of age) Snell dwarfs exhibit a further increase in the IRS-1 pool levels together with a dramatic decrease in the content of IRS-2 (). The phosphorylation of the IR, IRS-1 and IRS-2, together with the p85-IRS association and the activity of PI 3-kinase under basal conditions were found to be decreased in Snell dwarf mice (). Data showing reduced basal insulin signaling in young Snell dwarf mice does not contradict these results since important increases in the hepatic expression of IRS-1 and IRS-2 were found (). The reduced expression of IRS-1, IRS-2 and p85 together with the limited maximal capacity of insulin response in skeletal muscle of these animals could represent a physiological mechanism to avoid severe hypoglycemia and may be important for the control of glucose homeostasis and also for longevity.", "The ATM-dependent activation of CHK2 by IR was defective in NBS cells but was restored by ectopic expression of wild-type NBS1. The defects in ATM-dependent activation of CHK2, S phase checkpoint control, IR-induced nuclear focus formation, and radiation sensitivity apparent in NBS cells were not corrected by expression of NBS1 mutants that lack an intact MRE11 binding domain, suggesting that formation of the NBS1-MRE11-RAD50 complex is required for the corresponding normal phenotypes. Expression of NBS1 proteins with mutated ATM-targeted phosphorylation sites (serines 278 or 343) did not restore S phase checkpoint control but did restore the ability of IR to activate CHK2 and to induce nuclear focus formation and normalized the radiation sensitivity of NBS cells. Together, these data demonstrate that multiple functional domains of NBS1 are required for ATM-dependent activation of CHK2, nuclear focus formation, S phase checkpoint control, and cell survival after exposure to IR.", "These findings are consistent with immunochemical studies with 10E4 antibody in which we show that QSulf1 expression remodels the 10E4 IR on the surface of expressing cells.

In the ventrolateral medulla (; area E in ), TH-IR neurons are located posterior to the inferior olive, lying in the vicinity of and within the lateral reticular nucleus and the ambiguus nucleus. This cluster of TH-IR neurons is mainly found close to the ventrolateral surface of the medulla, but scattered intermediate neurons (area D in ) extend dorsomedially towards the regions of the dorsal vagal nucleus and hypoglossal nucleus. The ventrolateral TH-IR cell cluster is observed throughout the entire cranio-caudal extent of the medulla. above the obex, TH-IR cells are abundant and strongly reactive, whereas in the close medulla, i.e. At the level of the pyramidal decussation, few TH-IR neurons are detected. Ventrolaterally situated TH-IR neurons are predominantly bipolar in shape . TH-IR neurons in the dorsomedial medulla are concentrated in 4 groups : one being located ventrolateral to and inside the dorsal vagal nucleus (area C in ), a second one located dorsal to and within the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (area B in ; ), which is caudally also related to the dorsal column nuclei, a third one located within the area postrema (area A in ; ), and a fourth group lying adjacent to and overlapping with the commissural nucleus of the vagus . In the last group, TH-IR neurons are fewer and more weakly stained than in the first three groups. The dorsomedial TH-IR neurons do not show any predominant orientation. At 21 weeks, TH-IR neurons are observed in essentially the same location as at younger stages . In the ventrolateral TH-IR cell cluster, neurons are again located in the vicinity of the lateral reticular nucleus and the nucleus ambiguus (area C in ). TH-IR neurons located in the dorsomedial medulla have matured in a similar way . TH-IR neurons associated with the nucleus solitarius (area B in ) are located on its lateral and dorsal margins; the dorsally located cells are found adjacent to the ventricular surface and extend towards the dorsal vagal nucleus. TH-IR neurons situated in the vicinity of the dorsal vagal nucleus (area C in ) and the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (area B in ) are mainly bipolar in shape without any preferential orientation . However, distinct TH-IR fiber tracts cannot yet be distinguished. As at earlier ages, densely packed TH-IR neurons are observed within the area postrema, often lying close to blood vessels (area A in ). At 25 weeks, TH-IR neurons have become even more dispersed, but still occupy essentially the same location as at younger ages . The close association of TH-IR fibers and blood vessels has become more prominent. In TH-IR neurons situated in the dorsomedial medulla, differentiation has proceeded in a similar manner with multipolar neurons now being the predominant cell type. At this stage, a distinct fiber tract has become visible consisting of numerous TH-IR axons forming a fiber bundle occupying part of the tractus solitarius . Below the obex, in the region of the commissural nucleus of the vagus, TH-IR processes are very delicate, and labeled commissural processes can be detected readily only with dark field illumination . The results show that, already at 14.5 weeks of gestation, TH-IR neurons in the human medulla oblongata occupy essentially the same location as described in the adult . At this early stage, TH-IR neurons are found in the ventrolateral medulla close to the lateral reticular and ambiguus nuclei and in the dorsomedial medulla where they are concentrated in and around the dorsal vagal nucleus, the commissural nucleus of the vagus, the nucleus of the tractus solitarius and the area postrema. These two TH-IR cell columns stretch over almost the entire rostro-caudal extent of the medulla. This finding is in agreement with the mapping of TH-IR in the medulla of human embryos between 4.5 and 6 weeks of gestation showing that, already at the neuromere stade, TH-IR neurons form two elongated longitudinally oriented bands located dorsomedially and ventrolaterally connected by streams of intermediate TH-IR cells. In the dorsomedial cluster, only TH-IR neurons related to the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, area postrema and dorsal column nuclei are observed in the alar plate and therefore classified as A2/C2 group. According to their origin from the basal plate, rename TH-IR neurons situated around the dorsal vagal motor nucleus as an \u201cA1/C1 periventricular group\u201d. In addition, these studies on very young human embryos demonstrate that migration of TH-IR neurons in the medulla mainly occurs along the radial direction from a deep postmitotic position close to the ventricular layer to a more superficial position and that tangential or rostrocaudal migration is minimal. However, we have found scattered intermediate TH-IR cells in the human medulla aged 14.5 weeks and older between the two larger longitudinally oriented cell clusters, which have not been reported by in younger embryos, but which are also seen in the adult human medulla . It may well be that these scattered TH-IR neurons are the result of a lateral neuron migration occurring at later stages. Developmental studies at very early stages also reveal that CA neurons in the human medulla are initially (6 weeks of gestation) only TH-IR, i.e. From 13 weeks onward, they also express DBH-IR and some of them, in addition, PNMT, indicating that TH-IR neurons detected in our study are mainly noradrenergic (A1, A2), with some intermingled adrenergic neurons (C1, C2). Our observation that TH-IR neurons are found within the area postrema differs from the description of the adult human medulla, where these neurons are located underlying the area postrema and rostral to it, but not within it . There are several possible explanations for this difference in location of TH-IR neurons between the developing and the adult area postrema. TH-IR neurons may migrate laterally during subsequent development or may be displaced by later-generated area postrema cells. This possibility seems unlikely in view of the observation by that tangential migration of TH-IR neurons is minimal. But it cannot be completely excluded considering that the appearance of scattered TH-IR neurons indicates that lateral migration may occur at later stages. Our study shows that, at 14.5 weeks of gestation, TH-IR neurons in the human medulla still exhibit a rather immature phenotype. TH-IR fiber tracts have not been detected at this early stage. In the course of subsequent neuronal maturation, TH-IR processes elongate, become increasingly delicate and give off numerous thin branches eventually forming fine fiber networks in and around medullar nuclei or extend long axons, which become part of TH-IR fiber tracts. Only at 25 weeks of gestation, TH-IR neurons have achieved a multipolar morphology and TH-IR fiber tracts appear. In our study, TH-IR neurons have been observed in proximity to blood vessels at 16 weeks in the vicinity of the area postrema and at 21 weeks in the other CA cell groups. Only at 25 weeks of gestation, however, TH-IR neurons show many long fine processes which frequently enter in close contact to blood vessels. Proximity of numerous TH-IR processes to blood vessels has been described in the adult human , but also nonhuman primate , rat and cat medullar reticular formation and has been related to chemoreceptor function . Only at this age, TH-IR neurons exhibit a multipolar, rather mature morphology. A fine TH-IR fiber network has developed and, in addition, distinct TH-IR fiber tracts can be observed. These findings indicate that, in the human medulla, TH-IR neurons, though generated rather early during development, mature relatively late.", "BACE1-IR increased in the CA3 mossy fiber field and dentate inner molecular layer in pilocarpine-induced epileptic mice, relative to controls (saline-treated mice and mice 24\u201348 h after pilocarpine-status), and paralleled aberrant expression of neuropeptide Y. Regionally increased BACE1-IR also occurred in neuropil in hippocampal area CA1 and in subregions of the amygdala and temporal cortex in epileptic mice, colocalizing with increased IR for growth associated protein 43 (GAP43) and polysialylated-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), but reduced IR for microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2).

Here, we applied the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer 2 (BRET2) technique to study the IR signaling pathways. The interaction between the IR and the substrates IRS1, IRS4 and Shc was examined in response to ligands with different signaling properties. The association between IR and the interacting partners could successfully be monitored when co-expressing green fluorescent protein 2 (GFP2) tagged substrates with Renilla reniformis luciferase 8 (Rluc8) tagged IR. Through additional optimization steps, we developed a stable and flexible BRET2 assay for monitoring the interactions between the IR and its substrates. Furthermore, the insulin analogue X10 was characterized in the BRET2 assay and was found to be 10 times more potent with respect to IRS1, IRS4 and Shc recruitment compared to human insulin.

Various The intense inflammatory response to HCV is deemed central to the development of peripheral and hepatic IR in chronic HCV infection, primarily through disruptions in the insulin signaling pathway. Several studies have reported that TNF\u03b1 can directly interfere with insulin signaling in HCV patients ( There is increasing evidence that HCV has direct effects on insulin signaling (Figure Another group demonstrated that mice transgenic for the HCV core protein showed decreased expression of IRS-1 and IRS-2 ( These findings were replicated in another Histological evaluation of the pancreases of HCV-seropositive patients has shown evidence for pancreatic \u03b2-cells that are infected with HCV.

Moreover, there is negative impact of IR and diabetes on virological response and long-term outcomes of HCV infection. Permanent insulin treatment has been required in most cases of IFN-induced T1D ( Metformin was not reported to cause hepatotoxicity and therefore should be considered as the drug of choice in HCV patients with IR or T2D.

The consequences of oxidative stress and chronic inflammation involve the activation of multiple serine kinase cascades () some of which target the insulin signaling pathway by phosphorylation of specific serine/threonine residues of IRS1and IRS2 (). Furthermore, it has been shown that the major stress response kinases, p38MAPK, IKK\u03b2, NF\u03baB and ERK that are induced by dysfunctional mitochondrial-generated ROS and inflammation, inhibit insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation as well as its interaction with PI3K resulting in a decrease of the downstream signaling activities and eventually attenuation of insulin action (). We propose that the pathway of development of T2D and insulin resistance in response to mitochondrial generated ROS involves the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of certain serine residues of the insulin signaling pathway, , IRS-1, AKT (PKB) and GSK3\u03b2, and that treatment with antioxidants would protect against oxidative stress-mediated inhibition of the pathway (). Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with antibodies against phosphorylated AKT (Ser) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), phosphorylated GSK3\u03b2 (Ser) (Cell Signaling Technology), phosphorylated IRS1 (Ser) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), phosphorylated p38MAPK (Thr/Tyr) (Cell Signaling Technology), and phosphorylated MKK3/6 (Ser) (Cell Signaling Technology), or antibodies against total AKT(Cell Signaling Technology), total GSK3\u03b2 (Cell Signaling Technology), total IRS1(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), total p38MAPK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and total MKK3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Primary mouse hepatocytes were treated with 20 \u03bcM ROT for 30 min, or with 100 nM insulin for 5 min, to establish the effect of ROT and insulin on the insulin signaling proteins, i.e., AKT, GSK3\u03b2, and IRS-1 (). One of the regulatory processes at the proximal end of insulin signaling involves the phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser. The critical function of this Ser residue for IRS-1 is associated with its proximity to the phosphotyrosine binding domain (PTB) of IRS-1, at which site it binds to the phosphotyrosines in the IR tyrosine kinase domain (). Therefore, phosphorylation of Ser results in inhibition of PTB binding to the IR leading to inhibition of signal transduction from the insulin receptor to its downstream effectors. We therefore examined the effect of ROT or insulin treatment on IRS-1 Ser phosphorylation as a possible mechanism of insulin resistance at the proximal end of the pathway. ROT treatment of primary hepatocytes resulted in a significant increase in Ser phosphorylation of IRS-1, while insulin did not participate in this inhibitory step (EF). Pretreatment with ROT prior to the insulin challenge also resulted in a significant increase in IRS-1 Ser phosphorylation. Our results show that ROT stimulates the phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser even in the presence of insulin, thus suggesting that this specific phosphorylation is the molecular mechanism that links oxidative stress and insulin resistance and involves inhibition of the proximal end of the insulin signaling pathway. These results suggest that the resistance of the insulin signaling pathway due to mitochondrial generated oxidative stress involves the phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser. ROT treatment resulted in Ser phosphorylation of IRS-1 which was decreased significantly with NAC pretreatment (AB). Our data show that pretreatment with NAC neutralized the hepatocytic response to ROS produced by ROT-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, and since this inhibited the Ser phosphorylation of IRS-1, we propose that ROT-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser is part of the mechanism of hepatic insulin resistance. To investigate the involvement of p38MAPK in the ROT-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser, cells were treated with 20 \u03bcM SB203580 or with 20 \u03bcM SB202190 for 30 min prior to their ROT or ROT-insulin treatments, in the continued presence of the inhibitor (A\u2013D). Pretreatment with SB203580 inhibited the ROT-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser in the absence of insulin (AB), as well as in the presence of insulin (CD). This indicates that the ROT-induced IRS-1 Ser phosphorylation is mediated through the activation of p38MAPK. The inhibitory effect of two independent p38MAPK inhibitors strongly suggests the involvement of p38MAPK in the ROT-induced phosphorylation of IRS1 Ser. Our studies provide further indication of a crosstalk mechanism between oxidative stress and the insulin signaling pathway by demonstrating a role of the ROS-p38MAPK-mediated phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of IRS-1, AKT and GSK3\u03b2, affecting their signaling functions. We thus conclude that ROT-mediated inhibition of the metabolic functions at the distal end of IRS-1 insulin signaling plays a key role in insulin resistance. For example, the inhibition by ROT at the distal end of the insulin signaling may be a consequence of inhibition on the proximal end as indicated by ROT-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser, which interferes with its tyrosine phosphorylation by IR thereby resulting in its inactivation (). Previous studies focused on prolonged exposure to insulin which resulted in p38MAPK activation and IRS1/2 degradation resulting in insulin resistance (). Other studies found that, only under insulin-stimulated conditions, prolonged exposure to oxidant stress resulted in loss of IRS1 protein (). Our studies, on the other hand, focused on the early response of IRS1 towards Rotenone treatment, and we did not investigate further if the IRS-1 Ser phosphorylation would trigger its degradation by the proteosome at later time periods. However, the phosphorylation of p38MAPK and of IRS-1 Ser occurred in parallel suggesting that p38MAPK may be the mediator of ROT-induced inhibition of the insulin signaling. Further support for this hypothesis stems from the fact that inhibition of p38MAPK phosphorylation by NAC or the inhibition of its kinase activity by SB203580 and SB202190 resulted in inhibition of IRS-1 Ser phosphorylation (). The observation that the antioxidant NAC inhibits the ROT-induced IRS-1 Ser phosphorylation and inactivation supports our proposal that insulin resistance may be alleviated by decreasing or inhibiting both endogenous ROS production as well as exposure to exogenous/environmental generators of ROS. The use of either inhibitor reduced the ROT-induced phosphorylation of IRS1 Ser suggesting that the ROT-induced phosphorylation and inactivation of IRS1 is mediated through p38MAPK. These results suggest that the ROT-mediated inactivation of the insulin signaling via the stimulation of IRS-1 Ser phosphorylation, as well as the inactivation of AKT, are not linked. Thus, we propose that the ROT-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 is mediated through activation of the p38MAPK stress-response pathway, while the ROT-induced inactivation of AKT involves a different mechanism that is not mediated by p38MAPK. We have presented evidence that the ROT-induced generation of ROS inactivates IRS-1 through its Ser phosphorylation and leads to insulin resistance in hepatocytes. Our results indicate that ROT may impair insulin signaling by more than one mechanism: a) IRS-1 Ser phosphorylation and inactivation in a p38MAPK-dependent manner, and b) inhibition of AKT Ser phosphorylation and activation in a p38MAPK-independent manner. In the present study, we have shown that oxidative stress generated by ROT inhibits both basal and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of specific Ser residues in AKT and GSK3\u03b2; and stimulates the phosphorylation of a specific Ser residue in IRS-1. Our hypothesis is supported by the demonstration that rotenone-generated ROS by ETC-CI activates the p38MAPK mediated phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser which is a modification associated with impaired insulin signaling and insulin resistance.", "This study demonstrates that IR triggers Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission and that Drp1 inhibition attenuates radiation-induced mitotic catastrophe, suggesting that Drp1 is involved in determining the fate of cells after irradiation. In this study, we provide evidence that IR triggers mitochondrial fission mediated by the mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). We also show IR-induced mitotic catastrophe (MC), which is a type of cell death associated with defective mitosis, and aberrant centrosome amplification in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). As shown in IR triggers mitochondrial fission.

Anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a ubiquitin ligase that initiates the metaphase\u2013anaphase transition and mitotic exit by targeting proteins such as securin and cyclin B1 ( In addition to the reduced mitochondrial fission, we found the following effects of Drp1 inhibition on cellular radioresponses: 1) Drp1 inhibition prevented the induction of aberrant centrosome amplification and MC; 2) aberrant centrosome amplification and MC in Drp1-deficient cells were insensitive to the inhibition of Plk1 and CDK2; and 3) Drp1 deficiency resulted in the accumulation of cyclin B1 after IR. Because DSB level, evaluated by \u03b3-H2AX, was not influenced by Drp1 inhibition ( In summary, the present study demonstrates that IR triggers Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission and that Drp1 inhibition attenuates radiation-induced MC, suggesting that Drp1 is involved in determining the fate of cells after irradiation by controlling mitochondrial shape.", "APPswe/PS1\u0394E9 begin accumulating general A\u03b2 around 4-6 months of age in the cortex and hippocampus ( In hippocampus, R1282 IR was reduced by 35% in 500\u03bcg 07/1-immunized Tg mice (p<0.05), 45% in 150\u03bcg 07/1-immunized Tg mice (p<0.01) and 58% in 3A1-immunized Tg mice (p<0.001) compared to PBS-treated Tg mice ( In parallel to significant plaque reduction in hippocampus, similar results were also observed in both the frontal cortex and cerebellum. In frontal cortex, general A\u03b2 IR was reduced 20% (p<0.05) in 150\u03bcg 07/1-immunized and 25% (p<0.01) in 500\u03bcg 07/1-immunized Tg mice and 44% (p<0.001) in 3A1-immunized Tg mice compared to PBS-treated Tg controls ( In the cerebellum, the greatest reductions were observed in general A\u03b2 and A\u03b21-x IR in which 150\u03bcg 07/1-immunized and 500\u03bcg 07/1-immunized Tg mice had reductions of 27% (p<0.05) and 43% (p<0.001) in general A\u03b2 deposition and 52% (p<0.01) and 36% (n.s.) of A\u03b2(1-x) IR, respectively ( To examine for changes in vascular amyloid, quantitative image analysis was performed on Thioflavin S-positive blood vessels in the cerebellum. IgG1 IR was detected in 500\u03bcg (S2H) and 150\u03bcg 07/1 immunized mice (S2G) which colocalized with a subset of R1282 (S2C,D) and 07/2-immunreactive plaques (S2K,L). Intense IgG1 IR was observed in 3A1-immunized mice (S2F) that colocalized with near all general A\u03b2 deposition (S2B) and a subset of pGlu-3 A\u03b2 plaques (S2J). Representative photomicrographs from one mouse per group show that both Iba1 and CD68-positive microglia colocalized with general A\u03b2 in all groups, however, overall there were no changes in Iba1 IR microglia between immunized (E,H,K) and PBS-treated Tg mice (B). Quantitative image analysis of six immunolabeled section, at three equidistant planes, of Iba1 IR in the entire hippocampus confirmed there were no changes in Iba1-positive microglia between groups (M).", "IR associated with MS, NAFLD, and type 2 diabetes mellitus lead to the release of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, leptin and resistin, as well as decreased amounts of adiponectin.", "Therefore, pHBSP can significantly protect against obesity and IR partly by inhibiting adipogenesis and inflammation. As shown in Because a series of IR-related, pro-inflammatory adipokines are synthesized during adipocyte maturation, we further investigated the effects of pHBSP on the expression levels of select adipokines in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and found that pHBSP dose-dependently down-regulated the mRNA levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and MCP-1 in MDI-induced 3T3-L1 preadipocytes ( To determine whether pHBSP functions through TPR signaling in adipocytes, a reported EPOR antagonist, EPO mimetic peptide-9 (EMP9), was used Subsequently, we tested the effects of pHBSP on the inflammatory activation of macrophages. We found that co-treatment with pHBSP increased the expression of Fizz-1, Arginase-1 and PPAR\u03b3 compared to treatment with IL-4 alone ( Due to the potent anti-adipogenic and anti-inflammatory effects of pHBSP Because fat mass gain is closely related to fatty acid oxidation, we examined the effects of pHBSP on fatty acid synthase gene (FASN) expression in WAT and Acox-1 expression in muscle and found that pHBSP decreased FASN ( Because IR is an essential event towards metabolic dysregulation in obesity, we tested the levels of glucose and insulin tolerance following pHBSP treatment in DIO mice. Administration of pHBSP to HFD-fed mice every other day for 16 weeks did not alter spleen weight ( Given the important contribution of local inflammation to the development of IR in adipose tissue, we next examined the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in epididymal WAT of HFD-fed mice and found that levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, iNOS and MCP-1 were greatly reduced following pHBSP treatment for 16 weeks ( Because macrophages play dominant roles in obesity-associated inflammation, we next examined whether pHBSP affected ATMs in HFD-fed mice. First, we found that pHBSP treatment dramatically reduced the accumulation of F4/80 Growing attention has focused on the nonerythropoietic activity of EPO, such as its role in obesity regulation Obesity is associated with hyperplasia and hypertrophy of adipocytes in white adipose tissue, the main site for excess energy storage Obesity increases the risk for T2D by inducing IR. Although the manner in which obesity influences IR is not fully known, over the past several years, the significant contributions of pro-inflammatory molecules, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, iNOS and MCP-1, to IR have been elucidated Mechanistically, our study revealed that pHBSP significantly inhibited PPAR\u03b3 expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. It has been reported that EPO activates ERK, which further increased PPAR\u03b3 phosphorylation and decreased PPAR\u03b3 activity in 3T3-L1 cells In summary, the protective role of pHBSP in obesity and IR was established in the current study. pHBSP may be a promising candidate for DIO intervention, improving IR and attenuating inflammation through multiple mechanisms.", "Previously, we showed that the Vif-derived peptide (Vif25-39) efficiently inhibits A3G deamination, and increases sensitivity of lymphoma cells to IR. Cells use an intricate set of mechanisms to repair genomic DSBs, based on non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) [ Several types of cancer cells, such as lymphoma and myeloma cells, e.g., Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), display efficient repair of genomic DSBs induced by IR or chemotherapies, and enhanced cell survival after these treatments [ Thus, inhibition of A3G activity could potentially restrain the progressive accumulation of mutations, which is one of the underlying processes that characterizes the cancer phenotype [ Our current study focuses on inhibiting A3G catalytic activity using variety of peptides to improve the outcome of genotoxic lymphoma therapies. In the active peptides, several sequence motifs were implicated in efficient inhibition of A3G deaminase activity Treatment of IR-resistant lymphoma cells with either of these peptides [ By screening Vif domains responsible for inhibition of A3G deamination, we identified Vif25-39 and Vif105-119 as efficient inhibitors ( Based on this information novel peptides derived from Vif and A3F including the LYYF or VKHH were synthesized and assessed as A3G inhibitors ( To evaluate the contribution of each residue in the Vif 107-115, we synthesized peptides in which two residues from the N\u2019 terminus was removed (Vif 109-115) and peptides in which the The VKHH sequence is another motif common to Vif and A3F ( In summary, the six amino acid comprise the N\u2019 terminus of the Vif107-115 are essential for A3G inhibition, while each of the 15 residues of the Vif25-39 contribute to the efficiency of inhibition. Similar to Vif25-39; Vif107-115, A3F305-311 and A3F304-312 inhibit DSB repair as the average number of \u03b3-H2AX foci per cell were 3.7, 2.2 and 3.2, respectively ( The inhibitory effect of DSB repair by Vif- and A3F-derived peptides is not limited to H9 lymphoma cells, which express high amounts of A3G since the same peptides impede DSB repair in Ly-4 lymphoma cells in a similar manner ( We used the comet assay ( To define whether the peptides, which inhibit purified A3G Exposure of cultured Ly-4 cells to IR (4 Gy) decreases their propagation.

The aortic IR group underwent clamping of the infrarenal abdominal aorta for 30 min followed by 60 min of reperfusion. The aortic IR + erythropoietin group underwent the same aortic IR periods and was pretreated with 1000 U/kg subcutaneous erythropoietin 5 min before ischemia. Aortic IR significantly increased the levels of MDA and superoxide dismutase (P < 0.05 versus control). Erythropoietin significantly decreased the levels of MDA, superoxide dismutase, and catalase (P < 0.05 versus aortic IR). Histological evaluation showed that aortic IR significantly increased (P < 0.05 versus control), whereas erythropoietin significantly decreased (P < 0.05 versus aortic IR) the focal glomerular necrosis, dilation of Bowman's capsule, degeneration of tubular epithelium, necrosis in tubular epithelium, interstitial inflammatory infiltration, and congestion of blood vessels. The results indicate that erythropoietin has protective effects on renal injury induced by aortic IR in rats.", "The animal models of IR, T2DM, and T2DM treated with 1-alpha hydroxyvitamin D (1-alphaOHD) were established on 18-month-old male Wistar rats.

Urinary albumin level in the rats with T2DM significantly increased, and there existed a significant and negative correlation between GIR and UA level in the rats with T2DM or IR. The levels of serum 1,25-OH2D and BMD in the rats with IR were significantly higher than those in the rats with T2DM and were lower than those in normal control rats. There existed a negative correlation between the levels of serum 1,25-(OH)2D and UA in the rats with T2DM or IR. In IR or T2DM, abnormal vitamin D metabolism is characterized by 1,25-OH2D deficiency and is related to renal injury, and there also existed bone loss.", "", "III and IV, IR groups (n = 11/group): Animals were subjected to ischemia and reperfusion of the LLL.

Insulin injection led to a rapid and dose-dependent increase in Grb14 content, first in the plasma membrane fraction, and then in the Golgi/endosome fraction, which paralleled the increase in IR beta-subunit tyrosine phosphorylation. Upon sustained in vivo IR tyrosine phosphorylation induced by high-affinity insulin analogs, in vitro IR dephosphorylation by endogenous phosphatases, and in vivo phosphorylation of the IR induced by injection of bisperoxo(1,10 phenanthroline)oxovanadate, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, we observed a striking correlation between IR phosphorylation state and Grb14 content in both the plasma membrane and Golgi/endosome fractions. In addition, coimmunoprecipitation experiments provided evidence that Grb14 was associated with phosphorylated IR beta-subunit in these fractions. Altogether, these data support a model whereby insulin stimulates the recruitment of endogenous Grb14 to the activated IR at the plasma membrane, and induces internalization of the Grb14-IR complex in endosomes. Removal of Grb14 from fractions of insulin-treated rats by KCl treatment led to an increase of in vivo insulin-stimulated IR tyrosine kinase activity, indicating that endogenous Grb14 exerts a negative feedback control on IR catalytic activity.", "Impaired Akt activation in insulin-sensitive tissues contributes to IR. These data suggest that DM2 is associated with selective IR in the kidney, allowing pro-growth signaling via mTOR, whereas potentially protective effects mediated by eNOS are blunted.", "Adult male 8-week-old IR mice (C57BL/6J, ob/ob) and lean (Lean) littermates were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN, USA). The ob/ob mice lack functional leptin and become obese and IR. The impact of IR on the degree of brain injury after experimental strokes without associated diabetes has not been previously described. Our novel finding is that MCAO leads to both quantitative and qualitative differences between IR and non-IR mice. First, infarct area in was enhanced in the IR mice. Although the reason for this difference is unclear, we believe that the predominant effect of short-term RSV was to reverse the underlying cerebral vascular inflammation associated with IR and that longer treatment periods are necessary for the additional beneficial effects, which were observed previously in healthy rodents. Vascular inflammation is a common feature of IR ( Insulin resistance especially in obese individuals leads to enhanced incidence of stroke as well as increased morbidity and mortality after stroke. The underlying basis for the greater vulnerability in people with the metabolic syndrome and in experimental animals with IR, obesity, and/or diabetes is not fully understood. Nonetheless, our findings provide evidence that statin therapies can provide a rapid and sustained protection of the neurovascular unit in patients experiencing IR.

In CHC, IR develops early in the course of the disease and precedes steatosis. Consequently, therapies targeting IR and metabolic syndrome could indirectly ameliorate the prognosis of both NAFLD and CHC.", "Fasting serum insulin and glucose were measured at baseline and again after a 3-year of follow-up; IR was defined according to optimal cut-off values. Multiple logistic regression models were used to estimate the risk of IR according to the PRAL and NEAP quartile categories. Mean age and body mass index of the participants were 40.3 years old of 26.4 kg/m The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing worldwide ( Dietary intake has an important influence in human metabolic acidosis ( Regarding the limited data available on the association between dietary acid load and IR risk, in the present study, we assessed the relationship between 2 scores of dietary acid load on IR risk in Tehranian adults. Participants were excluded if they were diagnosed as under-reporters (\u2264800 kcal/d) or over-reporters (>4,200 kcal/d) (n=35) of dietary intake or were on specific diets, or lacked follow up information on biochemical and anthropometrics measurements at the second examination (2009~2011) (n=24); we also excluded subjects who had IR at baseline (n=157): the final sample for analyses included 925 adults. Low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c) was measured from the serum HDL-c, TC, and TG concentrations expressed in mg/dL, using the Friedewald formula ( Dietary intake was collected at baseline (2006~2008), using a reliable, validated 168-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) ( The dietary acid load score was characterized by 2 measures: PRAL and NEAP; the PRAL score was calculated based on several nutrient intakes using the following algorithm ( PRAL was adjusted for total energy intake, based on the residuals method to control for total energy intake ( The risk of IR was estimated across quartiles of PRAL and also quartiles of NEAP, using multiple regression models, and presented in different models. Mean (SD) age and BMI of participants were 40.3 (12.1) years and 26.4 (4.4) kg/m Mean dietary intakes of the participants across quartiles of PRAL are reported in Associations of dietary PRAL and NEAP with IR are shown in The results of this longitudinal study provide further evidence regarding the possible association of dietary acid base load with the risk of IR. In this study PRAL and NEAP were positively correlated to IR risk. In agreement with previous studies, we observed that participants in the high PRAL score had higher intakes of meat and grains but had lower intakes of fruits, vegetables ( Although in a cross sectional study of an apparently healthy Japanese population, PRAL and NEAP were positively associated with IR ( In contrast to our results, in a cross-sectional study of 1,125 young women, a positive association was observed for IR with PRAL but not with NEAP ( In a cross-sectional study of healthy adults, markers of metabolic acidosis, including the anion gap was found to have an inverse association with fasting insulin levels, while bi-carbonate had a positive association with fasting insulin levels ( Several possible mechanisms have been suggested for a relationship between dietary acid load and IR risk. We found that both PRAL and NEAP were positively associated with the risk of IR in this Tehranian population. We recommend that more studies should be conducted to clarify the effect of dietary acid load on IR.

Experiments were performed ex vivo with human blood and in a liver IR model with wild-type, Adora2a, and Adora2b mice. During liver IR, sevoflurane (2 Vol%) decreased PNC formation 2.4-fold in wild-type (P < 0.05) but not in Adora2b mice (n \u2265 5). Our experiments highlight antiinflammatory and tissue-protective properties of sevoflurane during liver IR and reveal a mechanistic role of Adora2b in sevoflurane-associated effects. The targeted use of sevoflurane not only as an anesthetic but also to prevent IR damage is a promising approach in the treatment of critically ill patients.", "We evaluated whether dapagliflozin reduces renal damage in IR mice model. Dapagliflozin reduced renal expression of Bax, renal tubule injury and TUNEL-positive cells and increased renal expression of HIF1 in IR-injured mice. HIF1 inhibition by albendazole negated the renoprotective effects of dapagliflozin treatment in IR-injured mice. In conclusion, dapagliflozin attenuates renal IR injury. HIF1 induction by dapagliflozin may play a role in renoprotection against renal IR injury. The mice were divided into five groups: vehicle (Vh)-treated sham (n = 5), dapagliflozin-treated sham (n = 5), Vh-treated IR (n = 7), dapagliflozin-treated IR (n = 7), and albendazole and dapagliflozin treated IR (n = 7).

We generated and phenotyped a new adipose tissue-specific IR mouse model using the adipose tissue-specific Adipoq-Cre line. Here we show that the Adipoq-Cre-mediated IR KO in mice leads to lipodystrophy and metabolic dysfunction, which is in stark contrast to the previous study. Lipodystrophic IR KO mice have profound insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, organomegaly, and impaired adipokine secretion. Adipoq-Cre-mediated IR KO leads to lipodystrophy in mice. IR KO differentially affects white, brown and marrow fat development and metabolism. IR KO affects marrow adipocytes lipid accumulation but not development. The mouse adipocyte protein 2 promoter-driven Cre line (aP2-Cre) has been used to examine the \u2018adipose-specific\u2019 functions of IR in transgenic mice Adipoq-Cre and IR Plasma insulin was measured with an ELISA kit (RayBiotech). and were analyzed by unpaired two-tailed Student's To confirm the deletion of IR in adipose tissue, we quantified mRNA expression for IR in BAT, inguinal subcutaneous fat (iWAT), liver, hypothalamus, and heart. As expected, IR mRNA was dramatically reduced in both BAT and iWAT, but not in liver, hypothalamus, heart, and stromal-vascular-fraction (SVF) cells isolated from BAT and iWAT, confirming the specificity of Adipoq-Cre-mediated deletion ( Unlike previous studies on the fat-specific insulin receptor KO using aP2-Cre mice Histological analysis of the small amount of iWAT present in IR To characterize the potential requirement for IR in development and/or metabolism of marrow adipocytes, we stained whole tibiae from WT and IR Due to loss of needed fat storage organs, lipodystrophy is often associated with organomegaly, particularly hepatomegaly Lipodystrophy in either human or mouse models is associated with severe metabolic disturbances, including hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia In addition to ectopic lipid accumulation, we also observed significant increases in circulating triglyceride, free fatty acid, and cholesterol levels in both male and female IR Brown adipocytes have different developmental origins than white adipocytes Our current study confirms the pivotal roles of insulin signaling in adipocyte development and function. We observed that adipocyte-specific ablation of IR leads to near-complete lipodystrophy, severe insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and related metabolic disturbances in both male and female mice. This finding is strikingly different from the previously generated FIRKO mice that are protected from age-induced obesity and associated glucose metabolism dysfunction The severe metabolic syndrome (i.e. insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hepatosteatosis) observed in IR Based on the differentiation markers results ( Adipose tissue is the major producer of the hormones adiponectin and leptin The role of IR in development and metabolism of MAT has not been evaluated previously. Quantification by \u03bcCT of osmium tetroxide-stained lipid in the tibia of IR Under homeostatic conditions, insulin suppresses gluconeogenesis and activates lipogenesis in the liver. However, in the IR One of the main functional differences between white and brown fat is the thermogenic capacity of brown adipocytes via the highly expressed mitochondrial UCP1. We showed that UCP1 expression in brown adipocytes is dependent on insulin signaling, which was clearly demonstrated by the dramatically reduced UCP1 expression in neonatal IR The roles of insulin signaling in lipogenesis and glycolysis in adipocytes are clearly demonstrated in the IR It was surprising to learn that in the previous fat-specific IR KO, Glut1 but not Glut4 was affected in adipose tissue.

UPR is mediated by the activation of three ER proteins: protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol requiring enzyme 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1) and activating transcription factor-6 (ATF-6) () (). When the ER is under stress, UPR proteins are liberated from BiP to be activated, PERK and IRE1\u03b1 are -autophosphorylated while ATF-6 translocates to the Golgi complex (). While, activation of IRE1\u03b1 results in the splicing of X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1) mRNA and spliced XBP-1 induces the transcription of molecular chaperones and genes involved in ER biogenesis, phospholipid synthesis and ERAD. Moreover, IRE1\u03b1 pathway was shown to regulate the transcription of several genes involved in fatty acid and triacylglyceride synthesis (). The IRE1\u03b1-XBP-1 pathway in hepatic lipid homeostasis in ER stress conditions has also been studied. Hepatocyte specific IRE1\u03b1 knockout mice improved severe hepatic steatosis following treatment of an ER stress inducer, due to the repressed expression of key metabolic transcriptional regulators, such as C/EBP\u03b2, C/EBP\u03b4, and PPAR\u03b3, and enzymes associated with triglyceride biosynthesis (). IRE1\u03b1 is also reported to be responsible for the effective apolipoprotein excretion upon disturbance of ER homeostasis (). Thus, the IRE1\u03b1-XBP-1 pathway plays an essential role in the regulation of hepatic VLDL collection and secretion (). As a result, UPR arms involving PERK, IRE1\u03b1, and ATF-6\u03b1 can modulate lipid depositions in the hepatocytes (). During the inflammatory process, ER stress is triggered and IRE1\u03b1 connected to TNF\u03b1 receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) (). IRE1\u03b1 links ER stress and inflammation since pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are synthesized by NF-\u03baB and JNK, are activated via the IRE1\u03b1-TRAF2 complex (). p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular-regulated kinase are also induced by IRE1\u03b1 activation (). In this direction, IRE1\u03b1 both regulates the adaptation to ER stress and the activation of signaling pathways (). The complex of IRE1\u03b1-TRAF2 is essential for either JNK or NF-\u03baB activity, may be also related to NAFLD pathogenesis (). In addition, recent evidence has also highlighted the IRE1\u03b1-XBP-1 pathway in the regulation of antioxidant defenses (). Furthermore, miR-33a/b is related to lipid and glucose homeostasis by affecting NAD+ dependent sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), which in turn promotes the expression of SREBP target genes (). Moreover, it has been shown that SIRT1 is further inhibited by another miRNA, miR-34a (). Next, by computational experiments miR-199a/b-5p was found to be a potential candidate, which could regulate GRP78, ATF-6\u03b1 and IRE1\u03b1. In addition, inhibition of miR-199a-5p resulted in increased ER stress-induced apoptosis; which can be partially abrogated by silencing IRE1\u03b1 suggests that IRE1\u03b1 signaling under these conditions is proapoptotic.", "In a mouse model of IR injury, intravenous PLGA nanoparticles distribute to the IR myocardium and monocytes in the blood and in the IR heart. We show that PLGA nanoparticles deliver the drug to the mononuclear phagocytic system and IR myocardium after intravenous injection at the time of reperfusion. We also demonstrate that irbesartan-NP limits IR injury by antagonizing the recruitment of Ly6C We induced IR injury in C57BL/6 mice and analyzed single-cell suspensions of digested IR heart at different time points ( To determine the role of neutrophils- or Ly6C Because Ly6C To investigate the biodistribution of PLGA-NP, we injected indocyanine green-incorporated nanoparticles (ICG-NP) in mice and traced with PLGA-NP-mediated delivery of irbesartan to monocytes and IR myocardium may enhance anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective effects of irbesartan for IR injury. Indeed, intravenous treatment with irbesartan-NP at the time of reperfusion (containing 3.0 mg kg We also performed To explore the role of AT1R in cardioprotection, we examined the myocardial infarct size in WT and AT1aR-deficient mice and observed that the infarct size was equivalent between the WT and AT1aR-deficient mice 24 hours after IR ( We tested the chemotactic activity of treated THP-1 monocytes in response to MCP-1 by chemotaxis assay. Irbesartan-NP inhibited MCP-1-induced chemotaxis in a dose-dependent manner ( The novel findings of the present study are as follows; 1) Ly6C Myocardial IR initiates several molecular mechanisms such as a production of reactive oxygen species, a calcium overload, and a pH correction, which lead to mitochondrial injury and myocardial hypercontracture Leukocytes, especially neutrophils and monocytes, are recruited to the areas of injury immediately after ischemia Recent reports suggest that the recruitment of Ly6C FITC-loaded PLGA nanoparticles were incorporated in circulating neutrophils and monocytes and delivered preferentially into ischemic myocardium ( To translate this nanotechnology-based DDS into clinical medicine, we developed PLGA nanoparticles loaded with irbesartan, an ARB with partial PPAR\u03b3 agonistic activity, to regulate inflammation after myocardial IR. Although PLGA nanoparticles clearly increase irbesartan concentration in the ischemic myocardium and the spleen, and enhanced therapeutic efficacy of irbesartan, this composition of nanoparticle may compromise the specificity of delivery and the retardation of drug release, potential advantages of PLGA nanoparticle as a drug carrier In this study, Irbesartan-NP did not reduce cytochrome c leakage from mitochondria to the cytosol 60 minutes after IR, which was reduced by a pretreatment with cyclosporine A that binds to cyclophilin D, a critical component of MPTP ( The infarct-limiting effect of irbesartan-NP was abrogated by the pretreatment with a PPAR\u03b3 antagonist GW9662 ( A previous study There are limitations in the present study. First, mice are not a suitable system to assess microvascular dysfunction or the \u2018no-reflow phenomenon\u2019 during IR injury, which may alter reperfusion itself as well as infarct size in large animal models and humans In conclusion, this study identified inflammatory monocytes as an essential therapeutic target in myocardial IR injury, and demonstrated the feasibility of PLGA nanoparticle-mediated DDS for the treatment of myocardial IR injury, and the proof-of-concept results of irbesartan-NP in a murine model of myocardial IR injury. Homogenates of IR myocardium were analyzed with immunoblotting.", "TPM attenuated seizure-induced neuronal cell death and reduced KA-induced p-Erk IR in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, but did not affect p-Jnk and p-P38. In addition, TPM reduced caspase-3 IR and activation by KA.", "To reduce pulmonary graft dysfunction and improve prognosis after lung transplantation, prevention of IR-induced lung injury in the peri-operative period is required. In the present study, we investigated the effects of recombinant hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) on pulmonary IR injury using a murine model system. To assess the protective effect of HGF against lung injury, mice with pulmonary IR were divided into two groups and injected with 500 microg/kg of human recombinant HGF or the same dose of saline alone as a control. After pulmonary IR injury, the lung injury score increased in a time-dependent manner up to 24 hours. Significantly increased expression of Bcl-xL was observed after IR in mice administered HGF as compared with saline-treated controls. Our findings indicate that administration of exogenous HGF ameliorates the pulmonary tissue injury induced by IR, which may provide an alternative for prevention of IR-induced lung injury in the peri-operative period in lung transplantation.", "The microarray analysis revealed a set of IR responsive genes, including 906 genes at 4 hours and 789 genes at 24 hours after exposure to 5 Gy IR. The processes of cell cycles, apoptosis, signal transduction, and DNA repair involved a high percentage of IR responsive genes, among which, caspase-4 was most strongly induced by irradiation. Consistent with this, downregulation of caspase-4 expression by antisense oligonucleotides significantly increased cell viability and protected cells from undergoing apoptosis induced by IR.", "The objectives of this study were to assess the distribution of p62-immunoreactivity in MND and to determine whether or not the expression of coll XVII is altered in association with the p62-IR lesions. p62-IR pathological lesions were seen in all 9 subjects, though the anatomical distribution varied. However, in the motor cortex, at the level of the medulla in the nucleus hypoglossus, and in the spinal cord, p62-IR NCIs or NTs were seen in all cases. Likewise, TDP-43-IR pathological lesions were seen in all cases in these regions, though in cases 3 and 5, p62-IHC visualized the motor cortex lesions more clearly. Notably, p62-IR NCIs were seen in the frontal cortex, in the hippocampus (both the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus and CA4 region), and in the cerebellum only in the subjects with clinical history of psychiatric morbidity (for clinical diagnoses see ). In line with this, we have shown that the intensity of coll XVII-IR varies in neurons of the normal human brain and that irreversible ischemic damage totally depletes coll XVII-IR (). Also, similarly to , we found that in some subjects p62-IR was much more conspicuous than TDP-43-IR. For reliable assessment of changes seen in corticospinal tracts, CD68-IR macrophages were visualized. \u03b1-synuclein-, \u03b2-amyloid- and TDP-43-IR was assessed as being either present or absent. Each subject was given an Alzheimer's disease-related Braak stage based on hyperphosphorylated tau-IR (). p62-IR NCIs and NTs and coll XVII-IR cytoplasm were noted as either present or absent.", "We have carried out an amino acid residue conservation analysis in order to reconstruct the phylogeny of the IR Family. We have confirmed the location of ligand binding site 1 of the IGF1R and IR. Importantly, we have also predicted the likely location of the insulin binding site 2 on the surface of the fibronectin type III domains of the IR. We suggest a possible mechanical trigger of the activation of the IR that involves a slight \u2018twist\u2019 rotation of the last two fibronectin type III domains in order to face the likely location of insulin. Finally, a strong selective pressure was found amongst the IRR orthologous sequences, suggesting that this orphan receptor has a yet unknown physiological role which may be conserved from amphibians to mammals. Whilst the former is the primary regulator of carbohydrate homeostasis and has effects on lipid and protein metabolism The IR and IGF1R, along with the IR-Related Receptor (IRR) The IR is expressed in two isoforms IR-A (exon 11\u2212) and IR-B (exon 11+) Although no ligand has yet been associated to the IRR, its expression in a variety of tissues including kidney, heart, liver and pancreas has been reported IR family members are synthesised as single-chain pre-proreceptors, which are then glycosylated, folded, dimerised and processed to produce the mature \u03b1 The structural determination of the first three domains of the IGF1R was reported in 1998 Attempts to obtain insights into the ectodomain arrangement and ligand binding of the IR have included a three-dimensional reconstruction based on images obtained by electron cryomicroscopy A crystal structure of only the first three domains of the IR was also recently obtained, and a possible model of insulin binding to the L1 domain was proposed Recently, studies involving the construction of chimeric receptors have shown that there is a significant contribution of L2 and particularly of FnIII-1 to insulin binding Biological evolution has recorded vast and highly precise information in genetic sequences. It is known that regions directly involved in biochemical functions, such as binding surfaces, experience different selection pressure from other regions on the surface of proteins In view of the evidence that associates the FnIII domains of the IR to insulin binding, we have attempted to map the evolutionarily conserved regions of these domains in order to predict those specific residues that might contact insulin. Homologous amino acid sequences of the IR family ectodomain in mammals, birds, amphibians and fish were retrieved from public databases through a BLAST search, and were then classified into three different orthologous sets corresponding to the IR, IGF1R and IRR. Each set was subsequently aligned and evolutionary conservation scores at each amino acid position were calculated for the IR and IGF1R using the Rate4Site algorithm Through this amino acid conservation analysis we reconstructed the phylogeny of the IR family and predicted with significant accuracy the location of the well studied binding site 1 of the IGF1R and IR. We have also predicted the potential location of insulin binding site 2 on the FnIII-1 and FnIII-2 surface of the IR. We have also suggested a possible mechanical trigger of the activation of the IR on the basis of normal modes analysis of the low-frequency vibrations of this receptor. Finally, a strong selective pressure was found amongst the IRR orthologous sequences, suggesting that this orphan receptor has a yet unknown physiological role which may be conserved from amphibians to mammals. Invertebrates possess only a single homologous receptor of the IR family A significant step in the evolution of the IR family has been the transition from a single invertebrate IR that regulates both growth and metabolism to two different and specialised receptors that are able to recognise and discriminate their specific ligands: the IR and the IGF1R in vertebrates In order to study the phylogenetic relationships between the distinct members of the IR family, a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) including the 55 vertebrate ectodomain sequences listed in Maximum likelihood phylogeny of the IR family ectodomain inferred from amino acid sequences. The tree shown was the best one found (ln Both the IR and IRR contain an additional exon (exon 11) with respect to IGF1R. In the IR, it gives rise to the two different IR-A and IR-B isoforms, whereas in the IRR this exon is constitutively expressed as part of the receptor. A recent study traced the presence of the alternatively spliced exon 11 of the IR, showing that it is a novel acquisition of mammals A possible selective advantage conferred by the evolutionary acquisition of exon 11 by the IR is explained by the fact that isoform B is predominantly expressed in insulin target tissues that are involved in glucose homeostasis With the increasing amounts of DNA and amino acid sequences available in public databases, performing comparative multi-species phylogenomics studies is now feasible. In this study, the MSAs corresponding to the IR and IGF1R ectodomain orthologous sets were used to estimate conservation scores with the Rate4Site algorithm under the maximum-likelihood model. The conservation scores were projected onto the crystal structures of the IR family, as available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB IDs: 2DTG, 1IGR, 2HR7), by using the ConSurf server In the IR dimer structure, the first three domains of each monomer are packed against the three FnIII domains of the other monomer, in such a way that the L1 and L2 domains from each monomer correspondingly interact with the FnIII-3 and the FnIII-1 domains of the other monomer. This figure shows the general conservation of the two faces of a single IR ectodomain monomer: facing towards both (A) outside and (B) inside of the dimer. A comparison of the overall conservation of the first three domains of both the IGF1R and IR is shown in Amino acid conservation in the L1-CR-L2 domains of the (A) IGF1R and (B) IR. The rectangles indicate the regions that are believed to be involved in ligand binding and the circled regions in B indicate the location of the major specificity regions between the IR and IGF1R. An additional intra-chain disulphide bridge is situated between residues A6 and A11 The most widely accepted model of insulin binding suggests that the insulin molecule comprises two separate binding surfaces, denominated as site 1 and site 2 There is considerable evidence that a conformational change involving the C-terminal of insulin B chain occurs upon binding The conserved surfaces on the L1 and CR domains of the IGF1R and IR, when contrasted with the available mutagenesis data, reveal the strong correlation between the degree of evolutionary conservation of an amino acid position and its functional role, such as, in this case, its participation in a protein-protein binding interface. Interestingly, we found that residues Tyr28, His30, Trp79 and Arg240 of the IGF1R have diverged from their corresponding residues in the IR and IRR: His, Gln, Ser/Tre and His. Cross-linking studies revealed that two consecutive insulin residues, PheB24 and PheB25, contact two different domains of the IR: L1 and ID, respectively Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the ID have indicated that residues Thr704, Phe705, Glu706, Tyr708, Leu709, His710, Asn711 and Phe714 display a considerable loss in insulin binding affinity upon mutation Residues within the 700\u2013715 fragment of the IR have been implicated in ligand binding. This logo representation also shows the corresponding residues in the IGF1R and IRR. Data is listed in A shortened IR, consisting of residues 1\u2013601 and 650\u2013719, displays the same insulin binding properties as the holoreceptor, suggesting that all residues needed for high affinity binding are located within these regions In this work, a region of conserved residues on the FnIII surface that face the proposed L1 domain binding site in the IR was identified. However, no experimental evidence that could provide insight into the functional role of this surface was found reported in the RILM database Evolutionary Trace (ET) was performed on the 20 IR sequences in order to compare with ConSurf predictions. Each IR features two binding sites. Each one of them is formed by two components: binding site 1 is contained in the first three domains of one monomer, and comprises the conserved surface on L1 and the carboxy-terminal of the ID, which could not be crystallised in the IR ectodomain structure. Residues that are predicted to be involved in forming the receptor second binding site, and the corresponding residues at the same positions in the IGF1R and IRR, are listed in The IR is a highly glycosylated protein, comprising both N- and O-linked glycosylation sites The figure shows the IR dimer structure. These residues may provide structural flexibility to this region, and may also play a specific role in preventing aggregation, as suggested by previous studies From our results, it is clear that the L2 domain of the IR plays an important structural role in dimer formation through its interaction with the FnIII-1 domain from the other monomer, and that it contributes to the adoption of the \u201cinverted V\u201d conformation of the monomer through its interaction with the FnIII-1 domain from the same monomer. Furthermore, the contribution of the L2 domain to ligand binding in the IGF1R and IRR is still unclear. Interestingly, in an attempt to develop insulin mimetic peptides, the use of phage display methodologies led to the discovery of three groups of peptides unrelated in sequence to insulin that recognise three different sites on the IR surface Likewise, it has been reported that the soluble ectodomain of the IR shows only low-affinity ligand binding, unless it is tethered by transmembrane anchors, leucine zippers or Fc domains Our residue conservation analysis reveals that, although a portion of the conserved surface on the FnIII domains points directly towards the conserved L1 surface, a slight rotation of the FnIII-1/FnIII-2 domains would be needed in order for the conserved surface to adopt an orientation that allows it to fully contact the insulin binding site 2. To test the likelihood of this conformational change, we performed a normal modes analysis (NMA) of a single IR monomer in order to predict its low frequency, high amplitude intrinsic vibrations. A possible full rotation of the FnIII-2/FnIII-3 domains upon ligand binding could also act as a mechanical trigger for signal transduction in the tyrosine kinase domain of the IR. Whilst the recent determination of the intact ectodomain structure of the IR by X-ray crystallography has provided new insights into the 3D arrangement of the receptor domains, a full understanding of its interactions with insulin and its functional activation remains elusive. The IR family thus remains a complex but interesting system of study, particularly as the physiological functions of heterodimeric receptors and the IRR are yet to be discovered. The physiological role of the IR/IGF1R hetero-dimers is unknown and the physiological role of IRR is yet to be established. Our sequence analysis indicates that IRR is highly conserved throughout evolution, from In this study, amino acid residue conservation scores have revealed the different degrees of purifying selection acting on the protein surface of the IR and IGF1R. The insulin binding model that proposes that insulin cross-links both receptor monomers in the IR also suggests that this is not needed for IGF-1 binding, which only requires binding site 1. This idea is supported by chimeric construct experiments that have shown that both IR-A/IGF1R and IR-B/IGF1R hybrids behave like the IGF1R. Further crystallographic structures of both the low- and high-affinity ligand/receptor complexes for the IR and IGF1R are required to establish unambiguously the specific interactions involved in ligand binding and receptor structural components involved in these interactions, as well as to understand the nature of the structural transitions that lead to the activation of the receptor kinase. A BLAST (tblastn) Additional modifications were made to the following sequences: Bos Taurus IR mRNA was found to be reported in three separate but overlapping transcripts and was merged manually by removing the overlapping regions. Similarly, two different but complementary mRNAs were found for The three sets (IR, IGF1R and IRR) of orthologous sequences listed in Bayesian (By) and maximum likelihood (ML) tree searches were conducted using the MSAs produced by MUSCLE of the IR family ectodomain, residues N-terminal from His1 or C-terminal from Leu909 (human IR numbering as in the crystal structure) were not taken into account in the alignments. ML tree searches were performed with PhyML 2.4.5 The overall resolution of Bayesian and ML trees was evaluated by computing diverse descriptive statistics of the SH-like The conservation scores at each amino acid position were calculated with the Rate4Site algorithm Evolutionary Trace calculations were performed by running the ET Wizard module coupled into the Evolutionary Trace Viewer 2.0 remotely, providing the IR MSA and the 2PDB E chain as input.

Consistent with this notion, UBC13 ablation renders cells more sensitive to IR than does ablation of RNF8 ( Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) mediate the removal and processing of ubiquitin and are functionally important for regulated chromatin binding during the DDR.", "The CE reversed the expression of the impaired IR, IRS1, IRS2 and Akt1 mRNA levels and inhibited the overexpression of MTP and SREBP1c mRNA levels of enterocytes.", "All neuronal NeuN-IR neurons visible on the 40 \u00b5m thick micrographs were counted for profile counting ( The IPSCs recorded from the MD and PV neurons in the presence of glutamatergic antagonists were completely blocked by 100 \u00b5M bicuculline (data not shown) confirming that they were GABAAR mediated currents. In contrast to sIPSCs which principally reflect activation of synaptically located GABAAR, eIPSCs, in view of increased multiquantal release of GABA, are likely generated by activation of both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAAR ( Application of zolpidem shifted the baseline holding current in both control and epileptic MD ( Application of PB (250 and 500 \u00b5M) resulted in a consistent inward shift in baseline holding current of MD ( We then examined for changes in the IR of GAD-65 (the presynaptic marker of GABAergic synapses), and the \u03b11, \u03b22/3, and \u03b32 subunits of the GABAAR in epilepsy. While the possibility of cell loss accounting for decreased GABAAR-IR cannot be excluded in the epileptic MD thalamus; however, in the epileptic PV thalamus, the unaltered number of NeuN positive neurons suggests that the reduced immunoreactivity to the \u03b11 and \u03b22/3 subunit of the GABAAR may indeed be due to reduced expression of these subunits. Interestingly, despite cell loss in the epileptic MD, the \u03b32-IR was similar to that of control MD thalamus. Distribution of \u03b11, \u03b22/3, \u03b32, of the GABAAR, and GAD-IR in thalamus captured at low magnification (2x, NA = 0.1) to demonstrate different intensity of staining at different areas. The \u03b11, \u03b22/3, \u03b32, and GAD-IR were expressed in most thalamic nuclei, and the entire thalamus appeared uniformly stained for these subunits, except for the reticular nucleus and the habenula or hippocampus (A\u2013D). The staining was diffuse, and individual neurons could not be readily distinguished, except that of \u03b11-IR in hippocampal dentate gyrus (A). The distribution of IR of \u03b11 (A), \u03b22/3 (B), and \u03b32 (C) subunits was similar and found to be present as many small diffuse clusters and some large clusters. GAD65-IR and \u03b32 IR in MD and PV nucleus of control and epileptic animals. Compared to controls (A), the GAD65-IR was reduced in intensity in MD (MD is circled) of epileptic animals (B). In contrast, in both MD and PV, \u03b32 IR was similar in control (C) and epileptic (D) animals. Quantification of GAD65-IR showed a significant (p<0.05, unpaired t test) reduction in MD nucleus of epileptic animals (E).", "Mice lacking the IR are born at term and have a normal size. The IGF-IR deficient mice on the other hand have a reduced body weight and die shortly after birth due to respiratory failure possibly caused by muscle hypoplasia . Human leprechaun patients that lack functional IR have a phenotype intermediate of the IR/IGF\u2013IR\u2013KO phenotypes of mice with pronounced growth retardation and only mild diabetes . showed that IGF-I induces glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in IR myotubes with a potency close to that of insulin in wildtype cells . Also in other cell types such as adipocytes, both the IR and the IGF-IR have been shown to have the same potential to stimulate DNA synthesis, glucose transport, and induction of GLUT4 gene expression . The results of these studies show that IGF-I is capable of inducing a potent metabolic response via activation of the IGF-IR. The so-called MIRKO mice knocked out for the IR specifically in skeletal muscle remain normoglycemic and develop only mild insulin resistance suggesting that a compensatory mechanism exists in this tissue . This compensatory mechanism could prove to be IGF-IR action. Another study has shown that intraperitoneal administration of IGF-I to IR-KO mice decreases plasma glucose levels . It has been suggested that this effect is achieved through IGF-IR action in skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle expresses both the IR and the IGF-IR . Studies of muscle cell lines and primary human skeletal muscle cells have indicated that differentiation is coupled to an increase in IR expression and a decrease in IGF-IR expression . found that differentiation of adult human skeletal muscle cells is associated with an increase of both IR and IGF-IR . The mRNA level of the IR and the IGF-IR was determined by qRT-PCR in all cultures. Additionally, IR and IGF-IR levels expressed on the cell surface were determined in primary human skeletal muscle cells and the amount of binding sites per cell for each ligand was determined in a human myoblast cell line using radioactive binding assays. On the gene expression level, it was found by qRT-PCR in the same cultures as used for the microarray study that the expression of both IR and IGF-IR increased with differentiation, however, slightly more so for the IGF-IR than for the IR (36% compared to 28%) (A). Additionally, the mRNA level of the IGF-IR was around five times higher than that of the IR in both primary myoblasts and myotubes (B). Using this approach it was found that human myoblasts had approximately 12 times more IGF-IR than IR on the cell surface (C). Additionally, IR and IGF-IR amounts were determined on the protein level in primary human skeletal muscle cells. In the attempt to explain the lack of insulin response in the myoblasts, we investigated the level of IR and IGF-IR in these cells. Radioactive binding assays using both primary human skeletal muscle cells and a human skeletal muscle cell line showed that myoblasts express substantially more of the IGF-IR than the IR on the cell surface (C and D). We also investigated the mRNA levels of the two receptors in the primary human myoblasts used in the microarray experiments by qRT-PCR experiments and found that IGF-IR mRNA was about five times more abundant than IR mRNA (B). Since there is a clear abundance of IGF-IRs compared to IRs in the myoblasts it is likely that the low amount of IR will almost entirely be trapped in hybrid receptors consisting of one IR-half and one IGF-IR-half. These receptors behave as IGF-IRs in terms of ligand binding, receptor affinity, receptor autophosphorylation, and hormone internalization and degradation . Binding experiments in primary human myotubes showed that the level of IGF-IR on the cell surface is much higher than the level of IR in these cells (D). The mRNA levels of the IR and the IGF-IR were determined by qRT-PCR experiments in the primary myotubes used in the microarray study, and IGF-IRs were found to be five times more abundant than IRs (B). The abundance of IGF-IR compared to IR again corresponds with the lower effect of insulin compared to IGF-I on gene expression in the myotubes. Speculatively, the fact that IGF-I has a slightly higher affinity for the IGF-IR than insulin for the IR might further increase the IGF-I response compared to insulin when stimulating with the same concentration of either ligand. By comparing receptor levels before and after differentiation, we found that the expression of both IR and IGF-IR increases with differentiation. Our report of increased levels of both IR and IGF-IR after differentiation supports as well as contradicts previous studies. It has formerly been shown that skeletal muscle expresses both the IR and the IGF-IR . However, studies of muscle cell lines and primary human skeletal muscle cells have indicated that differentiation is coupled to an increase in IR expression and a decrease in IGF-IR expression . (2000) found that differentiation of adult human skeletal muscle cells is associated with an increase of both IR and IGF-IR . Furthermore, it is likely that not only the total amount of receptors, but also the ratio of IR/IGF-IR in a given cell plays a role in insulin/IGF-I responses . This can as in the case of gene regulation again possibly be explained by the higher abundance of IGF-IR compared to IR in these cells. Overall, in the myoblasts, insulin did not have any significant effect on gene expression, which corresponded with very low levels of IR in these cells. These results can at least partly be explained by the excess of IGF-IR compared to IR, although we cannot exclude that other factors play a role in the differential sensitivity of muscle cells to insulin versus IGF-I.", "One rat died from the diabetic-control, three rats from diabetes + IR, and one rat from the treatment group. There was no significant change in fasting blood glucose level in the diabetic control and diabetes + IR groups in comparison to their baseline values. Pre-treatment with kaempferol (20 mg/kg) for 28 days decreased the blood glucose level as compared to the diabetic control and diabetes + IR group ( IR injury in diabetic rats resulted in significant decreases in GSH ( The role of apoptosis in myocardial injury was assessed by studying the expression of anti and pro-apoptotic proteins by immunohistochemistry. There was increased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Caspase-3) and decreased expression of an anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2) in the myocardium of the diabetic-IR group. In the diabetes + IR group, there was an increased number of TUNEL positive nuclei. On the contrary, kaempferol pretreatment decreased the expression of pro-apoptotic protein and TUNEL positive cells and increased the expression of anti-apoptotic protein, and thus attenuated the apoptotic change observed in the myocardium ( The diabetes + IR group had significantly ( The activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) causes the release of inflammatory cytokines. In the diabetes + IR group, there was a significant ( There was increased serum levels of AGEs in the diabetic control and diabetic-IR groups. The increased AGE will bind to its receptor, i.e., RAGE, thus there was increased levels of RAGE in the diabetic control and diabetes + IR groups. Treatment with kaempferol for 28 days significantly suppressed the AGEs ( In the diabetic-IR group, there was significantly increased phosphorylation of JNK ( On ultrastructural examination, diabetes + IR rats revealed the disruption of cristae, and swollen and irregular mitochondria with nuclear and chromatin condensation in the myocardium. Diabetic adults are 2\u20134 times are more likely to develop cardiovascular diseases as compared to non-diabetic adults [ Kaempferol has been shown to exert beneficial effects through the modulation of the MAPK pathway [ Various studies have shown that AGE-RAGE axis is involved in the development of diabetic complications such as diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, and cardiomyopathy [ Previous studies have also demonstrated that AGE-RAGE promotes excess synthesis of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) and causes oxidative stress that further exacerbates the progression of diabetes and its complications [ A large number of studies support the concept of RAGE mediated MAPK activation [ The association of inflammation with myocardial IR injury is well known [ In conclusion, the pre-treatment of diabetic rats with kaempferol significantly ameliorated IR-induced myocardial injury by normalization of hemodynamic parameters, maintaining oxidant-antioxidant status, reducing inflammation and apoptosis, and by inhibiting the MAPK/AGE-RAGE pathways. exerted a significant cardioprotective effect as compared to the two lower doses, 5 and 10 mg/kg [ A total of 34 diabetic rats were distributed into 3 groups: (Diabetic control; (Diabetes + IR; (Diabetes + Kaempferol 20 + IR; On the 28th day, rats were anesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium (60 mg/kg; i.p.).", "We found that ACOT7 depletion induced cytostasis through the PKC To examine changes in the gene expression profile of irradiated cancer cells, we conducted gene expression analysis of an IR-exposed MCF7 human breast carcinoma. This study involving human tissues was approved by the Asan Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB Approval No. ACOT7 is downregulated in IR-exposed and Doxo-treated cells. ( Synergistic anti-tumoral effect of NDGA treatment in combination with IR or Doxo. MCF7 cells were treated with NDGA prior to exposure to 2 Gy of IR or to treatment with 10 ng/ml of Doxo.", "Despite the many well-validated metrics for systemic IR, the absence of biomarkers for brain-specific IR represents a translational gap that has hindered its study in living humans. In our lab, we have been working to develop biomarkers that reflect the common mechanisms of brain IR and AD that may be used to follow their engagement by experimental treatments. We present two promising biomarkers for brain IR in AD: insulin cascade mediators probed in extracellular vesicles (EVs) enriched for neuronal origin, and two-dimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measures of brain glucose. As further evidence for a fundamental link between brain IR and AD, we provide a novel analysis demonstrating the close spatial correlation between brain expression of genes implicated in IR (using Allen Human Brain Atlas data) and tau and beta-amyloid pathologies. We proceed to propose the bold hypotheses that baseline differences in the metabolic reliance on glycolysis, and the expression of glucose transporters (GLUT) and insulin signaling genes determine the vulnerability of different brain regions to Tau and/or Amyloid beta (A\u03b2) pathology, and that IR is a critical link between these two pathologies that define AD. Lastly, we provide an overview of ongoing clinical trials that target IR as an angle to treat AD, and suggest how biomarkers may be used to evaluate treatment efficacy and target engagement. The binding of insulin to the insulin receptor leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (IRS1 and 2; Draznin, Persistent activation of the insulin receptor results in excessive phosphorylation of Ser and Thr residues on IRSs (Czech et al., A key physiological action of insulin is to increase glucose uptake into cells (Leney and Tavar\u00e9, While there is evidence that insulin is produced The BBB is a dynamic structure that homeostatically regulates the uptake and release rates for a variety of hormones, chemicals, and proteins (Daneman, Evidence also exists that insulin can be produced A variety of genetic, developmental, and metabolic factors underlie brain IR. Polymorphisms in the Fat Mass and Obesity-Associated Protein (FTO) gene, involving introns 1 and 2 that are highly expressed in the brain, exhibit strong effects on brain IR (Reitz et al., Dysfunctional phosphorylation of IRS-1 has been extensively linked with brain IR, similar to other tissues. Total levels of insulin signaling proteins in the aforementioned \u201cPI3K route\u201d are not significantly different in the brains of AD patients vs. cognitively normal (CN) controls, suggesting that the phosphorylated active levels of these molecules are more relevant to IR and AD pathogenesis as opposed to total levels (Talbot et al., Vascular function is tightly coupled to insulin signaling, and central to this relationship is endothelial dysfunction, which manifests through deficient vasodilation and improper vasoconstriction throughout the body in the setting of IR (Hsueh et al., Significant vascular pathology is frequently seen in older individuals with dementia. In fact, until the significance of neuritic plaques (NP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) was unequivocally demonstrated, the prevailing view was that vascular pathology is primarily responsible for the cognitive deficits in AD (Kling et al., There is emerging evidence showing that IR and diabetes have significant implications in VCID. It is well known that cerebral blood flow is decreased in diabetic patients (Jellinger, Several epidemiological studies have shown that the systemic IR state of type 2 diabetes is a major risk factor for age-related cognitive decline, dementia, AD, and progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD (Ott et al., A\u03b2 refers to several peptides between 39\u201343 amino acids in length that are formed by the sequential \u03b2 and \u03b3 secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP); a large transmembrane protein with an unknown physiologic role. In AD, tau forms intracellular NFTs, which alongside extracellular A\u03b2 NPs constitute the two main histopathological hallmarks of the disease (Brandt and Leschik, Several studies have implicated IR in tau aggregation, which largely depends on its phosphorylation state, which is in turn determined by the balance between various kinase and phosphatase activities. Short-term administration of insulin to human neuroblastoma cells or rat primary cortical neurons leads to rapid hyperphosphorylation of tau at several Ser/Thr residues, whereas prolonged exposure results in decreased phosphorylation (Lesort et al., Besides its role in the development of A\u03b2 and tau pathology, brain IR can also directly affect synaptic function and cognition. Often referred to as \u201cguilt by association\u201d, (Stuart et al., To provide further evidence for the relationship between brain IR and the propensity to develop plaques and tangles., we examined how the spatial distributions of A\u03b2-containing NPs and hyperphosphorylated tau-containing NFTs relate to the spatial expression of genes implicated in brain IR. A strong and significant positive association was seen between NFT density and expression of GLUT4 ( IRS-1 regulates insulin signaling upstream of AKT and GSK3B, and prior studies have noted a decreased overall level of IRS-1 and related pathway molecule expression in AD neurons (Steen et al., One of the main enduring mysteries in AD is the different distribution of NFTs and NPs in the disease (Arnold et al., This hypothetical paradigm is based on correlational studies but its predictions are testable (and falsifiable). For instance, it can be falsified by examining the spatial correlation of IR-related gene expression and A\u03b2 and Tau pathologies in brain specimens from subjects across the spectrum from normal cognition to AD. For these predictions to be testable though, biomarkers that reflect AD pathogenic processes, brain metabolism and IR are required. The traditional gold standard for measuring systemic IR is the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, as this technique provides highly reproducible data with a distinct physiological meaning (DeFronzo et al., EVs are membranous particles and are secreted from nearly every cell type throughout the body, whereas the term exosomes refers to a subtype of EVs from 30 nm to 150 nm in size that have been implicated in a variety of functions. To date, AD biomarkers derived from neuronal origin-enriched EVs include not only the main pathogenic proteins (p-tau and A\u03b242) but also intracellular signaling molecules, such as phosphorylated IRS-1, Cathepsin-D, REST, LRP6, and others (Fiandaca et al., In a recent study Mullins et al. As was initially shown in 1989 (Friedland et al., Conflicting findings exist on the relationship between A\u03b2 deposition and peripheral IR in PET studies using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) or Florbetapir (F18-AV-45), with some studies showing no such relationship (Edison et al., Structural and functional MRI have also been used to study IR-AD associations. In late middle-aged, cognitively healthy individuals, HOMA-IR has been negatively associated with hippocampal (Rasgon et al., As a general comment to all neuroimaging studies to date; since no good biomarker of brain IR existed, the field had to rely on the assumption that some peripheral IR measure (such as HOMA-IR) can be used as a surrogate of brain IR. With the discovery of IRS-1 phospho-peptides in neural-origin plasma EVs (Kapogiannis et al., Modern magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques have recently advanced to the point of reliable measurement of To demonstrate technical feasibility and provide proof of concept for this method, we collected JPRESS data from a set of 15 fasting healthy male volunteer participants (40.5 \u00b1 7.8 years old) who also underwent a blood draw for fasting glucose. In addition, we found a moderate negative correlation between MRS Glc brain concentrations and fasting glucose levels ( There are several approaches for targeting brain IR as a therapeutic strategy for AD. Perhaps, the most straightforward one is to try to overcome brain IR by increasing brain availability of insulin. Since systemic insulin administration in non-diabetic subjects produces hypoglycemia, the approach that has been promoted to achieve this goal is intranasal insulin administration, which involves bulk flow through the olfactory bulb into the brain (Born et al., Glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP1) agonists have been shown to offer neuroprotection (Perry et al., We are currently engaged in the analysis of IRS-1 phosphotypes and downstream signaling molecules in neuronal EVs from plasma samples from the pilot trial of exenatide in AD conducted at the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and several other clinical trials targeting IR. This article attempted to disentangle the complex mechanisms underlying brain IR, highlight proven or plausible links to A\u03b2 and tau pathologies in AD, as well as provide information about promising recent EV-based biomarkers, RJM, TCD, CWC and DK wrote and edited the manuscript; RJM, TCD and DK were responsible for experimental design and conception; and RJM performed the analyses.", "Use a gamma irradiator to expose cells to a single dose of 10 Gray (Gy) of IR; this is a typical exposure for most cell lines. Monitor the cells under a light microscope for morphological changes (see NOTE: This protocol describes senescence induced by IR. SAHF can be visualized by the reorganization of DAPI; by the presence of heterochromatin-associated histone marks, including the di- and tri-methylation of Lys9 on Histone H3 (H3K9Me2 and H3K9Me3); and by chromatin-reorganizing proteins, including HP-1 heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), HIRA (histone repressor A), and ASF1a (anti-silencing function-1a) to chromatin Grow IDH4 cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 \u03bcg/mL dexamethasone. Either with cells 10 d post-IR treatment or with replicative senescent cells (and appropriate control cells), wash the cells three times with 1x PBS and add serum-free medium with antibiotics in a small volume (2.5 mL for 6 cm or 5 mL for 10 cm). Cells were stained 7 d after IR. The medium was changed every 48 h and the cells were lysed 7 d after IR.", "IR treatment significantly elevated expression and nuclear localization of PAK4 in correlation with induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mesenchymal transition in GBM cells. In addition, IR further elevated PAK4/PPAR\u03b3 complex co-recruitment to Nox1 promoter, and increased Nox1 expression and ROS levels associated with mesenchymal transition in these cells. Conversely, specific PAK4 downregulation decreased PPAR\u03b3-mediated Nox1 expression and suppressed EMT in IR-treated cells. Incubation of the binding reaction with either PAK4 or PPAR\u03b3 antibodies in EMSA assays resulted in supershift of the oligonucleotide mobility further confirming that PAK4 is recruited to the PPAR\u03b3 consensus binding sequences ( Having confirmed PAK4/PPAR\u03b3 binding, we next investigated the specific role of PAK4 in regulating PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activity and downstream effects on PPAR\u03b3-mediated signaling in IR treatments. IP in control and IR-treated cells showed a significant upregulation and complex formation between PAK4 and PPAR\u03b3 after IR-treatment compared to controls ( To further evaluate the role of IR-induced nuclear translocation of PAK4 in transcription regulation and possible promoter binding in gliomas, we examined the interaction of PAK4 with specific TF consensus sequences using a protein-DNA interaction array. PAK4, immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts of control and IR-treated 4910 cells, was incubated with TF-consensus oligonucleotide probe mixtures to determine their interaction with PAK4 on the protein-DNA array. In contrast, IR-treated cells showed significant PAK4 binding with different TF consensus elements including an intense binding with those of PPAR\u03b3 ( PPAR\u03b3 has been implicated in tumor progression and previous reports showed the modulation of cellular ROS levels by PPAR\u03b3 agonists. To confirm the role of PAK4 in IR-induced EMT, we further treated SV- and PAK4sh-transfected glioma cells with IR for an additional 24 hours, and analyzed EMT marker expression. Upon IR-treatment, SV-transfected cells showed the expected increase in levels of PPAR\u03b3, Nox1 and N-cadherin ( To further confirm the regulation of ROS and EMT by PAK4, we subjected glioma cells to either oxidative stress using H In order to validate the Growing evidence suggests that malignant cells adopt EMT as a mechanism to develop resistance to a variety of treatments; hence in epithelial tumors such as glioblastoma, mechanisms of mesenchymal transition have emerged as drivers of resistance and as relevant targets for therapeutic intervention against such malignancies. In summary, our studies demonstrate a hitherto unreported binding of nuclear-PAK4 with PPAR\u03b3 and characterize a novel regulation of PPAR\u03b3-mediated EMT by PAK4 after IR-treatment both The highly invasive human glioma xenograft cell lines 4910 and 5310 (kindly provided by Dr. David James, University of California, San Francisco) Cells were seeded (0.5\u00d710 Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIZOL reagent and cDNAs were synthesized from 1\u00b5g of RNA samples using the SuperScript\u00ae III Reverse Transcriptase cDNA synthesis kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). (A) Real-time PCR showing Nox1 transcriptional levels in control- and IR-treated cells.", "We hypothesize that NCSC-CM has anti-inflammatory properties that could protect against IR-induced lung injury in rats. NCSC-CM treatment significantly attenuated IR-induced lung edema, as indicated by decreases in pulmonary vascular permeability, lung weight gain, wet to dry weight ratio, lung weight to body weight ratio, pulmonary arterial pressure, and protein level in BALF. Our experiment demonstrates that NCSC-CM treatment decreases IR-induced acute lung injury and that the protective mechanism may be attributable to the inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation and the inflammatory response. Therefore, NCSC-CM may be a novel approach for treating IR-induced lung injury.", "We then determined whether PTSD-associated increases in HOMA-IR were correlated with select biological variables from pathways previously hypothesized to link PTSD with cardiometabolic risk, including systemic inflammation (increased C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1), sympathetic over-activity (increased resting heart rate), and neuroendocrine dysregulation (increased plasma cortisol or serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)). We found PTSD diagnosis was associated with substantially higher HOMA-IR (cases 4.3\u00b14.3 vs controls 2.4\u00b12.0; p<0.001), and a higher frequency of MetS (cases 21.3% vs controls 2.5%; p<0.001), but not prediabetes (cases 20.0% vs controls 18.8%; p>0.05). Cases also had increased pro-inflammatory cytokines (p<0.01), heart rate (p<0.001), and BDNF (p<0.001), which together predicted increased HOMA-IR (adjusted R 2 =0.68, p<0.001). Results show PTSD diagnosis in young male military veterans without cardiometabolic disease is associated with increased IR, predicted by biological alterations previously hypothesized to link PTSD to increased cardiometabolic risk.", "Immunohistochemical study showed decreased expression of adiponectin receptor (AdipoR1) in PCOS-ovary which correlated with increased synthesis of androgen and decreased expression of IR. The treatment with adiponectin with or without LH to PCOS-ovary in vitro caused significant decline in androgen synthesis and increase in IR. This study showed the direct role of adiponectin in ameliorating hyperandrogenism and reducing IR in the ovary of PCOS-mice.", "On the other hand, a number of evidences highlight a proapoptotic role of CREB following IR treatment of cancer cells. Taking into account all these considerations, this mini-review will be focused on the involvement of CREB/ATF family members in response to IR therapy, to deepen our knowledge of this topic, and to pave the way to translation into a therapeutic context. Apoptosis can happen during interphase before division after the G2 block caused by IR (fast apoptosis) or after one or more divisions (late apoptosis). Some radiosensitive cells, such as lymphocytes, thymocytes, and intestinal crypt cells, undergo fast apoptosis without cell division after IR, while irradiated mouse leukemia cells undergo a G2 block and the apoptotic fraction begins to increase on the release from this G2 block ( Based on these findings and on the complex and various molecular interactions involving CREB/ATF family members, this mini-review will be focused on the involvement of CREB/ATF family members in response to IR exposure to deepen our insight into this matter and contribute to the understanding of CREB-mediated radio-resistance/radio-sensitivity mechanisms. Cancer cells respond to IR in a heterogeneous manner depending on their intrinsic properties (DNA repair capability, proliferation status) or extrinsic environment (degree of hypoxia within the tumor population) ( Ionizing radiation-induced damage leads to the activation of complex signaling cascades, inducing with different mechanisms DNA repair, stress response genes, cell-cycle arrest, cell death, or cell survival ( Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a group of blood disorders where hematopoietic stem cell undergoes an abnormal maturation and differentiation into one or more blood lineages. Disease progression is related to an increased genomic instability, and a high number of patients go on to develop acute myeloid leukemia ( The gastrointestinal epithelium (GI) is very sensitive to IR and chemotherapy ( Lung cancer is a malignant tumor arising from the respiratory epithelium that represents a leading cause of cancer death in both males and females worldwide. In this regard, different potential therapeutic targets have been identified in modulating IR sensitivity of various malignancies among which poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), DNA-PK, DNA ligase IV, Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN complex), and checkpoint kinase ( FDA: study and analysis of scientific literature and preparation of the manuscript and Table This review has been done in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that can be considered as a potential conflict of interest.", "The vasculature of the pit organs, which is located in close proximity to IR-sensitive terminal nerve masses (IR receptors), is finer, flatter, and more convoluted than that of other sensory organs. Using extracellular recording in vivo from IR-sensitive primary afferent trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons of the crotaline snake Trimeresurus flavoviridis, I studied the response to IR warming (24-25 degrees C) and to various chemicals: an exogenous vasoactive substance nitric oxide donor (sodium nitroprusside, SNP), endothelin-1 (ET-1), a transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV)1 agonist (capsaicin, CAP) and antagonist (capsazepine, CZP), and Ruthenium Red (RR), an antagonist of the TRPV family. IR-sensitive primary afferent TG neurons display regular background firing at 10-25 impulses per second at 24-25 degrees C. At this temperature, Ruthenium Red and endothelin-1 clearly suppressed the frequency of background firing, while sodium nitroprusside injected into the bloodstream significantly increased the frequency of discharges (P<0.01) and caused regular bursts of firing in IR-sensitive TG neurons. The possibility that these opposite responses result from their vasoactive effects on the unusual pit vasculature or from their chemical effects on the thermoreceptors of IR-sensitive nerve terminals in the pit organ, like those of the TRPV family, is discussed.", "We have now investigated the regulatory role of G(i)2-proteins in IR function. For the experiments, isolated IRs from plasma membranes of human fat cells were used. The activation of IR autophosphorylation by insulin was blocked by G-protein inactivation through GDPbetaS (guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]disphosphate). Pretreatment of the plasma membranes with pertussis toxin prevented insulin- and GTPgammaS-induced autophosphorylation, but did not disrupt the IR-G(i)2 complex. The functional nature of the IR-G(i)2 complex was made evident by insulin's ability to increase association of G(i)2 with the IR. These results define a novel mechanism by which insulin signalling mediates tyrosine kinase activity and autophosphorylation of the IR through recruitment of G(i)-proteins.", "Our study is consistent with the hypothesis that insulin resistance may be an underlying mechanism responsible for the observed increased relative risk for AD neuropathology, and presents the first evidence to suggest that IR signaling can influence Abeta production in the brain.", "Second, consequences of neurohumoral stimulation such as oxidative stress and inflammation are highlighted with regard to IR. Beyond the hypoglycemic action, insulin activates the sympathetic nervous system, while withdrawing the vagal component of the ANS [ Obesity is a major risk factor for T2D [ Relationships between known risk factors for T2D, neurohumoral factors and consequences thereof including oxidative stress and inflammatory response leading to peripheral IR and T2D. On the one hand, sympathetic activation may increase energy expenditure [ Mechanistically, a reduced nitric-oxide (NO) availability may be involved in the evolution of sympatho-excitation given the fact that certain eNOS polymorphisms are concomitant with a higher T2D and IR susceptibility [ Furthermore, life-style modifications such as exercise may restore ANS function in T2D or in precursor states via restoration of cardiovascular reflexes [ The individual players of the overall concept of neurohumoral stimulation must still be characterized. As Figure Oxidative stress is a candidate mechanism connecting neurohumoral stimulation with IR [ Suggested therapeutic interventions with regard to the framework of T2D risk factors and neurohumoral factors given in Figure Inflammatory responses are likely to be due to oxidative-stress mediated alterations of cytokine expression including interleukin-6 [ The summarized evidence suggests that neuroendocrine mechanisms participate in T2D evolution. Therefore, we propose the hypothesis that ANS dysfunction, most likely sympathetic-nervous-system activation, represents one cause of IR likely to be mediated by oxidative-stress induced inflammation.", "In order to test this assumption, we studied the effects of KIFMK and its related (KIYEK, KIQMK, and DIYET) and unrelated (LPFFD) peptides on tyrosine phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of IR in vitro. Purified IR was phosphorylated in vitro with insulin in the presence of various synthetic peptides and lignocaine. The phosphorylation level of IR was then evaluated after SDS-PAGE separation, followed by Western blot analysis with antiphosphotyrosine antibody. KIFMK and KIYEK inhibited insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of IR. The structurally unrelated peptide LPFFD had no effect either on phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of IR. These results indicate that KIFMK, KIYEK, and lignocaine bind with the autophosphorylation sites of IR.", "", "Ablation of CBP or p300 impaired IR-induced DSB repair and sensitized lung cancer cells to IR and the anti-cancer drug, etoposide, which induces DSBs that are repaired by NHEJ.", "Activation of the CS via mannose binding lectin (MBL)-initiated lectin pathway is known to increase tissue damage in response to IR in muscle, myocardium and intestine tissue. In contrast, the contribution of this pathway to cerebral IR injury, a neutrophil-mediated event, is less clear. Therefore, we investigated the potential protective role of MBL deficiency in neutrophil-mediated cerebral injury after IR. Systemic neutrophil activation was not decreased in MBL-deficient animals after IR. Unfortunately, estimates indicate that as our population ages, the occurrence of stroke will dramatically increase 43% over the next sixteen years [ Activation of the complement system (CS) contributes to the inflammatory sequel of cerebral IR injury. The CS, a component of the innate immune system, is comprised of three activation pathways (alternative, classical and lectin) that lead to a common terminal pathway, summarized by It is well known that activated neutrophils, a component of cell mediated inflammatory responses, increase cerebral IR injury [ Investigations examining complement-mediated cerebral IR injury after ischemic stroke and reperfusion burgeoned approximately ten years ago. Initial lines of inquiry examined the effects of total CS protein depletion, inhibition of all three activating pathways or inhibition of the terminal pathway on cerebral IR injury; the majority of these studies found significant neuroprotection [ To date, the role of the lectin activation pathway in cerebral IR injury is limited [ C57Bl/6 (MBL MBL, C1q and factor D gene expression (activators of the lectin, classical, and alternative pathway, respectively) has not been adequately described after experimental cerebral IR. In an initial set of experiments, gene expression of MBL-A, MBL-C, C1q, and factor D was measured after cerebral IR (in MBL The temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and sham procedures were performed as previously described [ Gene expression of MBL-A, MBL-B, C1q, and factor D was examined to elucidate modalities of CS activation during cerebral IR injury. As is evident from representative images of brain injury in MBL Brain edema in MBL deficient mice was decreased by 44% when compared to the MBL Because MBL deficiency had only a modest effect in limiting cerebral injury, we next assessed CS activation in response to IR injury. Immunofluorescent C3 deposits were not observed in the uninjured contralateral hemispheres of MBL We next investigated gene expression of C1q and factor D, important components of classical and alternative CS pathways, in response to stroke and reperfusion injury in wild type MBL To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the postulate that MBL-initiated lectin pathway activation of the CS enhances neutrophil-mediated IR injury after ischemic stroke. It is well known that activated neutrophils significantly increase cerebral injury after IR via multiple mechanisms including: the \u201cno-reflow\u201d phenomena, caused by neutrophil microvascular occlusion; release of toxic substances such as ROS and proteases; and systemic and local release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [ CS activation is known to enhance neutrophil activation, mediated primarily by anaphylatoxin C5a [ The liver is the primary site of MBL-A and -C production although these gene products are also known to be produced in other tissues, including the brain [ As the effects of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a on neutrophil activation in mouse whole blood had not previously been reported, it was important to verify their effects in this study. Others have used immunohistochemistry techniques to measure C3 deposits in situ after injury or infection as a measure of non-pathway specific complement activation after IR [ Gene expression of factor D and C1q, activators of the alternative and classical activation pathways respectively, has not been examined in the setting of cerebral IR. Ideally, direct inhibition of MBL following cerebral IR is needed, but specific inhibitors of murine MBL-A and -C do not exist at the present time. Instead, the majority of cerebral IR injury research has centered on non-specific inhibition of all three CS activation pathways.", "Further investigation of the efficacy of EP to modulate IR injury in a larger animal model of IR injury is warranted. IR and contralateral limbs were then harvested and the posterior hind-limb calf muscle was isolated and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for biochemical analysis. Skeletal muscle tissue cytokine and MPO levels, and histologic assessment in treated and untreated mice after 24 hours of reperfusion were compared with each other using unpaired Levels of NF- The levels of L-lactate in skeletal muscle of mice receiving the pre-I protocol after 90 minutes of ischemia and 24 hours of reperfusion are shown in The percent contralateral muscle ATP levels after 90 minutes of unilateral ischemia followed by 24 hours of reperfusion for the pre-I and post-I protocol groups are displayed in IL-1 KC levels were decreased in limbs of EP- versus LR-treated mice subjected to the pre-I (EP, 6.7 pg/mg protein \u00b1 1.6 pg/mg protein vs. 14.3 pg/mg protein \u00b1 2.3 pg/mg protein; MPO levels were also decreased in EP- versus LR-treated animals subjected to pre-I (30.3 ng/mg protein \u00b1 5.4 ng/mg protein vs. 49.7 ng/mg protein \u00b1 6.8 ng/mg protein, respectively; TAT-III complexes were significantly decreased in EP-versus LR-treated hind-limbs subjected to the pre-I (1.71 ng/mg protein \u00b1 0.20 ng/mg protein vs. 3.01 ng/mg protein \u00b1 0.29 ng/mg protein, respectively; The percent of total fibers that were injured were significantly lower in EP- versus LR-treated animals subjected to the pre-I (4.49% \u00b1 0.54% vs. 20.1% \u00b1 1.05%, respectively; In this model of acute hind-limb IR, EP preserved skeletal muscle energy levels, decreased fiber injury, and decreased the levels of inflammatory and prothrombotic markers. These results are of clinical importance because of two reasons: (1) morbidity and mortality associated with acute lower limb IR in humans remains high; Because NF- A consequence of IR is the depletion of NAD EP administered using the pre-I and post-I protocols increased skeletal muscle ATP levels after IR in a manner similar to the observed increase in lactate ( Alternatively, EP might preserve ATP levels through pathways dependent on the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase. It is also possible that the higher levels of tissue ATP associated with EP administration may be a consequence of preserved tissue viability because of a decrease in the inflammatory and thrombotic components of IR injury. IL-1 Further analysis of the anti-inflammatory cascade showed that EP administered using the pre-I but not the post-I protocol significantly decreased the levels of MPO compared with LR-treated samples ( Thrombosis is a well-recognized consequence of IR. EP preserved ATP and decreased levels of inflammatory and thrombotic markers during hind-limb IR in a mouse model. The metabolic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic properties of EP ameliorate the multicomponent nature of IR in skeletal muscle. The pleiotropic properties of EP make it a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of hind-limb IR injury. Mice treated with EP in the pre-I and post-I protocols markedly ( Percentage of injured fibers in EP- versus LR-treated animals: EP treatment in the pre-I and post-I protocols resulted in significant reduction of injured fibers after IR ( Supported by the National Institutes of Health grant 1R01AR055843, the American Diabetes Association, the Pacific Vascular Research Foundation, and the Department of Surgery, Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital.", "Mice were injected with liposomes or PBS 24 h before IR, at the time of surgery, and every 24 h until sacrifice. The ATP-liposome treatment reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, including that of interleukin 1\u03b2 ( ATP-liposome treatment of IR-challenged neural tissues suppressed necrosis and correlated with a significantly reduced level of inflammation and retinal damage. Mice were injected intramuscularly (IM) with either liposomes (0.5 mg [or 13.2 mM] suspension in PBS per animal) or carrier buffer (PBS) 24 h before IR, at the time of surgery, and then every 24 h until sacrifice. Retinas were collected and analyzed 1 or 7 days after IR. Thus, in tissue treated by ATP-liposomes, reduced necrotic cell death could contribute to a diminished inflammatory response in tissue after IR injury. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed total RNA extracted from the IR-exposed retinas for the abundance of transcript for pro-inflammatory genes. Retinas were analyzed 24 h post reperfusion because most changes in gene expression for pro-inflammatory factors typically occur shortly after IR injury. We applied ATP-liposomes in vitro and in vivo to test whether restoration of intracellular ATP levels protects retinal neurons against IR injury. Our results showed that treatment with ATP-liposomes resulted in significant increase in survival of neurons challenged with IR. Such increased tolerance of inner retinal neurons to IR injury correlated with increased levels of ATP in the retinas of treated animals and reduced cell death by necrosis in both cultured cells and in ischemic retinas. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that sufficient levels of intracellular ATP delivered by liposomes protect cells from energy failure caused by IR injury. This is in a good agreement with studies where ATP-liposomes greatly increased the number of ischemic episodes tolerated before brain electrical silence and death appeared [ Inflammation is a pathologic hallmark of IR injury that spatiotemporally correlates to the delayed phase of cell death [ In conclusion, this work represents the first report on protection from IR injury in the retina induced by ATP-liposomes. Our results suggest that suppressing neuronal necrosis using ATP-liposomes in the IR-challenged neural tissues could promote a neuroprotective environment and reduce tissue damage.", "Despite the absence of apparent IR in DEX-1 rats, this group exhibited increased circulating insulin levels and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), compared to the CTL group (p<0.05). Evident IR as well as marked hyperinsulinemia and GSIS, as judged by the static and dynamic insulin secretion values, were observed in DEX-3 and DEX-5 rats (p<0.05). We conclude that short-term dexamethasone treatment (DEX-1) induces an increase in beta-cell function that does not require the presence of discernible IR. As the treatment continues, the IR develops rapidly, and increased insulin secretion as well as beta-cell hyperplasia is demanded for the appropriate maintenance of glucose homeostasis.", "Here we examined the role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in skeletal muscle insulin resistance using LPS challenge in rats and mice as Pharmacological (aminoguanidine) and genetic strategies (iNOS Our work demonstrates that iNOS-mediated tyrosine nitration of IRS-1 is a key mechanism of skeletal muscle insulin resistance in endotoxemia, and presents nitrosative modification of insulin signaling proteins as a novel therapeutic target for combating muscle insulin resistance in inflammatory settings. We showed that administration of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a model of acute systemic inflammation, induces iNOS in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue Targeted protein S-nitrosylation is one form of nitrosative modification that has been suggested to contribute to the insulin desensitizing actions of iNOS Indeed, NO is also known to readily react with superoxide (O To study the role of iNOS in muscle IR, we treated rats with LPS in the presence or absence of the iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine. D) IRS-1 associated PI 3-kinase activity was measured in muscle of LPS +/\u2212 aminoguanidine (150 mg/kg) treated animals. We next investigated the influence of iNOS induction on insulin sensitivity We had previously reported that iNOS induction causes IR at least in part through inhibition of IRS-1 associated PI 3-kinase Since aminoguanidine can also inhibit the formation of advanced glycation endproducts Wild type iNOS To gain further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying iNOS-induced IR we next examined IRS-1 tyrosine nitration and phosphorylation in skeletal muscle from saline and LPS-treated iNOS A) Skeletal muscle lysates from wild type iNOS We next explored whether iNOS-mediated IR and IRS-1 tyrosine nitration could be recapitulated The effect of cyto/LPS on basal (panel A) and insulin stimulated (panel B) glucose uptake was measured in L6 muscle cells treated with TNF-\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), IFN-\u03b3 (200 units/ml) and LPS (10 \u00b5g/ml) for 24 hours, +/\u2212 1400 W expressed as fold change or percent insulin action respectively. (E) Basal glucose transport in the presence of increasing concentrations of ONOO We also studied the effect of epigallocathechin gallate (EGCG), an alternative inhibitor of the iNOS pathway, in cytokine/LPS treated skeletal myocytes Reminiscent of the PI 3-kinase was measured in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates of L6 cells treated with A) cyto/LPS with TNF-\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), IFN-\u03b3 (200 units/ml) and LPS (10 \u00b5g/ml) for 24 hours, +/\u2212 iNOS inhibitor 1400 W (0,1 mM), B) +/\u2212 EGCG (10 \u00b5M) or C) in cells directly treated for 1 hour with ONOO Since free ONOO A) Protein lysates from cells treated with and cytokines +/\u2212 the iNOS inhibitor 1400 W (0.1 mM) were immunoprecipitated with anti-nitrotyrosine antibody and then immunoblotted with anti-IRS-1 antibody or immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 antibody and then immunoblotted with anti-nitrotyrosine antibody. B) Protein lysates from cells treated with increasing doses of ONOO We next determined whether nitration of IRS-1 on tyrosine residues could decrease its capacity for insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. To do so we measured IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in cells treated with insulin in the absence or presence of ONOO The advent of metabolic endotoxemia as an important contributor to obesity-linked inflammation and IR has renewed scientific interest in defining the mechanisms underlying LPS-induced perturbations in glucose metabolism Until now our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which iNOS mediates IR in skeletal muscle was limited to NO mediated S-nitrosylation Our report of a negative role for elevated tyrosine nitration in skeletal muscle cells exposed to cytokines and LPS or authentic ONOO Although studies in cells had previously shown the potential for authentic ONOO One report showed that increasing ONOO In conclusion, the present results obtained from rats, mice and L6 myocytes in culture strongly suggest that ONOO This study was approved by the Animal Care and Handling Committee of Laval University (authorization number 08-032 and 00-041). The immune complex was washed three times in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1% NP-40 and 2 mmol/l Na Cell or tissue lysates (500 \u00b5g) were immunoprecipitated with 2 \u00b5g of anti-IRS-1 coupled to protein A-Sepharose overnight at 4\u00b0C. PI 3-kinase activity was determined as previously described Cell and tissue lysates (500 \u00b5g of protein) were immunoprecipitated with either 2 \u00b5g of IRS-1 antibody or 2 \u00b5g of anti-nitrotyrosine antibody coupled to protein G-Sepharose overnight at 4\u00b0C.", "However, relatively few studies examine the detailed biochemical changes occurring during normothermic (warm) IR. The objective of this work was to establish an experimental lung autotransplant model to be carried out on pigs in order to study the early stages of normothermic lung IR. An experimental model of normothermic lung IR injury is presented and detailed changes in hemodynamic, gasometric and biochemical parameters are shown. Both the model and the studied parameters may be clinically useful in future investigations testing new therapies to prevent normothermic IR induced lung injury.", "", "We show here that explicit considerations of IR interactions with these systems further changes the ET kinetics. Analysis in the framework of Floquet theory reveals that interaction with an IR field may increase the probability of inelastic tunneling and thus enhance the ET rate for a system in which elastic ET is forbidden. It is shown that IR driving of a nuclear oscillator promotes the oscillator into excited states that couple more strongly to the tunneling electron. Furthermore, it is shown that IR driving may suppress the ET rate in this same system, depending on system energetics. Effects of IR on ET rates in the symmetry-allowed system are weaker with enhancements up to 34% over the undriven rate and suppression of about 3% with IR driving present. This study is the first theoretical and computational exploration of ET rate control by IR irradiation of the bridge.", "Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) experiments were also performed to compare the dynamics of interaction of the IR with these mutants. Basal BRET, which mainly reflects the interaction of PTP1B with the IR precursor during its biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, was markedly increased with the PTP1B-D181A-Y46F mutant. I(125) insulin binding experiments indicated that PTP1B-D181-Y46F reduced the expression of IR at the plasma membrane. Reduced expression at the cell surface was associated with higher amounts of the uncleaved IR precursor in the cell. Moreover, we observed that substantial amounts of the uncleaved IR precursor reached the Tris-phosphorylated, fully activated form in an insulin independent fashion. These results support the notion that PTP1B plays a crucial role in the control of the activity of the IR precursor during its biosynthesis.", "Plasma vaspin level is associated with IR and is significantly reduced following short-term CSII treatment.", "Quantification of CRBP-I\u2013positive cells ( Previous work has shown that the cGKI is strongly expressed in several brain regions that also contain high concentrations of the IR, such as the hypothalamus, cerebellum, and hippocampus ( To study the metabolic effects of cGKI deletion, conventional knockout mice are not useful because most of them die before 6 weeks of age as the result of smooth muscle dysfunction ( The impact of cGKI ablation on energy metabolism was examined in cGKI-SM mice and litter-matched control mice that were fed a standard diet. In skeletal muscle, intravenous injection of insulin led to a slightly stronger increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR in cGKI-SM mice than in control mice, but this difference did not reach statistical significance ( Insulin signaling in skeletal muscle ( In hepatic insulin resistance, liver-specific fetuin-A can be upregulated, leading to low-grade inflammation and hypoadiponectinemia ( In parallel to the impaired insulin action in the liver, a marked increase of IL-6 mRNA was observed in liver tissue of cGKI-SM mice ( IL-6 signaling in cGKI-SM (open bars) and control (black bars) mice. Extensive work has shown that IR signaling can be attenuated at the level of IR substrate (Irs) proteins by several serine kinases that are activated by obesity and inflammation, such as JNK, IKK, S6K1, and PKCs ( The current study shows that cGKI-SM mice have higher energy expenditure in the light phase than control mice. Moreover, insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR was not significantly altered in skeletal muscle of cGKI mutant mice. It is well known that stellate cells have a remarkable plasticity and are crucial for the control of liver homeostasis via paracrine interactions with other resident liver cells ( On the basis of our results, alternative mechanisms could also contribute to hepatic inflammation and impaired IR phosphorylation in cGKI-SM mice. The liver protein fetuin-A acts as a natural inhibitor of the IR tyrosine kinase ( The elevated IL-6 level might not only affect liver metabolism but also contribute to the development of other phenotypes that are observed in cGKI-SM mice.

Cells were exposed to 0\u20132000 cGy of IR delivered at low or high dose-rate with or without 6-hour exposure to 3-AP (1\u201310 \u03bcM) as indicated. Human radiation sensitizing Two-stage multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) statistics analyzed IR-drug interactions at all treatment levels (i.e., combinations) with all levels of every other treatment ( Exponentially-growing cells were plated on 100-mm dishes to yield 0.6\u20132.0\u00d710 A DNA polymerase extension assay quantified dCTP levels resulting from ribonucleotide reductase activity after IR with or without 3-AP ( Radiation dose-response curves are presented for CaSki cells ( To discover whether 3-AP hampered activity of RNR during conditions of continuous low-dose rate irradiation, cells had no treatment (0 cGy/hr) or were exposed to 5 \u03bcM 3-AP alone (0 cGy/hr) or IR (11, 23, 37, and 67 cGy/hr for 15 hours) with or without 5 \u03bcM 3-AP ( To explore RNR inhibition and cell cycle alteration after low and high-dose-rate irradiation, CaSki and C33-a cells treated with IR and/or 3-AP were analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry ( Cells exposed to IR sustain DNA damage in the form of base alterations, single-strand breaks, and double-strand breaks. In response to IR-mediated DNA damage, RNR increases its catalytic activity to increase available pools of dNTPs ( It is clear that the dose rate at which cells are exposed to radiation impacts the DNA damage response ( The iron-chelating RNR inhibitor 3-AP interferes with the diferric iron-stabilized free radical critical for catalytic function of RNR small subunits ( A G1-phase cell cycle checkpoint arrest as a result of inhibited RNR small subunits follows 3-AP treatment under low or high dose-rate radiation conditions ( Enhanced radiation sensitivity was expected and observed in cells treated with IR and 3-AP, due to the inhibition of RNR by 3-AP. This effect was most pronounced under conditions of low-dose-rate IR when demands for dNTPs are high resulting from repetitive DNA damage, but unable to be supplied by inactive RNR in the presence of 3-AP.", "Linear regression models with an interaction term ethnicity*BMI were used to evaluate whether ethnicity modifies the association between BMI and IR, CRP, and adiponectin. In both uni- and multivariate analyses, BMI was directly associated with IR and CRP and inversely with adiponectin across all ethnic groups. When compared with Chinese and Malays, Asian-Indians had higher IR and CRP and lower adiponectin levels. The increase in IR and CRP and the decrease in adiponectin for each unit increase in BMI were greater in Chinese than in other ethnic groups. The impact of BMI on IR, CRP, and adiponectin appears greater in Chinese as compared with other major Asian ethnic groups. Increasing levels of obesity are an important contributor to the increasing rates of type 2 diabetes and CVD ( Individuals from different ethnic groups show different levels of IR. This has led the World Health Organization to recommend that a BMI above 23 kg/m The pathophysiological impact of obesity extends beyond IR. In humans, adiponectin levels decrease with increasing levels of obesity, and several prospective studies have demonstrated that low adiponectin levels are associated with increased risk of CVD and type 2 diabetes ( What is unclear is whether the effects of ethnicity are direct, and independent of obesity, or whether ethnicity alters the relationship between obesity and IR. IR was assessed by the homeostasis model assessment. All statistical tests were two-sided, and a IR, CRP, and adiponectin were log-transformed to improve normality. The \u03c7 * \u2020 Correlation between ln-IR, ln-CRP, and ln-adiponectin with cardiovascular risk factors by sex Effects of ethnicity on the relationship between BMI and IR, CRP, and adiponectin are shown in Age-adjusted fitted regression plots showing relationships between BMI and IR, CRP, and adiponectin in Chinese (\u25cb), Malays (\u25b3), and Asian-Indians (\u25a1), stratified by sex. Based on our analysis of data from a large cross-sectional study, which included three major Asian ethnic groups (Chinese, Malays, and Asian-Indians) residing in Singapore, ethnic differences were observed for IR, CRP, and adiponectin. Some of these differences were independent of BMI, with greater IR, higher CRP, and lower adiponectin observed in Malays and Asian-Indians as compared with Chinese. However, the relationship between BMI and these parameters also differed between ethnic groups such that increases in BMI were associated with greater changes in all three parameters (IR, CRP, and adiponectin) in Chinese as compared with Malays and Asian-Indians. This is consistent with data from other studies that have shown that Malays and Asian-Indians exhibit higher rates of these disorders than Chinese ( In addition, we also observed that ethnicity modifies the relationship between BMI and IR, CRP, and adiponectin in a manner that is highly consistent across all three parameters. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) study, it was shown that that the relationship between BMI and CRP did not differ between white Americans, African Americans, and Hispanic Americans ( We considered several possible explanations as to why increasing levels of BMI were associated with greater increases in IR and CRP and greater decline in adiponectin in Chinese. Nevertheless, we believe that this is an important hypothesis generating study and provides some insight as to the rapid increase in the rates of type 2 diabetes in Chinese populations ( In conclusion, the relationships between BMI and three pathogenic pathways (IR, CRP, and adiponectin) are modified by ethnicity. The negative impact of increasing BMI on IR, CRP, and adiponectin levels is more pronounced in Chinese than the other ethnic groups.", "Following IR, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis were measured using flow cytometry, the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were measured, and the radiosensitizing effect of RNAi was observed. Down-regulation of Prx1 and/or Prx5 by RNAi does not alter the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, but made human tumor cells more sensitive to IR-induced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. When the two isoforms were decreased simultaneously, intracellular ROS and apoptosis significantly increased after IR. Silencing Prx1 and/or Prx5 by RNAi sensitizes human Eca-109 and TE-1 cells to IR, and the intracellular ROS accumulation may contribute to the radiosensitizing effect of the RNAi.", "We found that stimulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)R\u2013mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling was required for sCLU induction after IR exposure. Data from our laboratory suggested that p53 suppressed basal sCLU expression; however, sCLU was moderately induced after IR exposure, even though p53 was stabilized ( As IGF-1R signaling is activated by IR exposure ( As IGF-1 was induced in WT p53 cells after IR exposure even though p53 was stabilized, we investigated the mechanism of p53 suppression, and whether this changed after IR. Interrogation of the human To examine whether NF-Y alone could repress the To show that IGF-1 signaling was upstream of sCLU expression, cells were treated with AG1024, an IGF-1R tyrosine kinase inhibitor, before IR exposure. AG1024 blocked IR-induced As IGF-1R signaling was required for sCLU induction after IR exposure, we examined whether this pathway was activated after other forms of DNA damage. In RKO7 cells, induction of both the intracellular, ~60-kDa precursor sCLU (psCLU) and the ~80-kDa mature sCLU, appearing as an ~40-kDa smear, were noted after exposure to IR, H To determine whether DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were necessary for sCLU induction, cells were exposed to aphidicolin (Aph), a DNA polymerase \u03b1 inhibitor, before treatment with various DNA-damaging agents. Neither H2AX The requirement for ATM or ATR activation in IGF-1/sCLU expression was examined by pre-treating cells with the dual ATM and ATR kinase inhibitor (see To delineate between ATM and ATR, sCLU induction was examined in genetically defined, SV-40 immortalized AT fibroblasts (ATM The role of ATR signaling in IGF-1\u2013sCLU expression was examined by exposing ATM As p53 and NF-YA binding to the As ATM and ATM-activated proteins (for example, activated Chk2) phosphorylate p53 at serines 15 and 20 after IR exposure, we examined whether these post-translational modifications of p53 altered its ability to repress IGF-1 or sCLU. Our results integrate a novel signaling pathway, initiating from ATM, that activates the pro-survival IGF-1\u2013sCLU axis due to endogenous or exogenous DNA damage ( Several studies have suggested links between ATM, p53 and IGF-1 signaling, but this is the first report to show that p53, in conjunction with NF-YA, directly suppresses the NF-Y A\u2013C proteins bind p53 and suppress transcription of target genes involved in cell cycle regulation, such as Cdc2 and Chk2 ( As we uncovered a novel mechanism of p53/NF-YA-mediated suppression of IGF-1 transcription, we propose several possibilities for this loss of suppression after IR exposure, including post-translational modification of NF-YA and/or p53. Cdk2 can phosphorylate NF-YA, and mutation of these sites blocked its ability to bind DNA ( p53 null cells, or cells with p53 knockdown, induced IGF-1\u2013sCLU to a much greater extent after IR exposure compared with WT p53 cells. NF-Y is a known IR-activated transcription factor ( In conclusion, we elucidated the complete signaling pathway from DNA damage to sCLU expression. We also thank the support received from the SAIR NIH U24 grant CA126608 and the Imaging Shared Resource of the Simmons Cancer Center.", "In the case of IR, they were harvested 24 h after exposure to 4 Gy. T-lymphocytes generated from PBMC, as described above, were treated with nutlin (10 \u00b5M); doxorubicin (Doxo, 0.3 \u00b5g/mL); 5-fluorouracil (5FU, 300 \u00b5M); ionizing radiation (IR, 4Gy); DMSO (vehicle control) or left untreated (NT).", "The permeability of IR cells was assessed through transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and a paracellular tracer flux of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) with Ussing chambers. FGF-P is a promising mitigator that improves the proliferation and barrier function of keratinocytes after IR. p-ERK was examined by a cell-based ELISA 24 hours after IR, and the absorbance was measured on a SpectraMax M2 reader ( Protein samples were prepared from cultured keratinocytes and analyzed for claudin-1, -7, JAM-A, occludin, E-cadherin, and \u03b2-catenin (Invitrogen by Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) by Western blotting ( Eight-week-old male BALB/C mice from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) were used in the experiment. The right hind-legs of BALB/C mice were irradiated (50 Gy) with a strontium applicator (25.21 Gy/min) to create an IR \u03b2-burn on a 7 mm in diameter section of skin. After 16 days, pictures were taken to document the extent of healing in the IR skin area. IR damages the DNA, inhibits proliferation, and mediates apoptosis in the epidermis ( To determine if the In conclusion, the treatment of irradiated human keratinocytes with FGF-P enhances the barrier function and tight-junction protein production and improves cell proliferation This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication. After 16 days, pictures were taken to document the extent of healing in the IR-skin area.", "Insulin therapy restored IR levels to normalcy, whereas IGF-I-R and GLUT4 levels were only partially recovered.", "In the present study, we examined the molecules downstream of SAPK/C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), focusing on the role of retinoblastoma protein (Rb) during IR-induced MM cell apoptosis. The results demonstrate that IR activates SAPK/JNK, which associates with Rb both in vivo and in vitro. IR-activated SAPK/JNK phosphorylates Rb, and deletion of the phosphorylation site in the COOH terminus domain of Rb abrogates phosphorylation of Rb by SAPK/JNK. Taken together, our results suggest that Rb is a target protein of SAPK/JNK and that the association of SAPK/JNK and Rb mediates IR-induced apoptosis in MM cells.", "Persistent JNK activity in VS cells reduces cell death by suppressing accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) raising the possibility that JNK activity protects against IR-induced VS cell death, which is mediated by ROS. Histone 2AX phosphorylation, a marker of IR-induced DNA damage, was assayed by western blot and immunostaining. ROS levels were quantified by measuring 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H The JNK inhibitors, SP6000125 and I-JIP, reduced H2AX phosphorylation following IR. We recently evaluated the response of cultured human primary VS cells to increasing doses of IR and found that, compared to most neoplastic conditions, VS cells are relatively radioresistant c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of protein kinases that regulates a variety of cellular responses including cell death. VS cultures were labeled with 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H Seventy-two hours following IR, cultures were fixed and immunostained with anti-S100. H2AX becomes phosphorylated following double stranded breaks in DNA and is a sensitive indicator of IR-induced DNA damage. To further explore the effects of JNK activity on VS cell responses to IR, we analyzed the oxidative state of VS cells 2 h and 72 h following IR in the presence and absence of JNK inhibitors since IR has been shown to cause both an early and a late increase in ROS. We next assessed the ability of JNK signaling to protect cells from IR-induced cell death. The clonogenic assay represents the standard assay for IR-induced cell death. Seventy-two hours following IR, primary VS cultures were fixed and immunostained with anti-S100 antibodies followed by an Alexa 488 conjugated secondary antibody to specifically identify VS cells. The cultures were also labeled with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) which identifies apoptotic cells We next examined the influence of JNK signaling on VS cell responses to cytolethal doses of IR. Even though the sensitivity of VS cells to IR depends on their proliferation rate, several reports indicate that VSs in patients with NF2 are more likely to grow following SRS/FSR than sporadic VSs. Most radiosensitizing agents such as cis-platin or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) do not specifically target tumor cells and carry the potential of increasing IR-induced damage to normal, non-target tissues. H2AX becomes phosphorylated on serine 139 following double stranded DNA breaks, including those induced by IR. Taken together with recent studies, these results support a model whereby loss of merlin function leads to persistent JNK activity, which in turn suppresses VS cell apoptosis, including IR-induced apoptosis, likely by limiting oxidative stress. Further, for VSs treated with SRS/FRS, concurrent treatment with JNK inhibitors may augment IR-induced cytotoxicity and increase efficacy. Here we show that JNK activity in VS cells mediates IR-induced H2AX phosphorylation and reduces IR-induced oxidative stress and cell apoptosis.", "Insulin injection resulted in a significant increase in the phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 in AT of lean control mice ( Because macrophage accumulation in obese AT contributes to the development of IR ( Weight cycling does not modulate ATM content. AT expression of M1 ( Recent evidence indicates that, in addition to macrophages, T cells also accumulate in AT during obesity and contribute to the development of IR ( Weight cycling increases AT T-cell populations. Th1-polarized CD4 One of the distinguishing features of an adaptive immune response is the development of cellular memory against specific antigens ( Increased CD8 Multiple studies indicate that weight cycling is associated with worsened metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes ( Previous reports have shown that weight cycling increases systemic IR in rats ( In contrast to the above findings, other studies report no adverse effects of weight cycling ( It was important to confirm that weight loss completely reversed obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction before subsequent weight gain. These long-lived memory cells are capable of mounting a more rapid and potent secondary immune response upon re-exposure to the same antigen ( IR in AT is a key contributor to systemic glucose intolerance during obesity; however, other metabolic tissues also play a significant role in maintaining glucose homeostasis.", "The combination of nanoparticles with UV or IR is applicable, because it may be used for treatment or detection of local cancers, surface microbial infections and other skin diseases. Additionally, TG-coated nanoparticles were treated with UV and IR irradiation for 1h. In contrast, the combination of UV and IR with TG-coated nanoparticles led to higher LDH release and ROS generation with less cell viability, cell metabolic activity, and ATP level, in comparison with pristine nanoparticles.", "Fasting plasma glucose, body weight, food intake per 1 kg body weight, insulin and a homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were measured pre- and post-surgery. Our results revealed that IT improved both fasting plasma glucose levels and IR in GK rats by upregulating the expression of the TCF7L2 protein. The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was used to assess IR from fasting plasma glucose and plasma insulin levels as follows: HOMA-IR = fasting plasma glucose (mmol/l) x fasting insulin (mU/ml)/22.5. However, 30 min after the intragastric administration of glucose, the insulin levels in the GK-IT and GK-Sham groups were significantly lower than that of the WS-Sham group pre-surgery ( To investigate whether IT improves IR in GK rats, the HOMA-IR value was examined. Our results are consistent with those of Shu In conclusion, our study illustrated that IT efficiently down-regulates plasma glucose levels, improves IR, and increases postgavage insulin levels in T2DM. HOMA-IR changes before and after surgery in each group. HOMA-IR, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance.", "The purpose of this study was to determine the role of the DNA repair enzyme, human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase/apurinic/apyrimidinic lyase (hOGG1), on palmitate-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and IR in primary cultures of skeletal muscle derived from hind limb of ogg1(-/-) knockout mice and transgenic mice, which overexpress human (hOGG1) in mitochondria (transgenic [Tg]/MTS-hOGG1). Our results support the model that DNA repair enzyme OGG1 plays a pivotal role in repairing mtDNA damage, and consequently, in mtROS production and regulating downstream events leading to IR in skeletal muscle.", "Anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 568, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), IRDye 800CW, and IRDye 680 were obtained from Invitrogen (Eugene, OR), Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA), and LI-COR (Lincoln, NE), respectively. For fluorescence-based detection with the use of the Infrared Odyssey Imaging System (Li-Cor), after washes from the primary antibody, the membranes were incubated with IRDye-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted 1\u223610000 in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T. Therefore, for analyzing mTOR kinase activity, we tested the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein (rp) S6 (Ser 235/236; P-S6), an indirect mTOR target and a frequently used indicator of mTOR activity Quantitative Western blot analysis of phosphorylated rpS6 (P-S6) levels in the hippocampus and cortices in control (Ctr) animals ( ( ( ( ( It should be however noted that serines 235 and 236 of rpS6 can be phosphorylated by multiple kinases Upon closer inspection of P-S6 IR in the hippocampus at later time-points (e.g., 24 h post-KA treatment), its upregulation could be assigned to a large population of glial-like cells that were not stained at earlier time-points and in control brains ( ( In course of our experiments described above, we noticed different behavioral response to KA of animals pretreated for 4 weeks with rapamycin.", "The analysis of Athymic nude mice were injected with 2-3 \u00d7 10 Mice treated with KD + IR or KD + IR + carboplatin (12 Gy in 6 \u00d7 2 Gy fractions IR) demonstrated a significant decrease in tumor growth rate compared to mice treated with identical therapies on standard chow (p=0.0470 and p=0.0046 respectively) ( In order to replicate the duration and dosing of common human lung cancer fractionated radiation therapy protocols, mice bearing H292 xenografts fed a KD or control diet were treated with a total dose of 61.2 Gy in 34 \u00d7 1.8 Gy fractions ( Hypo-fractionated radiation therapy (delivering higher doses in fewer fractions) has become of increasing interest with the recognition of a potential improvement in the therapeutic ratio between the tumor volume and normal anatomic structures. In the conventional fractionation dosing scheme (61.2 Gy in 34 fractions with 1.8 Gy/fraction), significant increases in animal survival were achieved in the KD + IR group when compared to the IR alone treatment group ( In order to shorten the time required to be maintained on a KD, xenograft responses to hypofractionated radiotherapy were determined.", "Furthermore, the interplay between hMSH4 and eIF3f inhibits IR-induced AKT activation, and hMSH4 promotes eIF3f-mediated bypass of S phase arrest, and ultimately enhancing an early G2/M arrest in response to IR treatment. As shown in Figure To explore the potential role of hMSH4-eIF3f in cellular response to DNA damage, clonogenic survival and \u03b3-H2AX foci analyses were performed with IR-treated cells. Clonogenic survival analysis indicated that eIF3f-hMSH4 significantly increased cellular sensitivity to IR treatments (Figure To investigate whether the altered survival response is related to compromised DSB repair in eIF3f-hMSH4 cells, we next analyzed the retention of IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX foci \u2013 a surrogate indicator for compromised DSB repair [ It is known that the repair of IR-induced DSBs is largely dependent on NHEJ in mammalian cells [ To further authenticate the observed inhibitory effect of hMSH4 on NHEJ, we next utilized a NHEJ reporter cell line, 293T/#8-1, possessing a chromosomal NHEJ locus. As depicted in Figure In response to DNA damage, cells can activate several checkpoint mechanisms that are associated with different outcomes [ Since IR-triggered AKT phosphorylation/activation exerts a negative effect on G2/M checkpoint activation [ Understanding of DSB repair regulation in human cells is not only critical for revealing molecular events underlying genomic instability in cancer cells but also essential for devising more effective anti-cancer strategies. As a consequence, hMSH4-eIF3f prolongs the appearance of IR-triggered \u03b3-H2AX foci and compromises cell survival. Consistent with this, hMSH4 sustains \u03b3-H2AX foci and compromises cell survival in response to IR treatment.

The authors declare that they have no competing interests.", "It is well known the fact that IR is currently a valuable methodology to create variability in plants. IR can induce a large spectrum of damages and the irradiated cells have to counteract them by activating complex response pathways. The present miRNAs were predicted to target three putative helicase genes ( As DNA damage and ROS production are hallmarks for cell responses to IR, and environmental stresses in general, we investigated the changes in these parameters in rice seedlings and plantlets grown from \u03b3-irradiated seeds, both in the presence of water and NaCl as an osmotic agent. The cis-elements fond in the promoter sequence, along with their functions are listed in ( Radiological studies indicate that DNA is the principal target for the IR-induced biological effects. IR can also interact with atoms and molecules, particularly with water, to produce free radicals which are further diffused and interact with critical targets causing biological damage. Therefore, further specific studies are still required in order to better characterize the complex mechanisms activated in plants exposed to IR.", "Grb14 is recognized for its ability to potently bind the autophosphorylated IR and inhibit its activity on other substrates ( To determine whether the induction of Grb14 by FGFR4-R388 is involved in mediating the effects on increased insulin secretion, we used siRNA to target this adaptor protein. Forced downregulation of Grb14 in islet cells expressing FGFR4-R388 resulted in restoration of FGFR and IR signaling. Given the interruptive functions of Grb14 on IR in peripheral tissues ( To explore the impact of the FGFR4-R388 allele and its associated signaling dysregulation in vivo, we examined mice with knockin of the FGFR4-R385 allele. In contrast to the increased insulin production and enhanced glucose tolerance in FGFR4-R385 mice, islet IR-deleted mice ( Grb14 displays a restricted binding profile compared with the related Grb family members, Grb7 and Grb10 ( Relatively little is known about how Grb14 is regulated. In contrast, Grb7 and total IR are unchanged. FGFR4-R388 cells show increased IR phosphorylation. (B) Experiments were performed as in (A) with site-specific anti-phospho-IR antibodies. FGFR4-R388 cells show increased pY-IR 1158/1162 within the kinase pocket. In contrast, the IR juxtamembrane Y972 site shows diminished phosphorylation in response to glucose stimulation. Consistent with the diminished IR-Y972 phosphorylation at the IRS1 docking site, IRS1 levels are lower in FGFR4-R388 cells compared to FGFR4-G388 cells. Levels of IRS1 tyrosyl phosphorylation in response to glucose are also impaired in FGFR4-R388 cells. These cells were also examined in the absence (\u2212) or presence (+) of the proteasomal inhibitor LLnL, which restores IRS1 levels in FGFR4-R388 cells (right upper panel) and pervandate (right lower panel). The reciprocal effect of FGFR4-R388 on site-specific IR phosphorylation and diminished IRS1 is again noted. Pervanadate restores IRS1 in FGFR4-R388 cells to levels resembling those of FGFR4-G388 cells. Cells expressingFGFR4-G388, FGFR4-R388, or their empty vector pcDNA were transfected with siRNAtargeting the IR. The upper panel demonstrates the effectiveness of the siRNA (+) versus scrambled-sequence controls (\u2212) in downregulating the IR in each of the FGFR isotypes. The lower panel demonstrates the rise in insulin secretion in response to IR downregulation.", "To induce IR rats was fed with a high fat diet (HFD) during 8 weeks. Stimulated and non-stimulated salivary flow rate, total protein, as well as oxidative damage markers: 4-HNE protein adduct, 8-isoprostanes (8-isoP), 8-hydroxy-D-guanosine (8-OHdG), advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP), and protein carbonyls (PC) were determined in the plasma and submandibular and parotid glands of IR and control rats. We have shown a significant decrease (45%) of the stimulated salivary flow rate, and in the total protein concentration in the parotid (35%) and submandibular (10%) glands of HFD IR as compared to the control rats. The level of 4-HNE protein adduct (15%) and 8-isoP (20%) in the submandibular glands of IR rats as well as total level of 4-HNE protein adduct (39%), 8-isoP (27%), AOPP (25%), PC (32%), and 8-OHdG (18%) in the parotid glands of IR rats were significantly higher as compared to the control group. However, the redox balance in both glands shifted toward the oxidative status, parotid glands of IR rats are exposed to greater intensity OS. Stimulated secretory ability and mechanisms involved in the synthesis/secretion of proteins in the salivary glands are depressed in the course of IR. It has been shown that lipid peroxidation is the first, the most sensitive marker of oxidative damage which is related to the fact that lipids are very easily and immediately oxidized (Erel, They are many reports on the increased oxidative damage products in human or experimental animals plasma, liver, skeletal muscles, subcutanues, and viscelar adipose tissue in the course of the IR, type 2 diabetes and obesity (Keaney et al., This study is aimed at examining the OS level in the salivary glands of HFD induced insulin resistance and control rats by assessing the concentration of essential markers of oxidative damage as well as association between oxidatively modified cellular components and the secretory ability in the parotid and submandibular glands of rats in the course of HFD induced insulin resistance. The statistical significance was defined as Despite the fact that average daily food intake was similar in both groups, HFD-IR rats presented with a higher body weight when compared to the control rats ( C, control; HFD-IR, high fat diet insulin resistant rats; FFA, free fatty acids; HOMA-IR, HOMA index of insulin resistance; Finally, rats fed with HFD were characterized by an elevated plasma free fatty acids concentration as compared to the control rats ( Plasma 4-HNE-protein adduct, 8-isoP, 8-OHdG, AOPP and PC concentration of HFD-IR and control rats are given in Figure Our results showed that 8-week high fat feeding had only a minor effect on the unstimulated secretory ability of the salivary glands HFD-IR rats as compared to the control group, but significantly reduced the stimulated flow rate compared with the control group ( On the contrary, we observed that, high fat feeding influenced protein concentrations in both salivary glands. As shown in Table Submandibular glands 4-HNE-protein adduct, 8-isoP, 8-OHdG, AOPP and PC concentration of HFD-IR and control rats are presented on Figure Figure Comparison of parotid and submandibular glands OS biomarkers revealed quite different results within control and HFD-IR groups (Table In the high fat feeding group, acinar cells of both the submandibular and parotid glands demonstrated a degenerative changes in the form of vacuolation (Figure The Spearman correlation analysis showed that 4-HNE protein adduct ( Salivary glands are responsible for maintaining oral cavity homeostasis. It is well documented that diabetes mellitus, obesity and IR alter the antioxidants function of salivary glands (Nogueira et al., Evidence showed that chronic high fat feeding induces obesity, IR (Ebertz et al., The control of ROS stationary level is the result of a balance between their production and their elimination. Our study showed that both parotid and submandibular glands of HFD-IR rats had impaired ability to maintain normal redox balance compared to the data obtained in the salivary glands of the insulin-sensitive control rats, resulting in a significant increase in the level of oxidized biomolecules in comparison to the salivary glands from control group. However, a greater percentage increase in the concentration of lipid oxidation products (parotid gland (4-HNE protein adduct \u219139%, 8-isoP \u219127%) vs. submandibular gland (4-HNE protein adduct \u219115%, 8-isoP \u219120%), as well as new types of oxidatively modified components (AOPP \u219125, PC \u219132, and 8-OHdG \u219118%) in the parotid glands of HFD-IR rats as compared to the control proved that parotid glands are subjected to more intense OS, or they are more susceptible than submandibular glands to oxidant attack generated in the course of HFD induced IR. We observed that mechanisms involved in the synthesis/secretion of proteins are affected in the parotid and submandibular glands of IR rats, however only stimulated secretory ability in the salivary glands is depressed in the course of HFD-induced insulin resistance. Moreover, we noted that the oxidative/antioxidative balance in both glands of IR rats shifted toward the oxidative status; however the parotid glands are exposed to a greater intensity oxidative stress. IR is a prediabetic state, so one can see that salivary glands dysfunction manifests early in diabetes progression and it is detectable in prediabetic state. So IR should be taken seriously by the dentists, because at this stage diabetes can adversely affect the health of the oral cavity.", "In this study, we revealed that IR injury significantly activated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy in a middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model. Pre-ischemia melatonin treatment was able to attenuate IR-induced ER stress and autophagy. In addition, with tandem RFP-GFP-LC3 adeno-associated virus, we demonstrated pre-ischemic melatonin significantly alleviated IR-induced autophagic flux. Furthermore, we showed that IR induced neuronal apoptosis through ER stress related signalings. Moreover, IR-induced autophagy was significantly blocked by ER stress inhibitor (4-PBA), as well as ER-related signaling inhibitors (PERK inhibitor, GSK; IRE1 inhibitor, 3,5-dibromosalicylaldehyde). In summary, our study provides strong evidence that pre-ischemia melatonin administration significantly protects against cerebral IR injury through inhibiting ER stress-dependent autophagy.", "Group 1 (Diabetic control; n = 10): Diabetic rats were administered 0.5% DMSO (2 ml/kg/day; i.p) for 28 days and on 28 The myocardial IR injury was performed according to the previous procedure (Suchal Heart tissue was removed from liquid nitrogen and homogenised with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). However, mangiferin treatment to diabetic rats significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the blood glucose level as compared to diabetes + IR and diabetic control groups ( As shown in As anticipated, IR insult to the diabetic rats caused significant depletion of antioxidants such as GSH (P < 0.001), SOD (P < 0.05) and CAT (P < 0.01). Similarly, there was increase in the level of MDA (P < 0.001), a marker of lipid peroxidation, in diabetic-IR rats as compared to diabetic control. Furthermore, IR injury disrupted the membrane and caused release of necroenzymes from the myocardium as evident from increased serum level of CK-MB (P < 0.001) and LDH (P < 0.001) in diabetes + IR group. Intriguingly, mangiferin treatment for 28 days significantly bolstered the antioxidant status, reduced MDA level and prevented release of cardiac injury marker after IR injury in diabetic rats ( The histopathological sections of rat hearts in the diabetes + IR group showed marked myonecrosis, edema and inflammation along with higher histological score. In mangiferin treatment group, the myocardium appeared normal with less necrosis, edema and inflammation ( In line with the histopathological results, the ultrastructural evaluation of myocardium of diabetic-IR rats revealed extensive myofibrillar degeneration, swelling and irregular mitochondria with disorganized cristae. On the other hand, in the mangiferin treatment group, the myofibres had intact bands and normal mitochondria with well preserved cristae ( IHC and TUNEL assay were performed to evaluate the effect of mangiferin on myocardial apoptosis induced by IR injury in diabetic rats. In the diabetes + IR rat hearts, there was increased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Caspase-3) and decreased expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. In addition, there was increased number of TUNEL positive cell in diabetes + IR group in comparison to diabetic control group. Furthermore, less number of TUNEL positive cells were present in the mangiferin treated group ( In diabetes + IR group, there was increased number of CD-45 positive cells indicating the presence of inflammatory cells in the myocardium. Furthermore, there was increased expression of NF-\u03baBp65, a transcription factor and serum TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels in diabetes + IR group as compared to diabetic control group (P < 0.001). Interestingly, mangiferin treatment significantly reduced inflammation as there was decreased level of inflammatory markers as compared to diabetes + IR rats ( There was increased expression of AGE-RAGE in the diabetic groups. Administration of mangiferin to diabetic rats significantly (P < 0.01) attenuated the formation of AGE and subsequently decreased the expression of AGE-RAGE in comparison to diabetes + IR group ( Since, mangiferin strengthened the antioxidant system, attenuated myocardial apoptosis and inflammation, we further explored whether it acts through modulation of MAPK pathway as this signaling pathway is activated by reactive oxygen species. ERK1/2 in diabetic-IR group as compared to diabetic control group. Treatment with mangiferin significantly normalized this pathway as there was increased ERK1/2 and decreased p38 and JNK expression in the myocardium ( In the present study, we demonstrated that mangiferin improved cardiac function, inhibited oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in IR challenged diabetic myocardium. It has been shown that AGEs production increased in the hyperglycemic state and its accumulation is responsible for worsening of IR injury in diabetics Previous studies have reported that binding of AGE to its cell surface receptor RAGE resulted in NF-\u03baB mediated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines Furthermore, an association has been found in increased AGE-RAGE axis and MAPK pathway In conclusion, results from our study established that, treatment with mangiferin favourably modulated AGE-RAGE/MAPK pathways which further prevented oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in the IR-induced myocardial injury in diabetic rats.

DSBs were introduced, and cell cycle checkpoints were recruited after exposure to IR in nasopharyngeal carcinoma SUNE-1 cells. DNA-PKcs is recruited to the DSB site and binds to the Ku70/80 heterodimer to form the DNA repair complex, which activates the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs through phosphorylation of the serine/threonine [ Studies have suggested a connection between reduced levels of ATM and alleviated levels of DNA-PKcs, which may rely on downstream substrates after exposure to IR [ There are comprehensive links among DNA repair, cell cycle progression and genome integrity in different cell lines. We used a DNA-PK inhibitor to explore the synergistic effect on inhibition of DSB repair following IR exposure in NHEJ-competent or -deficient cells and a cancer cell line from a nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patient. To investigate the role of DNA-PKcs in response to IR, we used mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF), DNA-PKcs ( NU7441, a specific DNA-PK inhibitor, was used to investigate any synergistic effect when combined with irradiation in MEF, DNA-PKcs DNA-PKcs participates in multiple aspects of the NHEJ process in DSB repair [ \u03b3H2AX foci were formed immediately after 5 Gy X-ray and the resolution of it delayed in NHEJ repair-deficient cells. Studies have shown overlaps between phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs and \u03b3H2AX foci and phosphorylation of ATR and \u03b3H2AX foci [ MEF cells with knockdown of DNA-PKcs and Ku70 were irradiated with 5 Gy X-ray and co-immunofluorescence stained with \u03b3H2AX antibody and p-ATM (Ser1987) antibody ( To identify whether cell cycle arrest is biologically relevant to radiosensitivity, we performed a radiation-induced cell cycle profile of MEF, DNA-PKcs Cell cycle distribution in asynchronous MEF ( To further examine the effect of DNA-PKcs inactivation on wild-type cells, we co-treated MEF cells with IR at 5 Gy and 2 \u03bcM NU7441. The population in G2/M phase was 23.8%, 24.4%, and 11.0% treated with IR alone at 8, 16, and 24 h post-IR; whereas a remarkable and permanent increase of 19.5%, 39.5%, and 35.7% in G2/M phase was detected with the combination of IR and NU7441 treatment at 8, 16, and 24 h post-IR, respectively (Figure ( The expression of ATM is activated by IR-induced DSBs and phosphorylates CHK2, which in turn triggers the G1 checkpoint [ Irradiation at 5 Gy up-regulated cell cycle checkpoint signaling in MEF ( Akt is a downstream protein of PI3K in DDR and modulates G1/S and G2/M transitions [ ATR and its downstream effector CHK1 are hallmark mediators of intra-S phase and G2/M checkpoints, which collaborate to stabilize DSB and promote DNA repair [ ATR\u2013CHK1 pathway proteins were activated post-IR (5 Gy) in MEF ( Radiotherapy is currently the standard of treatment for NPC. Therefore, we studied SUNE-1 cells to test whether inactivation of DNA-PKcs sensitizes human NPC cells to IR. DSBs were completely repaired until 24 h, and the kinetics in disappearance of \u03b3H2AX foci was observed to be similar by normalizing the quantified nuclear foci (Figure To investigate the role of cell cycle checkpoints in SUNE-1 cells after exposure to IR and the mechanism of DNA-PKcs-mediated radiosensitivity, we conducted a western blot analysis to examine the gene expression of the ATM\u2013CHK2 and ATR\u2013CHK1 signaling pathways. We found that the level of phospho-CHK2 reached a maximum at 15 min and fell to normal at 3 h post-IR which was accompanied by activation of ATM. Phosphorylation of ATR and phosphorylation of CHK1 persisted to 12 h post-IR (Figure We have found that a mechanism of DNA-PKcs activation mediated by cell cycle checkpoints is required for initiating the NHEJ repair pathway in response to irradiation. A total of 1.5 \u00d7 10 Total protein and phosphorylated protein following IR were analyzed by Western blotting. For the foci assay, cells were seeded on coverslips (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for more than 24 h and exposed to IR at 5 Gy.", "", "The objective of the present study was to evaluate the association between IR, plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the kinetics of TG-rich lipoprotein (TRL) containing apolipoprotein (apo) B-48 in a large sample of insulin sensitive (IS) and IR men. IR subjects (n=91) were characterized by fasting TG levels \u22651.5mmol/L and an index of homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR)\u22652.5 or type 2 diabetes, while IS subjects (n=24) were characterized by an HOMA-IR index <2.5 and TG levels <1.5mmol/L. IR subjects had higher TRL apoB-48 production rate (+202%; P<0.0001) and CRP levels (+51%; P=0.01) than IS subjects. TRL apoB-48 production rate and CRP levels were inversely correlated in IR subjects (r=-0.32; P=0.002). IR subjects with CRP levels above the median (2.20mg/L) had lower TRL apoB-48 production rate than IR subjects with CRP levels below the median (\u0394=-24%; P<0.05). Our results confirm that IR is associated with increased TRL apoB-48 secretion and suggest that a higher inflammatory status is associated with decreased TRL apoB-48 secretion among IR subjects.", "We treated HCT116, HKh\u20102, and HKe\u20103 lines with 6\u2010Gy of IR, and assessed RAD51 foci formation after 6 h, as a surrogate for HRR efficiency.", "IR is able to regulate several genes and factors involved in cell-cycle progression, survival and/or cell death, DNA repair and inflammation modulating an intracellular radiation-dependent response. In this review, we report how IR could stimulate inflammatory factors to affect cell fate via multiple pathways, describing their roles on gene expression regulation, fibrosis and invasive processes. Understanding the complex relationship between IR, inflammation and immune responses in cancer, opens up new avenues for radiation research and therapy in order to optimize and personalize radiation therapy treatment for each patient. apoptosis, necrosis, mitotic catastrophe, autophagy and senescence) [ The aim of this review is to describe how IR may stimulate immunological factors to determine cell fate by multiple pathways by providing an overview of the main key transcription factors that modulate inflammatory gene expression profile after IR exposure. In mammalian cells, IR can elicit a multi-layered signalling response by activating many pro-survival pathways that converge to transiently activate key transcription factors (TFs). demonstrated that IL-6 up regulation was positively linked to radiation resistance while its inhibition enhanced the radiation sensitivity in prostate cancer cells [ On the other hand, the inflammation response down-regulation is partly due to the short half-life of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and to the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, and TGF-\u03b2 [ To date, a few studies have evaluated the cytokine production by cancer cells exposed to high or fractionated dose of IR. In particular, after TARGIT treatment, they observed that various proteins including IL-6, MCP-1 and IL-8, and STAT3-drived pathways involved in controlling tumour cell growth and motility, were deregulated [ Cytokines can influence the dose-dependent IR response by their pleiotropic effects, modulating inflammation, invasiveness and fibrosis. As demonstrated in previous studies, radiation therapy could ultimately culminate in fibrosis [ The IR induced fibrotic tissue remodelling is a multi-cellular process regulated by different cytokines such as TGF-\u03b21, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-4 and IL-13; chemokines such as MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b2; angiogenic and growth factors [ There is substantial evidence that TGF-\u03b21 is primarily involved in normal tissue injury and plays a critical role in the initiation, development, and persistence of radiation induced fibrosis [ Moreover, the fibroblasts activation into myofibroblasts is another key step in radiation fibrosis where these cells play an active role in the synthesis and remodelling of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including collagens. demonstrated that BC patients showing high plasma TGF-\u03b21 levels have a major risk of developing post-radiotherapy fibrosis, suggesting its predictive role in IR tumour response [ There is some evidence that the IL-4 and IL-13 Th2 cytokines, cooperate with TGF-\u03b2 to induce fibrosis [ Finally, even the IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 pro-inflammatory cytokines have been implicated in fibrosis development. IL-1\u03b2 is directly up-regulated by radiation and it is known to activate other inflammation-related molecules such as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a group of zinc-dependent enzymes that regulate or degrade ECM components [ Inflammatory IR response can favour cancer cells invasion, providing a favorable environment for tumour promotion and metastasis [ The radiation ability to increase cancer cell invasiveness has been reported for BC, pancreatic, rectal and colon cancer cells [ Both IL-8 and IL-6 are involved in IR inflammatory response, enhancing cancer cell invasiveness [ IL-8 is a member of the CXC chemokines superfamily and has a wide range of pro-inflammatory effects. It was initially described as a neutrophil and lymphocyte chemo-attractant [ IL-6 is one of the most important pro-inflammatory cytokine but it has also been considered to have an anti-inflammatory role for its ability to induce IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 antagonists [ In addition, the IR induced IL-1\u03b2 expression can also favour cancer cell invasion. This is based on the principle that stand-alone, chemo or radio-therapeutic regimens are generally unable to control neoplastic lesions, whereas combining therapeutic agents with dissimilar action mechanisms potentially results in synergistic anti-neoplastic effects [ IR leads to the activation of several immunological proteins and TFs modulating the expression of numerous immune mediators that may promote cancer development. Thus, targeting the IR induced inflammatory signalling pathways offers the opportunity to improve the radiation therapy clinical outcomes by enhancing radiosensitivity [ For example, as described in literature, the disruption of NF-kB signalling could be associated to conventional cancer therapies in order to increase their efficiency [ Radiation is also known to induce inflammation through COX-2. COX is the key enzyme required for the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins [ In mammalian cells, IR can elicit the activation of multiple targets and key TFs, including the above mentioned STAT3, representing a promising therapeutic target for preventing inflammation-mediated cancers [ In addition, the previously mentioned cytokines IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, IL-6 or TGF-\u03b2 can influence the response to IR, inducing inflammation, cancer cells invasiveness and fibrosis in irradiated tissues, encouraging the hypothesis of the use of specific inhibitors or drugs able to manipulate cytokine pathways, in order to improve radiation research and therapy. However, some evidence suggests that high single doses used in IORT may produce different effects from those seen after conventional fraction sizes [ Few papers describe the role of inflammatory response to high doses of IR, such as those used in IORT treatments, rendering in this field the necessity of being explored and clarified. Some evidence suggests that high single-dose regimens are more efficient than low-dose regimens to trigger both innate and adaptive anti tumour immunity [ In order to highlight the molecular mechanisms involved in the response/resistance to IORT treatment, our research group is performing the study of IR effects on BC cells subjected to high dose treatment modalities and their correlation with genetic background and molecular gene expression. IR activates complex cross-linked intracellular pathways able to define cell fate, determining the outcome between survival and death regulating several factors involved in inflammation, DNA repair, cell survival or death (summarized in Figure The authors declare that they have no competing interests. This work was supported by FIRB/MERIT (RBNE089KHH).", "Recent studies of atomic bomb survivors suggest that persons exposed early in life have a very high risk of thyroid cancer, but the risk decreases with attained age [ Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is the primary detector of DNA damage due to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) after exposure to IR. Immunofluorescent staining of p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) in non-irradiated (control) and irradiated 4W, 7W and 8M thyroid follicular epithelial cells ( \u00d7 1000 magnification) Western blots were performed to determine the effect of IR on the abundance of DNA damage response proteins in the thyroid and thymus (positive control); amounts of protein were quantified via densitometry. The DNA damage response that occurs following IR (e.g. Ryan suggested that p53 activates a spectrum of target genes that positively regulate autophagy [ It has been suggested that excess or prolonged autophagy can promote an alternative mechanism leading to programmed cell death, which is particularly relevant in cancers defective in apoptosis [ The hypersensitivity of thyroid glands in children to radiation-induced cancers may be due to p53 dysfunction and defective apoptosis, despite high proliferative activity in immature thyroid follicular epithelial cells after exposure to IR. Because IR induced autophagy in immature, but not adult, rat thyroids, we suggest that autophagy may be a marker of the DNA damage response to irradiation in immature thyroids.", "The aim of this study was to explore the effects of linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), on palmitic acid (PA)-induced inflammatory responses and IR in C2C12 myotubes. Our data demonstrated that these three test 18-carbon PUFAs can inhibit PA-induced interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and IR as evidenced by increases in phosphorylated AKT and the 160-kD AKT substrate, mRNA and plasma membrane protein expression of glucose transporter 4, and glucose uptake. The 18-carbon PUFAs did not reverse PA-induced inflammation or IR in C2C12 myotubes transfected with a constitutively active mutant I\u03baB kinase-\u03b2 plasmid, which suggests the importance of the inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation by the 18-carbon PUFAs. Moreover, blockade of AMPK activation by short hairpin RNA annulled the inhibitory effects of the 18-carbon PUFAs on PA-induced IR but not inflammation. Our findings suggest that the 18-carbon PUFAs may be useful in the management of PA-induced inflammation and IR in myotubes.", "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of TC on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiation and genes related to differentiation and IR. [ Now the treatments of T2DM mainly focus on improving IR. The most effective drugs which improve IR are thiazolidinedione (TZDs), such as rosiglitazone, pioglitazone and so on. A paired-samples To assess cytotoxic effect of TC, cell viability in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes was evaluated using MTT assay [ The effect of TC from Now, adipose tissue is recognized as not only an energy-storage tissue but also an endocrine tissue that secretes a variety of bioactive substances to participate in the occurrence and development of IR and obesity. The values are expressed as means \u00b1 SD ( T2DM is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia, IR and \u03b2-cell dysfunction, leading to macro- and micro-vascular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and sexual dysfunction.", "Sensitizing cancer cells specifically to IR would improve tumor control and decrease normal tissue toxicity. MMAE sensitized colorectal and pancreatic cancer cells to IR in a schedule and dose dependent manner correlating with mitotic arrest. MMAE in combination with IR resulted in increased DNA damage signaling and activation of CHK1. To test a therapeutic strategy of MMAE and IR, PANC-1 or HCT-116 murine tumor xenografts were treated with non-targeted free MMAE or tumor targeted MMAE (ACPP-cRGD-MMAE). While free MMAE in combination with IR resulted in tumor growth delay, tumor targeted ACPP-cRGD-MMAE with IR produced a more robust and significantly prolonged tumor regression in xenograft models. In randomized clinical trials, concurrent chemotherapy-radiotherapy has demonstrated improved local tumor control and overall survival, including gastrointestinal tumors ( Cell sensitivity to IR varies throughout the cell cycle with G To evaluate the ability of targeted MMAE tumor delivery to radiosensitize tumors we used activatable cell penetrating peptide (ACPP) technology. ACPP can function as tumor targeted delivery vehicles ( Here we evaluated the ability of MMAE to radiosensitize tumor cells and to be targeted to tumor xenografts in combination with IR. Following IR, cells were re-plated in drug free media. Cells were harvested 15 minutes post IR, underwent neutral electrophoresis (Trevigen). Two hours post IR, cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained with antibody to \u03b3H2Ax. MMAE and IR treated cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). 6-8 week old female athymic nu/nu mice (UCSD Animal Care Program) were injected subcutaneously into thighs with 5\u00d710 Mice were treated with IR or intravenous (IV) injection of ACPP-cRGD-MMAE, tumor tissue was harvested, formalin fixed and paraffin embedded followed by staining with indicated antibodies (Ventana Medical Systems). One day post IR, mice were anesthetized (1:1 mixture of 100 mg/ml of ketamine and 5 mg/ml of midazolam) and IV injected with either fluorescently labeled ratiometric ACPP (Cy5 and Cy7) or ACPP-cRGD-MMAE (Cy5). For HCT-116, the IC Since MMAE blocks cells in the radiosensitive G Next we evaluated if 24 hour exposure to MMAE increased IR induced DNA breaks in a dose dependent manner. In irradiated HCT-116 cells, treating with 1 nM MMAE did not increase DNA damage over IR alone. However, 5 nM MMAE resulted in a significant increase in IR induced DNA double-stranded breaks. These results are concordant with dose response effects of MMAE on cell cycle in HCT-116 cells, where 1 nM of MMAE did not alter the cell cycle profile but 5 nM did ( Since MMAE increased IR induced DNA double strand breaks, we determined if MMAE decreased survival in irradiated cells. In HCT116 cells, the IC The primary mode of cell death following IR is mitotic catastrophe. Based on the cell cycle dose response to MMAE from Since MMAE reduced clonogenic cell survival following IR, we tested if MMAE increased apoptosis in irradiated cells. HCT-116 cells were treated with MMAE for 24 hrs followed by IR. Cells were collected 24 hrs post IR and the sub G1 population (apoptotic) was measured. We first validated that MMAE conjugated to the polycationic cell penetrating peptide (r We then evaluated the efficacy of combined MMAE with focal IR to inhibit tumor xenograft growth. First, we tested the hypothesis that MMAE tumor targeted delivery would increase tumor regression compared to free MMAE delivery ( We extended our studies on ACPP-cRGD-MMAE and IR by increasing the dosing schedule to see if it would result in further improvement in long term regression. Fractionated IR of 3 Gy per day was administered on day 1, 2, and 3. Again on days when ACPP-cRGD-MMAE and IR were both given, IR was delivered in the morning and ACPP-cRGD-MMAE in the afternoon. As we observed in We then tested a modified treatment schedule of ACPP-cRGD-MMAE and IR using HCT-116 tumor xenografts. HCT-116 tumors were grown to mean tumor volume of > 270 mm In these series of studies we have identified that MMAE can radiosensitize tumor cells and enhance tumor xenograft regression in combination with IR. Moreover, we tested a therapeutic paradigm whereby a potent radiosensitizer such as MMAE can be selectively delivered to tumors using activatable cell penetrating peptides to increase tumor response to IR ( MMAE has previously been shown to have single agent anti-tumor efficacy against a broad panel of tumor histologies when appropriately delivered ( While MMAE is a potent radiosensitizer ACPP conjugated delivery of radiosensitizers is innovative and of clinical significance in that it offers a solution to the problem of non-selective radiosensitization of molecules for not only cancer cells but also surrounding normal tissue. IR results in changes in the tumor microenvironment including alterations of tumor permeability and retention, gene expression, tumor cell surface receptor expression and protease activity. The physics of IR allows for IR to be specifically deposited to tumor tissue and can allow it to serve as beaconing mechanism for systemically delivered therapeutic agents. Such a concept has been seen with combining IR with oncolytic viruses, where IR enhances the ability of both intratumoral and systemically delivered oncolytic viruses to replicate in irradiated tumor microenvironment ( An alternative explanation for the enhanced accumulation of ACPP within irradiated tumors as opposed to non-irradiated tumors is the concept of enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) of systemically delivered macromolecular agents of \u226540 KDa ( The authors thank Joseph Aguilera, Evangeline Mose, Dawn Jaquish, Randy French and Donald P.

Sustained tumor growth inhibition following treatment with ACPP-cRGD-MMAE and IR.", "The results of different studies indicate that tumor proliferation and survival is dependent on the IGF1R and IR, and that their inhibition leads to reductions in proliferation and increases in cell death. Molecular targeting therapies that have been used in solid tumors include anti-IGF1R antibodies, anti-IGF1/IGF2 antibodies, and small molecule inhibitors that suppress IGF1R and IR kinase activity. Novel aspects of IGF1R/IR in cancer, such as biased agonism, integrin \u03b23 signaling, AHR, and new therapeutic targeting strategies will be discussed. The early evidence linking the IGF1R to cancer was the finding that the transformation of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) by many, but not all, tested oncogenes requires an intact Liver specific Canonical signaling responses to insulin/IGFs have been reviewed ( Mice that express a dominant negative IGF1R in skeletal muscle (MRK mice) are insulin resistant and exhibit hyperinsulinemia ( Obesity increases the risk for several cancers including breast cancer ( The aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( Considering the roles of IGF/IGF1R in transformation, tumor growth, and resistance to cell death, anti-IGF1R antibodies were designed for cancer therapy ( IGF1 is a balanced IGF1R agonist that induces beta arrestin 1 (\u03b2-arr1) and IGF1R kinase signaling pathways ( Shin and colleagues in 2013 tested the effectiveness of the anti-IGF1R antibody cixutumumab (cix) on a panel of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines ( MEDI-573 is a human antibody that selectively targets IGF1 and IGF2, but not insulin ( OSI-906 is a small molecule IGF1R/IR kinase inhibitor that suppresses the growth of tumor xenografts in mice ( From all apparent evidences, we propose that the insulin/IGF system is still an effective target for cancer therapy.", "Systemic and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity together with expressions of several genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis and skeletal muscle SIRT1, SIRT3 protein levels were studied in rats fed a normal diet, a HFD, and a HFD with intervention of RES for 8 weeks. HFD fed rats exhibited obvious systemic and skeletal muscle IR as well as decreased SIRT1 and SIRT3 expressions, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and mitochondrial biogenesis (p < 0.05). By contrast, RES treatment protected rats against diet induced IR, increased SIRT1 and SIRT3 expressions, mtDNA, and mitochondrial biogenesis (p < 0.05). This study suggests that RES ameliorates insulin sensitivity consistent with improved SIRT3 expressions and rebalance between SS mitochondrial oxidative stress and antioxidant competence in HFD rats.", "In current study, we investigated whether TZDs improve endothelial IR induced by high glucose concentration or hyperglycemia via a non-canonical PPAR\u03b3-dependent nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) trans-repression pathway. Our results showed that pre-treatment with TZDs dramatically decrease the susceptibility of endothelial cell to IR, while post-treatment notably improve the endothelial IR both in vitro and in vivo. These findings highlighted a non-canonical mechanism for TZDs to ameliorate endothelial IR which might provide a potential strategy to prevent and treat the diabetic vascular complications clinically.", "The present study aimed to investigate whether IL-18BP had a protective role in remote organ hepatic IR injury. Group III (IR + IL-18BP): 75 \u00b5g/kg of IL-18BP in 0.9% saline (1 mL) was administered 30 minutes before infrarenal AA dissection and clamping; 30 minutes of ischemia was applied and then was exposed to 90 minutes of reperfusion. Serum AST, ALT, and LDH levels were remarkably higher in IR group and returned to normal levels in treatment group. The proinflammatory cytokine levels had decreased in treatment group, and was statistically significant compared with the IR group. This study suggested that IL-18BP has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects in cases of IR with infrarenal AA induced liver oxidative damage. Group III (IR + IL-18BP, n=7): 75 \u00b5g/kg of IL-18BP in 0.9% saline (1 mL) was administered intraperitoneally 30 minutes before infrarenal AA dissection and clamping, followed by 30 minutes of applied ischemia and then exposed to 90 minutes of reperfusion. The blood level of AST was found to be 177.3 U/L (range, 153.7-195.9 U/L) in the sham group, 555.3 U/L (355.3-747 U/L) in the IR group, and 353.3 U/L (226.4-637 U/L) in the IL-18BP group. There was a statistically significant difference between the IR group and sham group, and the IL-18BP group and IR group (P = 0.00). The blood level of ALT was found to be 50.2 U/L (36.9-69.2 U/L) in the sham group, 114.9 U/L (63.9-182.3 U/L) in the IR group, and 66.1 U/L (58.8-78.5 U/L) in the IL-18BP group. There was a statistically significant difference between the IR group and sham group, and the IL-18BP group and IR group (P = 0.03). The blood level of LDH was 2,436.85 \u00b1 707.1 U/L in the sham group, 3,423 \u00b1 410.9 UL in the IR group, and 2,928.57 \u00b1 755.32 U/L in the IL-18BP group. There was a statistically significant difference between the IR group and sham group (P = 0.034). The blood and statistical analysis results of the groups are summarized in The blood level of IL-6 was 99.92 \u00b1 2.32 pg/mL in the sham group, 107.86 \u00b1 4.76 pg/mL in the IR group, and 100.29 \u00b1 6.1 pg/mL in the IR + IL-18BP group. There was a statistically significant reduction in IL-6 levels between the IL-18BP treatment group and the IR group (P = 0.008). The blood level of IL-1\u03b2 was found to be 39.93 \u00b1 4.24 pg/mL in the sham group, 47.72 \u00b1 7.63 pg/mL in the IR group, and 43.65 \u00b1 3.90 pg/mL in the IR + IL-18BP treatment group. The blood level of IL-18 was 170.73 \u00b1 6.82 pg/mL in the sham group, 190.3 \u00b1 14.3 pg/mL in the IR group, and 175.87 \u00b1 8.19 pg/mL in the IR + IL-18BP group. There was a statistically significant reduction in IL-18 levels between the IL-18BP treatment group and the IR group (P = 0.006). The blood level of TNF-\u03b1 was 130.94 \u00b1 6.57 pg/mL in the sham group, 142.74 \u00b1 6.92 pg/mL in the IR group, and 133.67 \u00b1 5.33 pg/mL in the IR + IL-18BP group. The blood level of IFN-\u03b3 was 58.66 \u00b1 5.23 pg/mL in the sham group, 78.61 \u00b1 8.35 pg/mL in the IR group and 64.98 \u00b1 6.58 pg/mL in the IR + IL-18BP group. The reduction in the IFN-\u03b3 level with the treatment in IR + IL-18BP group was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The relations among the groups regarding the blood levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 are summarized in The TOC data were considerably higher (7.85 [7.08-8.42]) in the IR group compared to the other groups; however, it was significantly reduced (4.95 [4.45-5.92]) in the IR + IL-18BP group. The TAC results were similar among the groups; however, the OSI value was statistically significantly reduced in IR + IL-18BP group (439.03 \u00b1 165.5) compared to the IR group (695.28 \u00b1 139.02) (P = 0.008). The TOC, TAC, and OSI data, and the statistical analysis results are summarized in Morphological change and H-Score results were given in To the best of our knowledge, the protective effect of IL18-BP in hepatic IR injury following infrarenal aortic occlusion model of rats has not been studied. In the present study, we showed that hepatic IR injury, which can be developed during aortic surgery, was reduced partially by IL18-BP. IL18-BP ameliorated the disorders of hepatic functions and decreased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-18 related to infra-aortic IR injury. At the same time, IL18-BP reduced the serum levels of OSI in the liver of infra-aortic occlusive rats and also ameliorated histopathological disorders induced by IR injury compared to sham group. The hepatic IR injury, which is a complex procedure involving intracellular pathophysiological signal pathways, cytokines, and mediators, is based on free oxygen radical (FOR) derivatives that occur due to the molecular oxygen inflow to the cell during the period of reperfusion, where the blood supply is restored upon the depletion of energy storages and deposition of toxic metabolites as a result of insufficient perfusion of the cells during ischemia [ The increased inflammatory response in IR injuries leads to an increase in TOS. In this context, this is the first study evaluating the favorable effect of melatonin on IR-exposed liver injury after infrarenal occlusion of the aorta with our ischemic reperfusion (30-120 minutes) period. We supposed that our results will put forward a new point of view to the literature about protective, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect of IL-18BP on liver functions of IR after infra-renal aortic occlusions.

HOMA-IR (median, 1.3 HOMA-IR in HDpts does not differ from the control group. In HDpts leptin and resistin do not influence IR. A major role is attributed to the function of adipose tissue, especially visceral [ The aim of this study was to measure the impact of the factors that may influence homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) in hemodialyzed patients (HDpts) and to compare IR between HDpts and subjects without renal failure, matched for sex, age, and BMI. We also compared the concentrations of adipocytokines in both groups to assess the factors that may have a potential impact on the value of HOMA-IR, with a particular focus on the concentration of adipocytokines, selected inflammation markers, and quantity of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) as measured by computed tomography (CT). Insulin concentration was measured using Immunotech IRMA kit. HOMA-IR was calculated using the formula: Visfatin was measured with Phoenix Pharmaceuticals Inc. competitive immunoenzymatic test. Average BMI in the HD group was 27.1\u00b15.2 kg/m In both groups we evaluated and compared HOMA-IR, concentrations of glucose, insulin, and adipocytokines: leptin, resistin, total adiponectin, HMWad. Our study showed that there is no statistically significant difference in HOMA-IR between the groups (median of HOMA-IR in the HD group was 1.3 and in the control group 1.4, Comparison of the individual adipocytokine concentrations in both groups showed significantly higher leptin and resistin concentrations (median of leptin concentration in the HD group was 12.78 mg/L, in the control group 5.96 mg/L, Analysis of relationship between IR and the individual parameters in HDpts demonstrated that IR assessed by HOMA-IR showed no association with BMI ( Evaluation of the relationship between the adipocytokine concentrations and VAT quantity showed a significant correlation of VAT quantity with leptin (r=0.553, We analyzed the relationship between IR and the hormones secreted by VAT. It was found that the relationship between HOMA-IR and leptin concentration was statistically significant ( Not all studies confirm that IR markers increased in CKD escalate with a decrease in GFR. Our previous work, based on the partial results of the same clinical work, showed no difference in insulin resistance measured by HOMA-IR in non-diabetic HDpts and healthy subjects. It demonstrated the usefulness of HOMA-IR and Disposition Index in the interpretation of carbohydrate disorders in HDpts [ Interpretation of the causes of significantly lower glycemia in HDpts is difficult. in his work on insulin concentrations in CKD note that patients with ESRD are characterized by a rather mild hyperglycemia in fasting state and impaired glucose tolerance in stress testing, although some researchers represent different views [ Our results do not support the hypothesis that in hemodialyzed patients with ESRD IR is higher than in the general population. The results obtained indicate that replacement therapy, by reducing the disturbances associated with advanced renal failure, can reduce IR, which is consistent with the work by Kabayashi et al. CT showed a significant correlation between VAT quantity and IR ( Heimb\u00fcrger et al. proved that leptin concentration showed a strong positive correlation with the quantity of adipose tissue [ Assessing the influence of adipocytokines on IR in the present study we found a statistically significant positive correlation between HOMA-IR and leptin in HDpts. Based on our research it should be concluded that the effect of leptin on IR may be a reflection of the impact of VAT synthesizing leptin. Leptin concentration is a reflection of the visceral tissue quantity and is not associated with IR, if one takes into account that the IR does not differ significantly between the groups of paired patients, while leptin concentrations in HDpts are twice as high. High levels of leptin concentration in ESRD lose their influence on IR. Leptin is \u201cbiologically inactive\u201d towards IR, although its correlation with HOMA-IR in HDpts is significant. The observed significance may be due to a strong relationship of leptin concentration with the quantity of VAT, therefore VAT may be significant for the existence of IR. Lack of biological effects of high levels of leptin concentrations on IR in ESRD can be explained referring to the exponential nature of the relationship presented in the work by Stenvinkel et al. [ The behavior of resistin concentration did not confirm the presence of correlation with HOMA-IR. Many results of the studies on the influence of resistin on IR do not confirm that this adipocytokine intensifies it, as it was originally thought [ It is believed that chronic inflammation may result in the stimulation of IR by the induction of proinflammatory cytokines. emphasize a positive correlation between IR and inflammatory state expressed by the value of CRP concentration that occurs in HDpts [ IR measured using HOMA-IR in patients treated with repeated HD does not differ from IR measured by the same method in subjects without renal failure, matched for sex, age and BMI. IR in HDpts is dependent on the quantity of VAT, and this relationship is more important than the influence of BMI on IR. Elevated levels of leptin and resistin concentrations in blood serum of HDpts have no effect on IR.

Forty-five percent of the IR Golgi/endosome protein network have common heritable variants associated with type 2 diabetes, including ATIC and AMPK. Using an in vitro reconstitution system and siRNA-mediated partial knockdown of ATIC and PTPLAD1 in HEK293 cells, we show that both ATIC and PTPLAD1 affect IR tyrosine phosphorylation and endocytosis. We further show that insulin stimulation and ATIC knockdown readily increase the level of AMPK-Thr172 phosphorylation in IR complexes. We observed that IR internalization was markedly decreased after AMPK\u03b12 knockdown, and treatment with the ATIC substrate AICAR, which is an allosteric activator of AMPK, increased IR endocytosis in cultured cells and in the liver. These results suggest the presence of a signaling mechanism that senses adenylate synthesis, ATP levels, and IR activation states and that acts in regulating IR autophosphorylation and endocytosis.", "In this study, we highlight the role of the IR in mediating breast tumor progression in both WT mice and a hyperinsulinemic MKR mouse model by induction of High levels of circulating insulin were demonstrated to be an important marker and/or mediator of greater breast cancer risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients ( Over the past two decades, most efforts were invested in developing strategies for targeting the IGF1R in cancer therapy, sparing the IR, due to concern about metabolic abnormalities secondary to IR inhibition ( We have recently demonstrated that dual inhibition of both IR and IGF1R could reduce mammary tumor growth rate ( Mouse mammary cancer cell line, Mvt-1, has been described previously ( FVB/N and MKR mice (FVB/N background) were used in this study. The generation of the MKR mice, transgenic mice with dominant negative IGF1R specifically targeted to the skeletal muscle, has been described previously ( Vectors (GIPZ) encoding the following microRNA-adapted shRNA 5\u2032-TGACTGTGAAATCTTCGGC-3\u2032 (mouse/human IGF1R), 5\u2032-AGACCAGACCCGA AGATTTCT-3\u2032 (mouse IR) packed in high-titer lentiviral particles were purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL, USA). For IR blockade, cells were pretreated for 30 min with 100 nM of the high-affinity IR antagonist S961 (a gift from Novo Nordisk, Maaloev, Denmark). The Mann\u2013Whitney In order to distinguish between the roles of IR and IGF1R in breast cancer initiation and progression, we used shRNA lentiviral technology to knock down each receptor in the murine mammary Mvt-1 cell line. Densitometric analysis indicates an approximately 70% reduction in IR expression in the Then, we examined the effect of each receptor KD on the functionality of cells. As Akt is activated by IGF1 stimulation in the To evaluate the role of IR and IGF1R in mammary tumor initiation and progression, control cells, To evaluate the effect of insulin on the cancer cell transcriptome, we examined gene expression variation along with enriched signaling pathways and gene networks in the Mvt-1 cells following insulin stimulation. Based on the observation of reduced tumor size following injection of the IR and IGF1R belong to the same subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases and they both share similar structures with overlapping functionality ( In the current study, we employed shRNA technology in order to discriminate between the roles of IR and IGF1R in tumorigenesis. As expected, we found that Previously, it has been demonstrated using the transgenic PyVmT/MKR and rtTA-Neu mice models and the syngeneic Met-1 and MCNeuA orthotopic mice models that hyperinsulinemia promotes accelerated mammary tumor growth through IR/IGF1R activation. However, there was no discrimination between the two receptor tyrosine kinases ( An additional finding in our study involves the metastatic potential of tumors imparted by the IR and IGF1R. IGF1R has been recently found to mediate the metastatic activity of the MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells but not their tumorigenicity ( Although the effect of insulin on gene expression has been studied on normal cells such as muscle cells and fibroblasts ( CD24 is an anchored cell-surface glycoprotein, mainly associated with the progression of invasive tumors through P-selectin binding, which is expressed by activated endothelial cells and platelets ( Using FACS analysis, we demonstrated the existence of two distinct and stable CD24 Then, we examined the hypothesis that the reduction in the high tumorigenic CD24 Taken together, the results of this study indicate a significant role for IR in the progression of mammary tumors, not only through mediating the mitogenic effect of insulin but also by a crosstalk with IGF1. We suggest that both IR and IGF1R should be targeted to achieve the desired inhibitory effect on tumor growth; however, such a strategy should be carried out in parallel with constant monitoring of blood glucose levels. Furthermore, we demonstrate in this study for the first time, to our knowledge, that CD24 expression is linked to IR in mediating mammary tumor growth. This may reveal a novel mechanism for the mitogenic effects of IR; however, further studies are required to explore the relationship between the two. These results indicating an important role for the IR in cancer progression could lead to new targeted therapeutics in women with breast cancer and other cancers that have similarly been shown to be associated with hyperinsulinemia in obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes. Severe IGF1R downregulation as accomplished by the shRNA construct results in increased IGF1 response via the IR. Cells were starved with a serum-free medium for 16 h and then treated for 30 min with 100 nM of the IR inhibitor S961 before treatment with 10 nM insulin or IGF1. The Mann\u2013Whitney IR plays a significant role in mammary tumor development and metastasis by reducing the activities of both the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways.", "Recruitment of ATM to DSB is dependent on MRN complex, although this DSB sensor may be not required for C-NHEJ under low dose or low-LET irradiation [ Over 700 protein targets have been identified as phosphorylated by ATM and/or ATR after genotoxic treatment according to large-scale proteomic screening and analysis [ Recruitment and autophosphorylation of ATM at the DSB site after IR damage requires further activation to maintain the ATM activity for substrate phosphorylation.", "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by IR was augmented in combination with CE, which was responsible for CE-mediated radiosensitization. In vivo, nude mouse xenografting data also revealed that tumor growth delay was greater in mice treated with CE plus IR, compared with those treated with CE or IR alone. When DHCE, instead of CE, was combined with IR, tumor growth delay was similar to that in IR alone-treated mice. These results demonstrate that CE synergistically enhances the effects of IR and suggest the novel anticancer therapeutic use of CE in combination with radiation therapy.", "In turn, local failure after radiotherapy remains 20\u201335% in intermediate and high risk patients ( An emerging strategy to improve efficacy at lower IR doses is the use of radiosensitizers to target recognition and repair of DNA damage ( Nonetheless, the mechanisms by which PARP inhibitors mediate their beneficial effects \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 localization to IR induced foci (IRIF) can serve as proxies for unrepaired DSBs and the DNA damage response ( Two human androgen-unresponsive prostate cancer cell lines were used: PC-3, which is PTEN-negative, p53-null and DU-145, PTEN wild type, p53 mutated ( To examine the effect of PARP inhibition on IRIF persistence in living cells, we exploited our previously described IRIF reporter consisting of GFP fused to the 53BP1 IRIF binding domain, expressed under tetracycline-inducible control (GFP-IBD, ref. These foci have been shown to represent accumulation of unrepaired endogenous DNA damage ( Following treatment with ABT-888 alone, we explored its effect in combination with IR. Nuclear GFP-IBD foci formed rapidly in PC-3 cells after 6 Gy and were prominent at 2 h but then diminished over the next 24 h ( In order to determine the effect on cell survival, PC-3 and DU-145 cells were analyzed by clonogenic assays after treatment with ABT-888 and IR, alone or in combination. 10 \u03bcM ABT-888 alone induced a significant inhibition in colony formation in PC-3 cells (100 \u00b1 5% for control versus 77 \u00b1 6% for ABT-888; We explored the effect of PARP inhibition and IR on cell cycle kinetics 48 h after treatment using permeabilization, propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Consistent with the formation of IRIF after addition of ABT-888 alone, PC-3 cells shifted toward G2/M DNA content, while DU-145 cells displayed no appreciable change in cell cycle distribution ( The persistence of DNA damage foci and G2/M shift led us to investigate cellular consequences of treatment with ABT-888 and IR. ABT-888 or IR treatment alone did not induce significant SA-\u03b2Gal activity or p21 expression in either cell line. However, we observed markers of accelerated senescence in PC-3 cells by 4 d after treatment with ABT-888 and IR, including an enlarged flat morphology and positive staining for SA-\u03b2Gal ( To investigate the effects of PARP inhibition and IR alone and in combination in tumor xenografts, PC-3 and DU-145 cells were injected into nude mice to form tumors. Mice were treated with ABT-888 and/or IR as described above. ABT-888 had a moderate effect slowing tumor growth in PC-3 tumors (mean V/V0 at 15 d, 13 in the ABT-888 group PARP inhibitors are a class of highly promising targeted therapy agents that are showing benefits alone and in combination with genotoxic therapy in a wide range of cancers in preclinical models and clinical trials ( When IR treatment was added to PARP inhibition Consistent with prior work from Mendes-Pereira et al.

Unfortunately, long-term cancer survivors are at increasing risks to develop treatment-related late effects, such as residual BM injury [ To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of MnTE on TBI-induced long-term BM injury in a mouse model, because MnTE has been proven efficacious in numerous The results presented in this study provide the proof-of-principle that post TBI treatment with MnTE can effectively mitigate IR-induced residual BM injury. It has been well established that oxidative stress can cause cellular senescence in a variety of cells including HSCs by induction of DNA damage such as DSBs [ However, MnTE has many other functions and biological activities [ In addition, it has been suggested that induction of oxidative DNA damage is also probably responsible for the induction of hematopoietic genetic instability by IR and chemotherapy [ Furthermore, there is an increasing body of evidence demonstrating that oxidative stress is a common cause for the induction of premature exhaustion of HSCs and hematopoietic genetic instability under various pathological conditions, including aging and mutations in the This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.", "Insulin-induced IR-autophosphorylation (HepG2, L6, INS1E), Akt-Ser Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex disorders due to the combination of genetic and environmental factors. To this purpose, cells were transfected with either Cells were either transfected, or not, with These data, strongly suggest that ENPP1 is an inhibitor of IR autophosphorylation in typical insulin target cells, as well as in insulin secreting beta-cells and that the Q121 variant is a gain of function aminoacid substitution with increased inhibitory activity. Studies in non insulin target cells have suggested that ENPP1 inhibitory activity on IR autophosphorylation is mediated by ENPP1/IR interaction Lower panel: HepG2 cells were either transfected (lanes 2\u20133) or not (lane 1) with In order to characterize the effect of ENPP1 on downstream insulin signaling in typical insulin target cells, we investigated Akt-Ser Insulin action on glucose metabolism was then assessed by studying mRNA level of the gluconeogenetic enzyme PEPCK in HepG2 cells and by investigating glucose transport and GLUT 4 expression level in L6 cells. Insulin secretion stimulated by glucose (16.7 mM, ( An important finding of this study is that increasing ENPP1 expression in liver HepG2 and skeletal muscle L6 cells affects IR activation, downstream insulin signaling and insulin action on glucose metabolism. In both cell types, the relatively rare ENPP1 Q121 variant exhibits, as compared to the K121 variant, a greater inhibition of IR activation and of most subsequent insulin signaling and action steps, thus behaving as a gain of function aminoacid substitution. In HepG2 cells, the Q121 variant shows a stronger physical interaction with the IR. This strengthen the hypothesis emerged from previous studies carried out in non typical insulin target cells that, as compared to ENPP1 K121, the Q121 variant is a stronger inhibitor of insulin signaling and action because of a stronger protein-protein interaction with the IR An additional finding of this study, which is entirely novel, is that ENPP1 expression induces defective IR activation, reduced insulin secretion upon stimulation of both glucose and glyburide, and increased susceptibility to apoptosis in pancreatic beta-cells; also in most of these circumstances, the Q121 variant behaves as a gain of function aminoacid substitution. Taken altogether, these findings clearly indicate that ENPP1, especially when the Q121 variant is operating, affects As far as data on glucose- as well as glyburide-stimulated insulin secretion is concerned, our findings contribute to support an emerging scenario suggesting that IR signaling abnormalities have a direct, detrimental role on insulin secreting beta-cells As far as our present data on the Q121 variant is concerned, it is of note they are quite consistent with previous findings obtained In conclusion, the data we obtained, clearly indicate that ENPP1 exerts HepG2 cells (ATCC, Manassas, USA) were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO Full-length cDNA of HepG2 and L6 cells were transiently transfected with the full length cDNA of either Cells lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).", "The activated tyrosine-phosphorylated IR was able to recruit and phosphorylate adaptor proteins such as insulin receptor substrate (IRS). The phosphorylated IRS activates PI3-kinase, resulting in the translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) to plasma membrane to facilitate glucose uptake. This IR\u2013IRS\u2013PI3-kinase signaling cascade is the representative metabolic pathway triggered by insulin. On the other hand, the mitogenic pathway in insulin signaling initiates phosphorylation of Shc by the activated IR and then activates Ras-MAPK signaling. When mouse adipocytes were cultured in low concentrations of TNF\u03b1 which do not cause generalized suppression of adipocyte gene expression including IRS-1 and GLUT-4, interference of insulin action by TNF\u03b1 occurred. The binding of between IR and CAV1 has been studied in detail. IR may be constitutively resident in caveolae GM3 is the major ganglioside present in serum and is known to be associated with serum lipoproteins. Before insulin stimulation (100 nM for 3 min), cells were starved in serum-free media containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin in the absence or presence of TNF\u03b1 and D-PDMP as above for 8 h. Proteins in cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antiserum to IR and IRS-1, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P. Western blot was then proved with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, stripped and reproved with antiserum to IR and IRS-1 (B) 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in the absence or presence of TNF\u03b1 and D-PDMP as in (A) and the ganglioside fraction was visualized by resorcinol staining on HPTLC. (A) Co-immunoprecipitation assay of Cav1 and IR. Post nuclear supernatants (PNS) of whole precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an anti-IR\u03b2 antibody. GM3 associates with IR but not with Cav1. Upper panel: PNS were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Cav1 antibody, an anti-IR\u03b2 antibody, or an anti-mouse or anti-rat IgG. The precipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an anti-IR\u03b2 or anti-Cav1 antibody. (B) Cross-linking assay of GM3 and IR. Adipocytes were treated with photoactivatable The lysine residue IR944 is essential for the interaction of IR with GM3. (A) Schematic representation of the proposed interaction of the lysine residue at IR944, which is located just above the transmembrane domain, and GM3 at the cell surface. (B) Enhanced mobility of IR in GM3-enriched membrane. (C) Specificity of the interaction between lysine at IR944 and GM3 by FRAP analyses. Upper panel: Schematic structure of IR-GFP mutants in which the lysine at IR944 is replaced with basic and neutral amino acids. Lower panel: Fluorescence recovery of IR-GFP mutants in GM3(+) and GM3(\u2212) cells. IR may be constitutively resident in caveolae Insulin resistance through increased GM3 levels in metabolic syndrome.", "Statins are known to inhibit IR injury, but the mechanism of action remains uncertain. In conclusions, IR and AT exerted opposing effects on caspase-3 activity by differing mechanisms, with IR stimulating caspase-3 proteolytic cleavage and AT inhibiting active caspase-3 enzyme.", "Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) (insulin\u00d7glycemia in (\u03bcmol/L)/22.5) was estimated. CV risk factors examined in the present study were overweight or obese (BMI >25kg/m), with abdominal obesity [waist circumference (WC)\u226580cm], insulin resistance (defined as a HOMA-IR>3.16) and dyslipidemia in accordance with serum perforin and granzyme-B levels . Adolescents with PCOS had significantly higher levels of fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR and granzyme-B when compared with controls. When all the participants (=172) were evaluated, only 16 adolescents were determined to have a HOMA-IR>3.16 (15 adolescents in PCOS group and only 1 in control group). Serum levels of granzyme-B were significantly higher in adolescents with IR when compared with the ones without IR (6.1\u00b12.7pg/ml and 2.3\u00b11.3pg/ml, respectively, <0.001). There were statistically significant positive correlations between granzyme B and BMI, WC, HOMA-IR, NLR and TG values while again a significant but negative correlation was observed between granzyme-B and HDL-C levels (<0.05). Granzyme-B levels were found to be significantly associated with increased HOMA-IR (OR=6.120, 95% CI: 2.352\u201315.926, <0.001) in PCOS patients. The present study is in consistence with the previous studies as we found that increased levels of serum granzyme-B levels are both associated with increased CV risk and IR among adolescent PCOS patients. Another important result of the present study is the independent association of granzyme-B with increased HOMA-IR. Besides, granzymes are recently suggested to play a potential role in the development of IR and Type II diabetes by promoting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines . All these data are in consistence with the results of the present study since we found that there is an independent association between granzyme-B and IR. So, we suggest that the possible underlying mechanism in IR and increased CV risk is the extracellular effects, possibly due to the inflammatory role of granzyme-B in PCOS patients.", "Treatment of PTEN-deficient Sh11.02 cells with 3 Gy IR did not augment TNF-\u03b1 secretion levels compared to time-matched control samples, ranging from between 20\u201380 pg/ml/10 Macrophages are a rich source of pro-inflammatory TNF-\u03b1. Justified by the enrichment of CD68-positive macrophages detected by IHC in PTEN-deficient prostate tumors, we assessed how exposure to IR modulated TNF-\u03b1 secretion from THP-1 cells. Treatment with 3 Gy IR promoted a rapid increase in the level of TNF-\u03b1 secretion observed, with a 21.09 \u00b1 5.5 fold increase evident within 30 min of exposure (Figure Experiments were conducted to evaluate how addition of THP-1 cells affected the degree of NF\u03baB activation observed in DU145 Sh11.02 cells, in the absence and presence of radiation. Of the proteins analyzed, only basal expression of Bcl-2 was different between unstimulated PTEN-expressing NT01 and PTEN-deficient Sh11.02 cells (Figure Given the coupling of TNF-\u03b1 signaling to pro-survival protein expression, we conducted colony count assays to determine whether repression of IR-induced, macrophage-derived TNF-\u03b1 signaling could influence cell survival. Administration of a neutralizing antibody to TNF-\u03b1 failed to decrease cell survival at clinically-relevant doses of IR in either the DU145 NT01 or Sh11.02 cells ( ( Determining that TNF-\u03b1 signaling preferentially induced a NF\u03baB pro-survival phenotype raised the potential of targeting upregulated transcriptional targets of this pathway. Treatment of DU145 Sh11.02 cells with 0.1, 1 or 10 \u03bcM AT-IAP for 4 h significantly reduced cIAP-1 protein expression (Figure The ability of AT-IAP to down-regulate cIAP-1 expression in DU145 Sh11.02 cells, cultured in the presence of macrophages and exposed to IR, was assessed by immunoblotting assays. Treatment with 1 \u03bcM AT-IAP for 4 h was sufficient to reverse 3 Gy IR and microenvironment-driven, THP-1 mediated increases in cIAP-1 expression (Figure ( Loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN is prevalent in men presenting with organ-confined prostate cancer and has prognostic value towards predicting poor response to radiotherapy [ Founded on the detection of macrophage enrichment in PTEN-deficient prostate tumors, we evaluated how the cellular compartments, studied in isolation and in co-culture responded to clinically-relevant doses of IR. All experiments were performed at a dose rate of 0.52 Gy min Analysis of THP-1 chemotaxis was performed using the 5 \u03bcm pore size CytoSelect Prostate cancer cells were plated into 6-well plates at a final density determined by the dose of IR to be received. Following IR, plates were returned to the incubator for 10\u201314 days until colonies in the control plate had reached a size of 50 cells or more.", "Serum LBP level significantly is elevated in PCOS, and is independently associated with IR in PCOS. Thus our study aims to explore the associations between serum LBP levels and PCOS and IR in PCOS. Body mass index (BMI) was determined as the ratio between weight and the square of height (kg/m Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed between the 5 HOMA2-IR: HOMA2-IR was used to estimate IR in all participants. Compared with the controls, PCOS subjects had a significantly higher BMI, WC, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), FINS, HOMA-IR, TG, hs-CRP, and LBP(33.03\u00b114.59 vs. 24.35\u00b110.31 \u03bcg/ml, p<0.001, Data are presented as mean\u00b1SD and analyzed by independent sample t-test; triglycerides (TG), fasting serum insulin (FINS), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour postload plasma glucose (2h-PPG) werelog-transformed before comparison. In the model withHOMA2-IR as a dependent variable, after adjusting for age, BMI, TG and hs-CRP, HOMA2-IR was still associated with the serum LBP level (standardized coefficient\u03b2 = -0.271, p = 0.005) as well. To our knowledge, this is the first time to investigate the association between LBP level, and IR in PCOS patients. According to Pearson correlation analyses and multiple linear regression analyses, LBP is associated with IR in women with PCOS, independent of BMI, FINS, SHBG, as well as hs-CRP. An epidemiological study of Spain suggests that serum LBP level is positively associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) [ Elevated circulating LBP levels in IR patients have been observed in some studies. Kheirandish-Gozal investigated the association between Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and obesity in children, and found that LBP was positively correlated with HOMA-IR (r = 0.757, p<0.001) in the whole sample [ Recently, Tremellen et al. However, we calculated HOMI2-IRto estimate IR for all the subjects, and the result was in accordance with the former. Moreover, this was a cross-sectional study, and further longitudinal studies are needed to establish a causal relationship between LBP and IR in PCOS. In summary, serum LBP level significantly surges in PCOS, and is associated with IR independently of BMI, FINS, and hs-CRP.", "IR injury is the main cause of primary graft dysfunction or nonfunction after liver transplantation. In addition, the liver suffers from warm IR injury during tissue resections (Pringle Maneuver), hemorrhagic or endotoxin shock, and thermal injury [ Recent studies in humans and experimental models have shown that aldosterone plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular and renal injury. In this regard, clinical trials have evidenced that mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blockade improves the survival of patients with chronic heart disease and chronic renal failure [ In this study, we sought to evaluate the effect of SPI in livers undergoing normothermic IR injury and to investigate if the protective effects of SPI could be associated with a reduction in oxidative stress and the inflammatory response. The hepatic hilum was identified and complete warm hepatic ischemia was induced by Pringle Maneuver [ A model of 70% hepatic ischemia was also used, following procedures described in the literature [ IR group ( IR + SPI group ( IR + SPI group ( IR + SPI group ( IR + SPI group ( IR + SPI group ( Sham group ( IR group ( IR + SPI group ( PIR group ( PIR + SPI group ( Immediately after obtaining the liver, the sample was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. All values are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) and We administered SPI at doses of 1,000, 2,600, 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 In the total liver normothermic IR model, the administration of spironolactone at the selected dose of 2.6 mg/kg (IR + SPI group) reduced ALT and AST levels compared with the results obtained in IR group (ALT values: 494 \u00b1 83.9 and 226 \u00b1 103 IU/L for the IR and IR + SPI, resp. ; AST values: 1072 \u00b1 198 and 559 \u00b1 176 IU/L, for the IR and IR + SPI, resp.) ( Similar results were obtained in the partial liver IR model, where the administration of spironolactone at the selected dose of 2.6 mg/kg (PIR + SPI group) reduced ALT and AST levels compared with the results obtained in PIR group (ALT values: 855 \u00b1 55 and 431 \u00b1 41 IU/L for the PIR and PIR + SPI, resp. ; AST values: 1085 \u00b1 75 and 708 \u00b1 80 IU/L, for the PIR and PIR + SPI, resp.) ( As shown in Regarding oxidative stress parameters, total antioxidant capacity of the IR and Sham groups was similar (total antioxidant capacity values: 3.07 \u00b1 0.52 and 2.96 \u00b1 0.52 mM, in IR and Sham groups, resp.). IR increased catalase activity and MDA levels when compared with the Sham group (catalase activity values: 214.22 \u00b1 61.1 and 18.9 \u00b1 8.50 nmol/min/mL, in IR and Sham groups, resp. ; MDA values: 18.0 \u00b1 2.75 and 11.1 \u00b1 0.96 We found that SPI was able to reduce liver IR injury in total liver IR models, as evidenced by attenuation of the histopathological alterations associated with IR injury as well as by reduction of serum levels of AST and ALT. Spironolactone is widely used in clinical practice [ As the experimental model of total hepatic IR involves the fact that both gut and liver are subjected to ischemic conditions, it is possible to consider that the observed effects on the liver might thus represent gut-originating responses to ischemia and their modification by SPI. To assess this possibility, an experimental model of partial hepatic IR was carried out to evaluate the effect of SPI on hepatic injury, since in this model intestinal congestion is prevented. Our results indicated that the same dose of SPI was able to reduce biochemical parameters of hepatic injury, thus indicating a liver-specific protective effect for SPI in normothermic hepatic IR. It is well known that, during hepatic IR, cytokines are released through the induction of adhesion molecules (ICAM and vascular cell adhesion molecule [VCAM]) and CXC chemokine which leads to neutrophil activation and accumulation. These neutrophils then extravasate, causing parenchymal injury by ROS production [ Spironolactone had a protective effect in several models of IR injury model through amelioration of oxidative stress. This could reflect more a systemic response to IR, irrespective of the beneficial effects we observed over histopathological scores. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated for the first time that SPI has hepatoprotective properties in IR liver injury model. Dose-response study of spironolactone on hepatic injury in total normothermic IR. Rats were treated with SPI (0, 1,000, 2,600, 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 Effect of spironolactone on biochemical parameters of liver injury in total normothermic IR. IR group (b) showed numerous inflammatory cell groups predominantly perivenular and presence of apoptotic bodies isolated surrounded by inflammation. The IR + SPI group (c) showed conserved cellular architecture, isolated pockets of acute inflammation, and apoptotic bodies. Effect of spironolactone on biochemical parameters of liver injury in normothermic PIR. Effect of spironolactone on cytokine production in normothermic IR injury. IL-1 Effect of spironolactone on oxidative stress in normothermic IR injury.", "We combined data from the each GWAS and our validation analyses using an inverse variance method and examined heterogeneity with a Cochran's We also performed quantitative traits analysis for fasting plasma glucose, HOMA-\u03b2 and HOMA-IR using multiple linear regression analysis in an additive association model with or without adjusting for age, sex and log-transformed BMI. The Japanese samples studied here show skewed distribution values for BMI, HOMA-IR and HOMA-\u03b2; therefore, we have analysed the quantitative traits using log-transformed BMI, HOMA-IR and HOMA-\u03b2.", "Sprague Dawley rats were used to model liver IR injury, and were divided into the sham operation group (SO), IR group and IP group. The results indicated that IR significantly increased Bax, caspase 3 and NF-\u03baBp65 expression levels, with reduced expression of Bcl-2 compared with the IP group. Compared with the IR group, the levels of AST, ALT, MPO, MDA, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 were significantly reduced in the IP group. Immunohistochemistry for Bcl-2 and Bax indicated that Bcl-2 expression in the IP group was significantly increased compared with the IR group. In addition, IP reduced Bax expression compared with the IR group. The average liver injury was worsened in the IR group and improved in the IP group, as indicated by the morphological evaluation of liver tissues. To conclude, IP provided protection against hepatic IR injury. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide ( In order to protect the ischemic areas resulting from IR, various methods have been utilized, including ischemic preconditioning (IP). IP refers to the induction of one or more transient IR episodes, resulting in the induction of endogenous protective mechanisms and conferring significant tolerance to longer duration ischemic injury. Przyklenk first described remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) in 1993, demonstrating that brief occlusion of the circumflex artery protects the myocardium from subsequent continuous IR injury ( A total of 15 male SD rats (weight, 250\u2013300 g, age, 10\u201312 weeks) were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of Yangzhou College (Yangzhou, China). The rats were divided into the sham operation group (SO group), ischemia-reperfusion group (IR group) and the remote intestinal IP+IR group (IP group), with 5 rats in each group. In the SO group, rats were anesthetized, an abdominal incision was made and the SMA and the hepatic pedicle were isolated and then the incision closed, with the incision open for the same duration as the IR and IP groups. In the IR group, the incision was made and the liver pedicle clamped to block 70% of blood flow to the liver for 30 min, followed by 3 h reperfusion and the closing of the incision. The mechanism by which IP reduces liver IR injury remains to be fully elucidated. The levels of apoptosis in hepatocytes reflects alterations in liver function and reserve capacity, and is an important pathological feature of HIRI, associated with postoperative residual liver dysfunction ( NF-\u03baB is a nuclear transcription factor that regulates the expression of numerous genes that are critical for the regulation of apoptosis, viral replication, tumorigenesis, inflammation and various autoimmune diseases. A wide variety of stimuli, which have been extensively studied over the past two decades ( MDA is the final product of lipid peroxidation and an important parameter in the evaluation of IR-associated oxidative injury. Cell damage further intensifies with MDA formation ( Previous studies have indicated that IP results in significant improvements in liver function, as indicated by serum AST and ALT levels ( In conclusion, IP provided protection against hepatic IR injury by upregulating the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and reducing the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax and caspase 3.", "Similarly, IRS1 is associated with lower levels of TG, higher levels of HDL, lower fasting insulin levels, and decreased CAD risk; all opposite to what would be expected with MetS [ Studying monogenic forms of MetS and its form fruste partial lipodystrophies has resulted in identification of factors that underly the association of diverse metabolic traits. LDL: low density lipoprotein, TG: triglycerides, IR: insulin receptor, VSMC: vascular smooth muscle cell, and FZD: frizzled receptor.", "At the 6\u2010h timepoint, there were no significant differences for IR protein present between groups (Fig. Altered insulin receptor protein and To determine if these changes in IR protein levels resulted from altered gene expression, quantitative real\u2010time PCR was used to measure mRNA levels. At the 6\u2010h timepoint, there was a 2\u2010fold increase in IR mRNA levels in the polytrauma (burn/CLP) group, which was significantly higher than sham/sham or either single injury (Fig. Skeletal muscle insulin signaling was assessed with Western blotting for tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (PY1150/51\u2010IR) in response to exogenous insulin treatment. Insulin induction of PY1150/51\u2010IR was assessed in two ways, based solely on the PY1150/51\u2010IR signal and, since there were decreased total\u2010IR levels in the polytrauma group at 24 h, the PY1150/51\u2010IR signal was corrected for the total amount of IR protein present. To further investigate the effects of polytrauma on the insulin\u2010signaling pathway, protein and mRNA levels of insulin receptor substrate\u20101 (IRS\u20101) were measured. At the 24\u2010h timepoint, IRS\u20101 protein levels were decreased by both single injuries and burn/CLP (Fig. Changes to protein and Insulin receptor substrate\u20101 mRNA levels were examined to determine if the observed decreases in IRS\u20101 protein were due to decreased gene expression/transcript stability. Twenty\u2010four hours following injury, IRS\u20101 mRNA levels were significantly reduced by both single injuries and burn/CLP (Fig. However, taken together, these results suggest the reduced IRS\u20101 protein (and mRNA) levels observed in burn/sham and sham/CLP were not sufficient to decrease downstream insulin signaling, because there was no decrease, as measured by changes in P\u2010AKT. Thus, the reduced IRS\u20101 protein levels observed in skeletal muscle following polytrauma may not be a major contributor to the polytrauma\u2010specific insulin resistance observed at 24 h. But in the context of polytrauma\u2010driven decreased insulin receptor phosphorylation/activation, the decrease in IRS\u20101 protein may contribute to decreased downstream insulin signaling.", "To explore this issue, we carried out the present study using a Dex\u2010induced IR model in the rats and rat hepatocyte lines. We found that both liver and intra\u2010abdominal adipose in the rats synthesize 5\u2010HT, which is upregulated by chronic Dex exposure, and is an important reason for Dex\u2010induced IR in whole\u2010body and both tissues. We detected expression of Tph1 and AADC in the liver and intra\u2010abdominal adipose, whereas they were not detected in the skeletal muscle (Figure GC\u2010induced IR in the liver can be determined by examination of glucose uptake, gluconeogenesis and steatosis, whereas that in adipose tissue can be determined by examining lipolysis (a) Messenger ribonucleic acid expressions of glycerin\u20103\u2010phosphate acyltransferase 1 ( The mRNA and protein expressions of Tph1 and AADC with 5\u2010HT content were detected in the cultured BRL\u20103A cells (a) Messenger ribonucleic acid and (b) protein expressions of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1) and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase ( In the present study, cultured BRL\u20103A cells were treated with 5\u2010HT with or without Flx treatment, a 5\u2010HTT inhibitor that restrains 5\u2010HT uptake through 5\u2010HTT in the cell. Nevertheless, Flx failed to fully abolish 5\u2010HT effects in the cells, suggesting that, besides 5\u2010HT entering into the cells, there exists others that mediate IR. The results suggested that, similar to Dex exposure, exogenous 5\u2010HT action also involves 5\u2010HT\u2010induced IR in the BRL\u20103A cells by entering into the cells through 5\u2010HTT. The results are shown in Figure (a) Alterations of messenger ribonucleic acid expressions of glycerin\u20103\u2010phosphate acyltransferase 1 ( The present study examined the contribution of 5\u2010HT to Dex\u2010induced IR, focusing mainly on the liver and intra\u2010abdominal adipose. GC exposure in humans is well known to result in whole\u2010body IR, and GC\u2010induced IR has also been confirmed when animals were chronically exposed to excess GC To date, the mechanisms of GC\u2010induced IR in the liver and adipose tissue still remain to be elucidated. The present study showed that GC\u2010induced IR in the liver and intra\u2010abdominal adipose is, at least in part, caused by GC\u2010induced 5\u2010HT increase by upregulating 5\u2010HT synthesis. The mechanisms by which 5\u2010HT results in IR in the hepatocytes and adipocytes have been shown. 5\u2010HT through activating mammalian target of rapamycin signaling stimulates lipogenesis in the liver, and leads to serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate\u20101 to impair insulin signal transduction in the adipocytes Taken together, the present study reveals the fact that 5\u2010HT is synthesized both in the liver and intra\u2010abdominal adipose, which is activated by chronic GC overexposure, and is an important reason for GC\u2010induced IR in both organs and whole body. GC also upregulates 5\u2010HT 2 receptors in both organs, which might be another reason for GC\u2010induced IR. Whether there is a synergistic effect on GC\u2010induced IR between increased 5\u2010HT synthesis and enhanced 5\u2010HT 2 receptors requires further investigation. The present study provides evidence that 5\u2010HT might represent a novel target for the prevention and treatment of GC\u2010induced IR.", "Similarly, obesity-related IR may be observed in patients presenting with \u201ctextbook\u201d type 1 DM ( Qualitative illustration of the spectrum of factors associated with different forms of DM, including the variable age at onset, lack of obesity, metabolic syndrome, genetic associations, different forms of immune changes, C-peptide secretion, and the need for insulin therapy. ( The use of IR to define type 2 DM similarly needs consideration. The fact that many obese patients with IR do not develop DM indicates that IR is insufficient to cause type 2 DM without predisposing factors that affect \u03b2-cell function ( The current classification schema imposes unintended constraints on individualized medicine. The \u03b2-cell\u2013centric classification system recognizes the interplay of genetics, IR, environmental factors, and inflammation/immune system on the function and mass of \u03b2-cells ( Genetic determinants influence IR (whether centrally or peripherally induced), loss of \u03b2-cell function and mass, environmental triggers (such as viruses, endocrine disruptors, food advanced glycosylation end products, gut biome), and immune modulation and inflammation. The mediating pathways of hyperglycemia that contribute to \u03b2-cell dysfunction include liver, muscle, and adipose tissue (organs associated with IR) and brain, colon, and immune dysregulation. Despite the capacity of insulin therapy to manage glucotoxicity, there is a concern for \u03b2-cell damage due to IR that has been exacerbated by exogenous insulin-induced hyperinsulinemia and weight gain ( The \u03b2-cell\u2013centric model recognizes that the final common denominator of DM is the genetically predisposed, dysfunctional \u03b2-cell, which ultimately leads to compromised \u03b2-cell function, loss in \u03b2-cell mass, or depleted insulin content in the face of IR. These may include monogenic or polygenic defects that predispose to hyperinsulinemia, IR, more recently understood mechanisms such as inflammation by the immune system ( Clinically evident DM ensues at or after the juncture when the combined gene\u2013environment trigger reaches a tipping point for sufficient \u03b2-cell compromise to be expressed as phenotypic hyperglycemia. In our model, as typical in obesity, IR is a monogenic or, more commonly, a polygenic disorder ( We propose that the \u03b2-cell\u2013centric model is a conceptual framework that could help optimize processes of care for DM.", "While capable of transforming cells in culture, this IR cDNA-containing virus, called UIR, was not able to induce tumors in animals. Subsequently, we isolated a spontaneous sarcomagenic variant called UIR19t from the parental UIR. UIR19t was molecularly cloned, sequenced, and found to harbor two mutations. A 44-amino acid deletion immediately upstream from the transmembrane domain of the Gag-IR fusion protein removes all the extracellular sequence of the IR remaining in the original UIR construct. The specific kinase activity of UIR19t is 4- to 5-fold higher than that of the parental UIR. However, no new cellular substrates were detected in UIR19t-transformed cells as compared to UIR cells. We conclude that sequence immediately upstream from the transmembrane domain imposes a negative effect on the transforming and tumorigenic potential of the Gag-IR fusion protein.", "However, IR also activates sophisticated anti-apoptotic transcriptional factors such that cancer cells fail to repair DNA damage and obtain resistance to apoptosis under conditions of radiotherapy. The primary purpose of this review is to introduce the studies of the signaling mechanisms of IR in NF-\u03baB activation, such as ROS/NF-\u03baB, ATM or DNA-PK/MAPKK/ p90rsk, PI3K/AKT/IKK and k-ras/c-raf/ MEKK/ NF-\u03baB pathways. In addition, IR activates NF-\u03baB to express cell cycle-specific genes, for example cyclin D1, which is associated with reinforcing radioresistance. We exhibit the signaling pathways that are induced by IR stimulation of NF-\u03baB and illustrate the molecular mechanisms of radioresistance.", "This study examines the effects of MI-related IR on vasorelaxation and its underlying mechanisms, with a specific focus on the role of exercise in reversing the impaired vasorelaxation. Growing literature implicates IR as a risk factor for the development of heart failure and suggests that measures beyond targeting coronary artery disease are necessary to mitigate this risk (Stakos et al. Therefore, in this study, we sought to determine the relationship between myocardial infarction and IR. Secondary questions included determining whether exercise training reduces IR post-MI, as well as studying the specific signaling mechanism by which exercise training reduces post-MI-related IR. In addition, we assessed the expression and distribution of eNOS and TNF- Effects of myocardial infarction and exercise training on the expression and distribution of eNOS and TNF- Previous evidence showed that IR has a close relationship with endothelial dysfunction. As expected, in PE precontracted arterial rings from rats, insulin produced a dose-dependent vasorelaxation with the maximal response occurring at 1.5 \u00d7 10 Previous studies showed that inflammatory cytokines play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of IR (Sturek Effects of myocardial infarction and exercise training on the expression of IL-1 Considerable evidence has demonstrated that eNOS-derived NO exerts a pivotal role in vasorelaxation, and PI3K and Akt are known to be important upstream regulators of eNOS activation (Fulton et al. MI attenuated PI3K/Akt/eNOS phosphorylation and NO production by insulin ( In this study, we demonstrated that myocardial infarction causes IR, as well as impaired vasodilation in response to ACh and insulin in aortas, decreased activities of PI3K, Akt, and eNOS, and attenuated insulin-induced PI3K/Akt/eNOS phosphorylation. This may, help explain how exercise reduces IR. To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively investigate the beneficial effects of exercise on post-MI-induced IR, vascular impairments, and related mechanisms. Recent studies showed that IR appears in the acute phase of myocardial infarction in nondiabetic patients (Trifunovic et al. Numerous studies in both humans and animals have demonstrated that exercise training benefits cardiovascular disease and reduces IR (Li et al. In summary, the present study demonstrates that under conditions of post-MI-associated IR, increasing insulin levels in the circulation may induce a hypertensive response, and exercise-induced increase in eNOS activation significantly improves insulin sensitivity in aortas. These results suggest that post-MI-associated IR may play an important role in the increased risk for heart failure in MI patients.", "In contrast, a conclusion that radiation exposure enhanced the Th2 response cytokine production was achieved in murine splenocytes when In many systems, an adaptive resistance response to lethality of radiation doses after a challenge acute irradiation is found to be closely related to recovery ( The immune modulations following \u03b3-irradiation of intact spleen, splenocytes, or whole body are totally different and the use of different doses of IR reflects the difference in radio-sensitivity and/or radio-resistance of immune cells with no correlation between cell proliferation and cytokine production.", "Further, GSK1838705A significantly inhibited phosphorylation of IGF1R/IR. IGF1R and IR are overexpressed in prostate cancers, and the signaling mediated by these receptor tyrosine kinases promotes proliferation and survival of prostate cancer cells. Rabbit anti-phospho-IGF1R, anti-phospho-IR, anti-IGF1R, anti-IR, anti-cleaved caspase-3, mouse anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody were sourced from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). The results showed an approximately 16-fold increase in the IC The IGF1R and IR are known to be important mediators of viability in prostate cancer cells. IGF1R/IR-mediated signaling pathways play a crucial role in inhibiting apoptosis and increasing cell viability, We next observed the effect of GSK1838705A on phosphorylation of IGF1R and IR in PC-3R cells. We found that GSK1838705A could significantly inhibit phosphorylation of IGF1R and IR, while there were no significant changes in total protein levels ( IGF1R/IR-mediated signaling plays a critical role in migration of cancer cells, To further validate our in vitro work, nud/nud mice were treated with GSK1838705A (20 and 60 mg/kg) to evaluate the effect of GSK1838705A (intraperitoneal injection) on docetaxel-resistant PC-3R tumor growth in vivo. IGF1R/IR-mediated signaling pathways promote proliferation and survival of a number of cancer cells, including prostate cancer cells, In summary, this is the first report of the effect of GSK1838705A, an IGF1R/IR inhibitor, on prostate cancer cells and tumors. GSK1838705A inhibits phosphorylation of IGF1R and IR in docetaxel-resistant cells.", "In this study, we investigated the effects of IR on the differentiation of Neuro-2a mouse neuroblastoma cells and the involvement of tumor protein 53 (p53) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) during this process. Mouse primary neural stem cells (NSC) were exposed to IR at 1 Gy. Immunocytochemistry revealed that neuronal class III beta-tubulin (Tuj-1) positive cells were increased and nestin positive cells were decreased by IR in Neuro-2a cells, which supported the IR-induced neuronal differentiation. However, the IR-induced neuronal differentiation was significantly attenuated when p53 was inhibited by pifithrin-\u03b1 (PFT-\u03b1) or p53-small interfering RNA (siRNA). The PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, also suppressed the IR-induced neurite outgrowth, the activation of p53, the expression of GAP-43 and Rab13, and the increase of Tuj-1 positive cells. The increase of neurite outgrowth and Tuj-1 positive cells by IR and its suppression by LY294002 were also observed in mouse primary NSC. These results suggest that IR is able to trigger the neuronal differentiation of Neuro-2a cells and the activation of p53 via PI3K is an important step for the IR-induced differentiation of Neuro-2a cells.", "Activation of the IR by IGF-2 results in increased survival of tumor cells. We have previously identified a novel human monoclonal antibody, m708.5, which binds with high (pM) affinity to both human IGF-1 and IGF-2, and potently inhibits phosphorylation of the IGF-1R and the IR in tumor cells. The antibody m708.5 was shown to inhibit the activity of both IGF-1R and IR by neutralizing IGF-1 and IGF-2 in The heavy and light variable regions of m708.5 were cloned into CHO GS expression vector, including human IgG1 constant regions. Mouse anti-IGF-1R or anti-IR-A antibody (BD Biosciences) was incubated with 10 Tumor cells were seeded into tissue culture 96-well plates in RPMI1640 medium containing 2.5% FBS. After 2 days of treatment, m708.5 reduced cell proliferation of 8 neuroblastoma cell lines ( As shown in Temsirolimus (mTOR inhibitor) was tested in combination with m708.5 because of the importance of mTOR as an escape pathway during IGF-1R inhibition and its relative safety and clinical activity in neuroblastoma ( Enhanced expression of IR-A was previously found to be a compensatory survival mechanism in cancer cells where IGF-1R signaling was inhibited ( Antitumor activity of m708.5 was evaluated After s.c. SK-N-MM tumor implantation in SCID mice, treatment was initiated when the average tumor size reached 75\u2013100 mm In separate experiments, mice treated with decreased duration of m708.5 (3 weeks instead of 4 weeks), there was no regression observed in the combination group even though the dose of temsirolimus was increased to 0.125mg ( The IGF signaling system is important in tumorigenesis. A remarkable feature of IGF-2 (but not IGF-1) is that it can also bind to the IR and enhance cell proliferation. IR is a known mitogenic driver for tumor cells, and IR activated by IGF-2, can compensate for IGF-1R disruption in tumor cells ( During the past decade, IGF-1R was deemed a promising target for cancer therapy with over 30 agents brought into early-phase clinical studies ( The dual specific m708.5 ( In this study, antitumor effects of m708.5 were evaluated in neuroblastoma as a single agent and in combination with cytotoxics The IGF-1R pathway is involved in a complex signaling cross-talk through multiple growth factors, receptors and down-stream effectors: two critical pathways, one through IRS, PI3K, AKT and mTOR for mitogenesis or survival, and one through Shc, RAS, RAF, MEK and ERK for inhibition of apoptosis. IGF-1R and IR-A signaling driven by IGF-1/IGF-2 promotes neuroblastoma tumorigenesis.", "In this work, we have studied the participation of VRK1 in DNA damage responses, including global chromatin acetylation and effects on histone interaction, phosphorylation and formation of \u03b3H2AX foci, which is a very early event in IR-induced DNA damage. Since the formation of \u03b3H2AX foci is the earliest manifestation of DDR VRK1 is required for \u03b3H2AX foci induced by IR. To establish whether the kinase activity of VRK1 is necessary to form \u03b3H2AX foci induced by IR, rescue experiments were performed using VRK1 constructs that are resistant (R) to knockdown with siVRK1-01 and expressing either a kinase active VRK1 (VRK1-R) or a kinase inactiveVRK1 (VRK1-R-K VRK1 activity is required for \u03b3H2AX foci formation. IR induces an interaction between VRK1 and 53BP1 that is specifically phosphorylated in Ser25, and VRK1 depletion also impairs formation of 53BP1 foci.", "These data identify specific nonlinear biological responses to low (less than 1000 mGy) dose IR-induced DNA damage in the lens epithelium. Vision is one of the most important senses to animals, which has evolved successfully to allow spatial definition [ Since the end of the nineteenth century, the eye lens has been known to be a radiosensitive tissue [ It is well known that IR causes double strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA, either by direct or indirect means. Formation of this complex allows other repair proteins to bind [ To address such questions, a low-dose IR exposure model was developed in response to recent ICRP recommendations [ Six-week-old C57BL/6J mice (Harlan, UK), in groups of two males and two females, were exposed to single doses of IR in an X-ray chamber irradiator (250 kVp, with Gulway generator (AGO Ltd, model no. Cells in the GZ, TZ and MR, comprising the peripheral region of the lens, are shielded from light, but not IR, by the iris and are out of the visual axis. The protocol was followed as described, with the exception that Histopaque density medium 1077 (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd, UK) was used for mouse lymphocytes [ To measure changes to the eye lens shape, 10 months after IR exposure eyes were dissected, lenses removed and put into M199 media (Gibco Life Technologies, UK) and images recorded for each lens (Nikon SMZ1500). For densitometry analysis, the bands were visualized using FUJIFILM IR LAS-1000 P Almost all the datasets were normally distributed (Anderson Darling The susceptibility of human LECs to low-dose ionizing radiation. The human lens cell line FHL124 was exposed to low-dose IR up to 2.28 Gy. Exposed cells were then processed for both immunofluoresence microscopy ( For the FHL124 human lens cell line, \u03b3H2AX, 53BP1, RAD51, MRE11 and TP53 band intensities were measured after exposure to 0\u20132260 mGy IR. We developed a novel statistical model to look for evidence that IR affected lens shape because the relation of changes in lens aspect ratio with IR dose did not appear to be linear, nor did the variation in aspect ratios appear to be normally distributed. Specifically, linear effects were investigated by comparing the model having For the initial studies of the lens response to low-dose IR, we selected the FHL124 human lens epithelium cell line as it shares 99.5% gene homology with native lens tissue and expresses phenotypic LEC markers [ To extend these findings still further, we investigated the response of the lens epithelium itself by exposing mice to a range (20\u20132000 mGy) of IR doses. LECs in culture have lost the spatial cues that typify the lens epithelium, where cell proliferation varies considerably dependent upon the location of the cells in the lens epithelium [ Dose-dependent increase in \u03b3H2AX foci in the nuclei of LECs after exposure to low-dose IR. Mice were irradiated with increasing levels of IR. Representative images are shown for central and peripheral regions of the lens ( The effect of IR on RAD51 was then investigated ( Formation of RAD51 containing foci in nuclei of LECs after exposure to low-dose IR. After irradiation (see A similar analysis of 53BP1 was then performed ( Dose dependent increase in 53BP1 foci in the nuclei of LECs after exposure to low-dose IR. After irradiation (see In order to determine the relative radiosensitivity of the peripheral region to other cells in the irradiated mouse, we carried out a direct comparison of radiation-induced \u03b3H2AX foci in the mouse lens epithelium and circulating blood lymphocytes ( Statistical analysis of the effects of low-dose IR on LECs compared with circulating blood lymphocytes. The formation of new lens fibre cells is entirely dependent upon cell proliferation in the GZ [ Initial analysis of cell density ( Effect of low-dose IR upon cell proliferation in the mouse lens epithelium. Therefore, we measured the aspect ratios of lenses 10 months after the initial exposure to IR ( Long-term effect upon lens growth of IR exposure. The aspect ratio was measured and the datasets for control ( The major finding of this study was the demonstration that IR has distinct effects dependent upon both the regions of the lens epithelium being investigated and the doses to which they are exposed. We have demonstrated DNA DSB responses ( Our data concerning the persistence of \u03b3H2AX foci in the periphery of the irradiated mouse lens (figures Using primary human [ It is well established that cell proliferation ceases in the GZ of the lens epithelium after IR exposure (more than 15 Gy), causing a decrease in GZ cell density and the disorganization of cells in the TZ and MR within the peripheral region [ In this study, the observation that mouse LECs responded to higher doses of IR (1000\u20132000 mGy) by a reduction in EdU incorporation and a reduction in cyclin D1 levels in the GZ is consistent with cell cycle arrest 24 h post-irradiation in the GZ and mirrors observations made in other animal models using much higher (more than 9 Gy) IR doses [ From studies of cataract incidence in astronauts, others have also concluded that low-dose IR can elicit such nonlinear biological responses in the lens [ A mechanistic link between low-dose IR and the deficiencies in DSB repair and the increased proliferative response and increased levels of cyclin D1 of the epithelial cells in the periphery of the lens epithelium as observed in this study is plausible ( Working model based on the linear dose response of cumulative DNA damage with IR dose in lens epithelium. Such responses are increased with IR dose, but limited by the cumulative DNA damage and incorporating the nonlinearity and stochastic nature of these responses. The results of this study have demonstrated that: (i) peripheral LECs repair DSBs after exposure to 20 and 100 mGy more slowly than circulating blood lymphocytes; (ii) initial effects within 1\u20133 h of IR exposure appear to follow linear-no-threshold responses at low doses; however (iii) later time points (24 h\u201310 months) revealed nonlinear biological responses, with evidence of differential low (less than 1000 mGy) and high dose-responses.", "To investigate the role of IR expression and function in platelets, mice homozygous for a floxed IR allele in which IRS-1, IRS-2, p85, Akt, pSer Mice (8\u201316 weeks old) were sacrificed by rising CO Murine femurs were immersion-fixed for 1 h in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer. Data presented with statistical analysis were tested using a Student's We, and others, previously demonstrated that human platelets express IR, IGF1R, and the substrates IRS-1 and 2. Mouse platelets express functional IRs. ( Insulin acting at IR enhances mouse platelet function. ( Insulin (20 nM) significantly increased platelet aggregation induced by the predominant murine thrombin receptor PAR-4 in WT mouse platelets ( To investigate whether insulin resistance affects platelet activity, we analysed platelet activation by PAR-4 and the collagen receptor GPVI in IR-deficient platelets. PAR-4-mediated platelet aggregation ( Deletion of IR results in a reduction in GPVI-mediated platelet activation. ( We next investigated whether GPVI-mediated signalling events were affected in IR-deficient platelets. Stimulation of platelets with CRP-XL (1 \u00b5g/ml) for either 0.5 or 5 min resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR \u03b3-chain, Syk (Tyr Deletion of IR results in a reduction in GPVI signalling. Stimulation of platelets with CRP-XL (1 \u00b5g/mL) induced phosphorylation of ( Genetic deletion of IR will result not only in the loss of IR homodimers but also of IR/IGF1R heterodimers. These IR/IGF1R heterodimers are thought to play a predominant role in mediating IGF-1s signalling in platelets and support of platelet function. Reduction in IGF-1 and IGF-2 signalling in IR-deficient platelets. Stimulation of platelets (4 \u00d7 10 Owing to the decrease in IGF-1/2 signalling, we examined whether the effect of IGF-1/2 on platelet function was also compromised in IR-deficient platelets. IGF-1 ( Our data suggest that maximal GPVI-mediated platelet activation requires the tyrosine kinase activity of IR and/or IR/IGF1R. Immunoprecipitation of IR demonstrated that IR/IGF1R hybrids are present in mouse platelets, and that these are tyrosine-phosphorylated by CRP-XL ( Pharmacological inhibition of IR/IGF1R reduces GPVI platelet activation to levels comparable to IR-deficient platelets. ( To confirm that IR/IGF1R activity is required to support GPVI-mediated platelet activation, we used NVP-AEW541, a potent inhibitor of IR and IGF1R kinase activity. Interestingly, IR KO mice had elevated platelet counts and increased mean platelet volumes, which are frequently reported in patients with obesity and T2DM, Deletion of IR resulted in a significant and specific decrease in GPVI function in mouse platelets. Furthermore, we found that CRP-XL induced weak tyrosine phosphorylation of IR/IGF1R heterodimers, suggesting that these hybrid receptors may play a role in supporting GPVI-mediated platelet function. One of the mechanisms by which the tyrosine kinase activity of the IR/IGF1R hybrids could be activated is by the release of IGFs from activated platelets. Interestingly, however, PAR4-AP-mediated platelet function was not affected by IR deletion or the IR/IGFR kinase inhibitor NVP-AEW541, and we were unable to detect IR/IGFR hybrid phosphorylation by PAR4-AP, demonstrating that IR/IGFR activity and/or released IGF does not contribute to PAR4-mediated platelet function under these conditions. We indeed found that CRP-XL (5 \u00b5g/mL, 5 min) induced more release of IGF-1 and IGF-2 (44.3 \u00b1 7.25 and 143.3 \u00b1 62.2 pM, respectively, increase from basal per 5 \u00d7 10 The observation that insulin significantly enhanced mouse platelet activation is interesting, as it demonstrates that signalling downstream of IR homodimers increases platelet function. Furthermore, insulin, IGF-1 and IGF-2 are able to enhance mouse platelet activation and a loss in IR/IGF1R activity impacts on GPVI-mediated signalling and function in platelets.", "To elucidate the role of Gal\u20109, we used a mouse model of partial liver ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) with wild type (WT) and Gal\u20109 knockout (KO) mice as well as a recombinant galectin\u20109 (reGal\u20109) protein. We found that the expression of Gal\u20109 was enhanced endogenously in the liver especially by hepatocytes and Kupffer cells during warm IRI for a mouse liver, which causes massive destruction of liver tissue. The present study elucidates a novel role of Gal\u20109 signaling in mouse liver IRI, by using Gal\u20109\u2013deficient mice and a stable form of reGal\u20109 protein. Interestingly, severe liver damage due to IR in Gal\u20109 KO mice was improved by the administration of reGal\u20109. In conclusion, Gal\u20109 engagement ameliorated local inflammation and liver damage induced by IR, and the present study suggests a significant role of Gal\u20109 in the maintenance of hepatic homeostasis.

IRI in the liver causes approximately 10% of early graft failure, can lead to a higher incidence of acute and chronic rejection, and contributes to the acute shortage of donor organs available for transplantation. Binding of Gal\u20109 to TIM\u20103 causes an inhibitory signal that results in the induction of apoptosis of T helper (T This study was focused on examining the putative role of Gal\u20109 in the pathophysiology of a mouse liver model for warm IRI. Our results demonstrate that Gal\u20109 engagement ameliorated local inflammation and liver damage due to IR, suggesting the importance of Gal\u20109 signaling in the maintenance of hepatic homeostasis, expansion of the organ donor pool, and improvement of the overall success of liver transplantation. Gal\u20109 knockout (KO; Gal\u20109 We used an established mouse model of partial warm hepatic IRI. The severity of liver IRI (necrosis, sinusoidal congestion, and centrilobular ballooning) was blindly graded with a modified Suzuki's criteria on a scale from 0 to 4. Expression of Gal\u20109 in IRI livers. Hepatocellular damages in warm IRI were analyzed by using wild type (WT) mice and Gal\u20109\u2013deficient mice. The damage due to IR was profoundly exacerbated in Gal\u20109 Liver damage induced by IRI in wild mice or Gal\u20109 deficient mice with or without reGal\u20109 pretreatment. Means and SEM are shown (* To elucidate the function of Gal\u20109 during liver IR, we applied reGal\u20109 in our mouse IRI model. Means and SEM are shown (** Although relatively small but significant numbers of CD3\u2010positive T cells could be found in IR\u2010injured wild mice, the numbers of T cells further decreased in the mice pretreated with reGal\u20109 at 6 hours after reperfusion (Fig. Immunohistochemical staining for CD3\u2010, CD68\u2010, and Ly6\u2010G\u2013expressing cells in IRI livers. Means and SEM are shown (* We then examined the effects of a Gal\u20109 deficiency and the reGal\u20109 pretreatment on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which have been reported to be important in the mechanism of liver IRI. Cytokines (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 [TNF\u2010\u03b1], interleukin [IL]\u20106, IL\u20101\u03b2, and interferon [IFN]\u2010\u03b3) and chemokine ligand (CXCL; CXCL1 and CXCL2, which are chemotactic for macrophages) were measured during liver IRI by quantitative reverse\u2010transcription PCR (Fig. Quantitative real\u2010time PCR\u2013assisted detection of gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in IRI livers.

Means and SEM are shown (* Finally, the expression of TLR4, which has been reported to be critical in the pathogenesis of liver IRI, The present study provides clear evidence that Gal\u20109 has a crucial role as an endogenous protective factor in the pathogenesis of warm IRI in a mouse liver. First, Gal\u20109 expression in the liver rapidly increased at the early stage of liver IRI and continued during the course. Second, absence of Gal\u20109 exacerbated profoundly the IR\u2010induced hepatocellular damage. On the contrary, administration of reGal\u20109 significantly improved liver damage because of IR in the wild as well as in the Gal\u20109 The most interesting data in this study are that the expression of endogenous Gal\u20109 was rapidly enhanced in the liver right after the onset of the liver IR insult, and this fast and furious expression started from an early time during IR, especially at the ischemic stage that is just before reperfusion. Thus, the question arises as to how Gal\u20109 affects IR\u2010caused liver damage. It has been reported that Gal\u20109 is a ligand of TIM\u20103 that is expressed on T TLR4 has been reported to be involved in the initiation of IRI, as evidenced by the full protection of TLR4\u2010deficient livers. Figure Cross\u2010talk interactions underlying the protective effects of Gal\u20109 in liver IRI. This schema depicts mechanisms underlying the protective effects of Gal\u20109 in liver IRI. Liver IR triggers at first activation of T In conclusion, our data indicate an essential role of Gal\u20109 in the pathophysiology of liver IRI. Administration of exogenous Gal\u20109, such as stable reGal\u20109, decreases liver damage due to IR. This study suggests a previously unrecognized function of Gal\u20109 and a new therapeutic strategy for liver IRI.", "Thus, PTEN is identified as a potential new therapeutic target for reducing IR in Type 2 DM. In the last 20 years, diabetes has sharply increased in all age, sex, and racial/ethnic groups and is only now beginning to level off according to available Center for Disease Control (CDC) data While others have shown that increased TNF\u03b1 leads to IR, it is still unknown how this change occurs. Some proposed mechanisms include decreased INSR, increased lipolysis, decreased insulin-responsive glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), decreased peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor gamma (PPARG), and changes in IRS-1 phosphorylation. TNF\u03b1 phosphorylates the serines in IRS-1 essential for insulin signaling, leading to IR In the current study, we analyzed the effects of various treatments including insulin, TNF\u03b1, 3-hydroxypicolinate vanadium (IV) complex (VO-OHpic), and siRNA PTEN on the levels of PTEN and p-Akt.", "In recent years the increasing role of IR in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) related complications has been taken into account. The aim of this article is to discuss the possible role of IR in pregnancy complicated by T1DM. At the moment, there is no doubt that IR is not only frequently observed in T1DM patients, but also is a separate risk factor of several complications in nonpregnant patients. The role of IR in pregnancy complicated by T1DM has not been widely studied yet. However, data from the studies on different populations showed that IR may predispose to such conditions as miscarriage, preeclampsia and macrosomia. The literature on the role of IR in human pregnancy is relatively rich. Nonetheless, based on the available literature, IR may be proposed as an additional factor modifying pregnancy outcome in woman with T1DM. Therefore, measures that might reduce IR such as good glycemic control and control of weight gain should be recommended for every woman with T1DM, optimally when planning but also throughout the pregnancy", "We used western blot to analyze the phosphorylation status of key molecules of the insulin-signaling pathway, that is, IR, IRS-1, Akt, 42/44 MAP kinases (MAPK; Protein tyrosine phosphatases are negative regulators of insulin signaling. Unlike classical adipocytes, FAP-As were not sensitive to insulin in our We did not find the reason for the lack of induction of IR and IRS-1 phosphorylations, but we can rule out dephosphorylations of these proteins that would be mediated by upregulations of the two important tyrosine phosphatases PTP1B and SHP2. We greatly acknowledge the Plateforme de Cytom\u00e9trie \u2013 Institut de Biologie Valrose, University Nice Sophia Antipolis and CytoMed, the IRCAN Flow Cytometry Facility.", "Sitagliptin (5mg kg(-1)), furosemide (245mg kg(-1)) or their combination were administered orally at 5h post-IR and 2h before euthanasia. Administration of sitagliptin or furosemide ameliorated renal and cardiac deterioration induced by renal IR. Drug treatment significantly inhibited IR-induced elevation of TNF-\u03b1, NF-\u03baB and caspase-3 (P<0.05) in kidney and heart tissue.", "The PA signal from a greenhouse gas (GHG), such as CO Global warming is one of the most serious issues of today and detailed analyses have been carried out on this issue ( We have been involved in a project that helps high-school students understand the IR-absorbing property of GHGs by conducting simple experiments. Although the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer is useful for obtaining detailed information about the characteristics of GHGs ( The PA effect is a transformation of light energy absorbed by a material into acoustic waves ( When an IR-absorbing gas in a closed cell with IR-transmitting windows is irradiated by IR radiation, the gas molecules become vibrationally excited. Therefore, the periodic IR irradiation causes a pressure wave that can be measured with a microphone. The overall experimental system is composed of a light source, a gas cell, a chopper, and an oscilloscope (Figure Schematic diagram of a PA experimental system for IR absorption of gases. The IR radiation emitted by the light source passes through the five-bladed disk producing cyclic modulation of the IR radiation, and then the modulated IR radiation is directed to the gas cell. The pressure variation of the inner gas owing to its IR absorption is detected by the microphone whose signal is sent to the oscilloscope and synchronized with the trigger signal. When the sample gas is flammable, the IR light source should be turned off during the loading. The sample gas is CO This system demonstrates the significant difference in IR absorption between GHGs and non-IR-absorbing gases. Through the following observations, students can confirm that the signal on the oscilloscope screen is due to the PA effect caused by the IR absorption: (1) The period of the signal wave is exactly the same as that of the light modulation and (2) when exchanging the IR light source with a visible light source, such as LED and fluorescent tube, the signal disappears. This system can be applied to qualitative comparison of IR absorption intensity, but it requires attention to whether the sample concentration is suitable for this purpose. The IR absorptivity of a gas in the absorption range of the filter does not contribute to its PA signal. Therefore, a large intensity change means that the major IR absorption of the gas is located in the absorption range. For example, a sapphire plate can be used as a filter that cuts IR radiation in the wavelength range longer than 5.6 \u03bcm. The IR absorptivity of gases is reflected in the loudness of the sound, which is effective as a lab demonstration for students. A low-cost PA system has been developed to provide high-school students with a hands-on learning activity about IR absorption of gases. The PA experiments give reproducible results, which helps students understand that the IR absorptivity of the atmosphere is determined by its minor components, GHGs.", "The molecular mechanism behind light-induced activation of IR is not known. We investigated the in vivo mechanism of IR activation and found that PTP1B activity in dark-adapted retinas was significantly higher than in light-adapted retinas. Conditional deletion of PTP1B in rod photoreceptors by the Cre-loxP system resulted in enhanced IR signaling. Our studies suggest that a defect in the photobleaching of rhodopsin and mutation in rhodopsin gene enhances the activity of PTP1B, and this activated activity could down-regulate the IR survival signaling.", "One study utilized electrospray ionization (ESI)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to determine the relative prevalence of 10 glycerophospholipid classes in normal rat intestine [ C57Bl/6 wild-type mice and Rag-1 Mice were subjected to IR as described previously [ A formalin-fixed, hematoxylin and eosin-stained transverse jejunum section from each mouse was scored for intestinal damage based on a six-tiered scale adapted from Chui Frozen 2 cm jejunal samples were homogenized into a fine powder in liquid nitrogen using a steel mortar and pestle and extracted as described previously with adaptations [ An automated ESI-MS/MS approach was used and data acquisition and analysis carried out at the Kansas Lipidomics Research Center as described previously [ Sequential precursor and neutral loss scans of the extracts produce a series of spectra with each spectrum revealing a set of lipid species containing a common head group fragment. The data suggest that lysoPC and lysoPE rise quickly after IR, with lysoPC becoming significantly higher in the IR group than in the Sham group at 30 min of reperfusion after ischemia ( Rag-1 The formation of PGE To better understand the Ab requirement, we compared the IR-induced expression of Cox-2 mRNA in wild-type and Rag-1 Using ESI-MS/MS, we determined the phospholipid profile of the mid-jejunum of Sham- and IR-treated mice. We showed that IR induces an increase in intestinal lysoPC and free AA in wild-type and Rag-1 Phosphatidylcholine, PI, PS, PE and SM were the main lipid classes present in both wild-type and Rag-1 Previously, there has been limited use of ESI-MS/MS to study lipids in intestinal disease with variable results depending on the disease model. Rag-1 Mid-jejunal lipid extracts from IR treated C57Bl/6 mice were analyzed by ESI-MS/MS. One-way ANOVA with Newman-Keuls post-hoc test was used to determine significance; * indicates significance from Sham treatment where C57Bl/6 mice were subjected to Sham (open bars) or IR (solid bars) with 15 (A) 30 (B) or 120 (C) min reperfusion prior to ESI-MS/MS determination of mol% of lipid analyzed within the intestine. The major lysoPC species which increased in response to IR, lysoPC 16:0, 18:2, 18:1, 18:0, and 20:4 are illustrated. An unpaired t-test determined significant difference ( C57Bl/6 (solid bars) and Rag-1 C57Bl/6 (solid bars) or Rag-1 Total jejunal lipids analyzed in Sham and IR treated C57Bl/6 and Rag-1 Each value is the nmol total lipids per mg tissue analyzed and is a mean of 4 to 8 mice per time point.", "Female MKR mice demonstrate accelerated mammary gland development, enhanced phosphorylation of IR/IGF-IR and Akt in mammary tissue. Normal mammary tissue and breast tumor tissue extracted from diabetic mice reveals markedly increased phosphorylation of the IR/IGF-IR and Akt, whereas ERK1/2 phosphorylation remains largely unaffected. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of the IR/IGF-IR by the small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor BMS-536924 reverses the tumor-promoting effects of diabetes. Taken together, our data provide novel and compelling experimental evidence that (i) T2D, via hyperinsulinemia, accelerates mammary gland development and mammary carcinogenesis, and (ii) the IR and/or the IGF-IR are the major mediators of this effect. Statistical analyses were calculated using the Student's Additional experimental protocols have been described in the In the present work, the transgenic MKR mouse model of T2D was employed ( Little is known about the role of insulin in mammary gland development, but it is well established that IGF-I, which is structurally related to insulin, regulates certain stages of mammary gland development ( At the onset of puberty, the immature mammary gland undergoes rapid growth and differentiation mediated by terminal end buds (TEBs) that cause ductal elongation and branching ( The biological effects of insulin and IGFs are mediated by the structurally related IR and IGF-IR. Both the IR and the IGF-IR bind insulin and IGFs, although each receptor binds its cognate ligand with much higher affinity. In the PyVmT model, the transgene encodes a powerful oncogene (PyVmT) and is controlled by the MMTV promoter, whereby the oncogene is primarily expressed in mammary epithelium ( To study the effect of T2D on tumor development in the MMTV-PyVmT model, cohorts of PyVmT To explore whether hyperinsulinemia underlies the tumor-promoting effects of T2D, we studied IR and IGF-R phosphorylation as well as intracellular signal transduction in PyVmT To study the effect of T2D on breast cancer progression we also employed the syngeneic Met-1 and MCNeuA orthotopic models. ER\u03b1-negative Met-1 and MCNeuA cell lines were originally derived from PyVmT- and Neu-induced mammary tumors, respectively ( To corroborate that hyperinsulinemia, IR/IGF-IR activation and accelerated tumor growth in diabetic animals are mechanistically linked, we employed a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, BMS-536924 ( Numerous epidemiological studies suggest that obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) significantly affect the development of many cancers, including breast cancer. In addition, we show that the signaling axis including insulin, IR/ IGF-IR and the PI3K/Akt pathway is the major pathophysiological mechanism mediating this effect. Indeed, the results of our study demonstrate enhanced IR phosphorylation in mammary and tumor tissue extracted from diabetic mice. Our data, however, also show an increase in IGF-IR phosphorylation suggesting that the tumor-promoting activity of hyperinsulinemia can also be mediated, at least in part, by the IGF-IR. It is well known that at higher concentrations, insulin stimulates the IGF-I receptor ( We also show that IR levels in mammary epithelium of diabetic mice are elevated. The role of the IR in oncogenic transformation and tumorigenesis has not been extensively studied. It is known that IR overexpression results in cellular transformation ( IR- and IGF-IR transduce their intracellular signal through two principal signaling pathways, the MAPK and the PI3K pathway ( Taken together, our data provide compelling evidence that T2D accelerates mammary gland development and breast cancer progression. Furthermore, our data provide the rationale for pharmacological targeting a specific signaling cascade comprising insulin, the IR/IGF-IR and the PI3K/Akt pathway in breast cancer patients with T2D. Effect of pharmacological IR/IGF-IR blockade on Met-1 tumor growth and carbohydrate metabolism in MKR", "Our results using a porcine THVE model suggest that nicorandil inhibits hepatic IR injury.", "In Mre11 Whereas a recent study reported that transient transfection with DNA-PKcs small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences reduced ATM mRNA and protein levels in normal human fibroblasts( While these data demonstrated correlation between CS-mediated apoptosis in the SCC compartment and the GI syndrome in Mre11 Whereas these data indicated a causative engagement of CS activation in Mre11 Whereas genetic Since genetic mutations in two elements of the Mre11 complex, Mre11 The major finding of the present studies is that genetic manipulation of sensors and transducers of DNA damage repair affect GI tract sensitivity Target switching is a recently proposed concept, which indicates that tissues operate a set of primary and secondary targets for stress-induced damage, such as occurs with IR, and that access to secondary targets is engaged when primary targets are repressed genetically or pharmacologically( At present there is no information regarding the trans-regulatory pathways initiated by DNA DSBs that lead to post-translational activation of CS. Such a pathway is, however, assumed, as we have recently found that following IR exposure of HeLa cells, CS is activated in mitochondrial-associated membrane (MAM), an ER-like structure that co-purifies with mitochondria, and serves as a site for lipid synthesis and as a conduit for lipid transfer to the outer mitochondrial membrane.", "We employed comprehensive profiling methods to identify metabolic events associated with IR, while controlling for obesity. We selected 263 non-obese (BMI approximately 24 kg/m After controlling for BMI, commonly accepted risk factors for IR, including circulating fatty acids and inflammatory cytokines, did not discriminate the upper and lower quartiles of insulin sensitivity in either Asian-Indian or Chinese men. Instead, IR was correlated with increased levels of alanine, proline, valine, leucine/isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, glutamate/glutamine and ornithine, and a cluster of branched-chain and related amino acids identified by principal components analysis. These changes were not due to increased protein intake by individuals in the upper quartile of IR. Increased abdominal adiposity and leptin, and decreased adiponectin and IGF-binding protein 1 were also correlated with IR. These findings demonstrate that perturbations in amino acid homeostasis, but not inflammatory markers or NEFAs, are associated with IR in individuals of relatively low body mass. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that the principal component (cluster of metabolites) most strongly associated with IR (as measured by HOMA index) was one comprising branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and related metabolites [ The foregoing summary highlights the need for deeper understanding of metabolic, hormonal and inflammatory factors contributing to the development of IR. A particular opportunity may reside in studies of development of IR in Asian populations. Furthermore, we chose to study only Chinese and Asian-Indian men, as these were the ethnic groups that show the greatest differences in IR in our population [ Insulin sensitivity was measured by HOMA [ Venous blood was drawn and collected in plain and fluoride oxalate tubes in the morning following a 10 h overnight fast. Using a comprehensive metabolic profiling approach, we have found a clear association between a subset of amino acids and IR in Chinese and Asian-Indian individuals living in Singapore. Central adiposity accompanied by reduced lean body mass is a condition that has been termed \u2018sarcopenic obesity\u2019 [ Downregulation of the growth hormone axis has also been implicated in the link between IR and sarcopenia. Increases in NEFAs have been reported in obese and insulin-resistant individuals in many prior studies, leading to extensive studies on the potential \u2018lipotoxic\u2019 effects of these agents in development of IR [ Several limitations of the study should be noted. Third, HOMA is an imprecise method for assessing IR. In conclusion, significant evidence supports the role of NEFAs and inflammation in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated IR. Our study complements this knowledge, by showing that when IR develops at relatively low body weight it is no longer associated with NEFA and inflammation but instead with a metabolic signature of elevated BCAAs and related metabolites. It remains to be determined if the rise in BCAAs and related metabolites is an early manifestation of IR caused by other factors, or is actually one of the primary causes of the insulin-resistant state. Support for a primary role of amino acids includes recent studies in animals showing that feeding of BCAAs causes IR, particularly in the context of a high-fat diet [ The studies reported in this article were supported by a Khoo Discovery Project Award from the Duke-National University of Singapore Graduate Medical School (to E. S. Tai), and by NIH grant PO1DK58398 (to C. B. Newgard).", "Human WRN was implicated in a G2 cell cycle checkpoint, in response to the inhibition of chromosomal decatenation Here we exploit the (A) Schematic representation of a gonad arm in an adult The In this study, we further explore DNA damage response defects associated with WRN-1 in the To probe activation of the DNA damage checkpoint in mitotic To ask why phosphorylation of CHK1 Ser345 is detected in some cells of the proliferating region after UV treatment but not after IR treatment, we labeled S-phase cells with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Adult worms were exposed to BrdU for 30 min and irradiated with UV or IR, followed by incubation of 1 h in the absence of BrdU. We have observed normal cell cycle regulation after HU- or IR-treatment of (A) After DNA replication inhibition by hydroxyurea (HU), ATM-CHK2 activation is induced in the downstream of ATR in mammals, in addition to ATR-CHK1 activation We found that in contrast to wild type, the cell cycle arrest was significantly alleviated in Our results suggest that WRN-1 is an upstream component of the signaling pathway that mediates IR-dependent cell cycle arrest.", "This pathway is functionally important for photoreceptor survival as deletion of IR and one of the isoforms of Akt (Akt2) resulted in stress-induced photoreceptor degeneration. In this study, we characterized these two phosphatases in the retina and examined the role of IR, PI3K, and Akt signaling on the activity of PHLPP and PHLPPL. As a positive control, we also cloned the PH domain of Akt-1 which is known to bind to PI3K generated phosphoinositides ( We previously reported that light stress induced the activation of IR, PI3K and Akt and the activation of this pathway is neuroprotective ( To investigate if PHLPP or PHLPPL activity was modulated directly by Akt, we cloned full length \u03b1 PHLPP and full length PHLPPL as FLAG tagged protein. We have previously reported that only Akt2 is essential for stress-induced photoreceptor survival and maintenance, although all three Akt isoforms are present in photoreceptor cells ( Since PHLPP and PHLPPL are able to dephosphorylate Akt, and Akt is a downstream effector of IR/PI3K pathway, we examined whether IR-signaling pathway regulates the activity of PHLPP and PHLPPL. The contradictory results from the In summary, our results demonstrate that activation of IR signaling inhibits the activities of both PHLPP and PHLPPL.", "Its etiology and the role of IR and obesity in PCOS are not fully understood.

Their findings offer a novel perspective on the long-cryptic nature of Image overlay of transmission electron microscopy, light microscopy, and X-ray fluorescence microprobe analyses of Exposing cells to IR generates a range of potentially harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species (ROS). To understand the nature of manganese protection in cells, the researchers then irradiated IR-sensitive and IR-resistant bacteria and compared their levels of oxidative protein damage.", "AKI because of liver IR is characterized by early renal endothelial cell apoptosis and impaired vascular integrity with subsequent neutrophil infiltration, proximal tubule necrosis/inflammation, and filamentous (F) actin disintegration. We tested whether selective renal overexpression of human A(1) adenosine receptors (huA(1)AR) protects against both liver and kidney injury sustained after liver IR. Mice were subjected to liver IR or to sham surgery 48 h after unilateral intrarenal injection of lentivirus encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or EGFP-huA(1)AR. Mice injected with EGFP-huA(1)AR lentivirus were protected against hepatic IR-induced liver and kidney injury with reduced necrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis, and better preserved F-actin and vascular permeability compared with mice injected with EGFP lentivirus. Importantly, we show that removing the EGFP-huA(1)AR lentivirus-injected kidney before hepatic ischemia abolished both renal and hepatic protection after liver IR showing that the overexpression of huA(1)AR in the injected kidney has a crucial role in protecting the kidney and liver after liver IR. Therefore, our findings show that protecting the kidney reduces liver IR injury and selective overexpression of cytoprotective A(1)ARs in the kidney leads to protection of both liver and kidney after hepatic IR.", "The results of this work showed a rise in the content of monounsaturated fatty acids (18:1 n-9) and a reduction in the level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (20:4 n-6) in plasma of rats with experimental IR. The NSE administration to obese rats with IR restored the content of mono- and polyunsaturated FFA, increased HDL cholesterol content and reduced LDL cholesterol level. In addition, the IR rats treated with NSE showed normalization in the serum TNF\u03b1 level. Our results showed the restoration of plasma lipid profile under NSE administration in rats with obesity-induced IR. Considering the fact that plasma lipid composition displays the lipid metabolism in general, the NSE actions may play a significant role in the prevention of IR-associated complications.", "On the other hand, several epidemiological studies support the association between RA and IR, with the latter being linked to systemic inflammatory markers, including C reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Likewise, the association between RA and IR, and its role on the different characteristics of the disease, such as duration, activity, and treatment with glucocorticoids has not been well defined.", "For example, cardiac surgery, stroke, tourniquet application for orthopedic surgery, organ transplantation, and restoration of shock can cause IR injury. In addition, IR stress triggers necrotic or apoptotic cell death. Understanding the mechanisms of IR injury may provide therapeutic targets to decrease IR injury and improve outcomes in clinical settings (e.g., coronary or cerebral vascular disease). Some anesthetic agents, including volatile or intravenous anesthetics, are known to have a protective effect against IR injury. The guidelines of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend volatile anesthetic agents during non-cardiac surgery for the maintenance of general anesthesia in hemodynamically stable patients at risk for myocardial ischemia [ Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the protective effect of volatile anesthetics against cardiac IR injury. IR can increase neutrophil adhesion to vascular endothelial cells, which contributes to reperfusion injury. Volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane and sevoflurane can reduce the reperfusion-induced adhesion of neutrophils at clinically relevant doses [ Volatile anesthetics are known to diminish cerebral IR injury. Neuroprotective effects of volatile anesthetics have been shown in various Numerous studies have shown that various anesthetic agents can decrease cerebral IR injury.", "The mice were maintained for 1 week prior to the experiments and randomly assigned to the following groups: 1) control (n = 18); 2) CA (n = 18); 3) IR (n = 27); and 4) CA + IR (n = 27). The animals were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility and were fed a normal diet and autoclaved water Abdominal IR was performed using X-Rad320, as shown in the photo. CA (10 mg/kg per dose) was intraperitoneally administered to C3H mice at 24 h and 1 h before and 24, 48 and 72 h after IR. The mice were euthanized at 6 h after IR for apoptosis detection and at 3.5 days after IR for crypt survival assays ( A 10-cm segment of the jejunal intestine was collected, fixed in formalin, and embedded in paraffin wax. HUVECs were treated with 5 \u03bcM CA before IR with 10 Gy for 3 h. Each well was seeded with 4.5\u00d710 Viable caner cells were plated into each 60-mm culture dish and allowed to grow following the CA (2.5 \u03bcM) and IR (0\u20136 Gy) treatments at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO Mouse colon cancer CT26 (purchased from ATCC) cells (1 x 10 All values are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). To investigate the effects of CA on the intestine, we reduced radiation-induced bone marrow injury using localized abdominal IR. We exposed the abdomens of mice to 12.5 Gy IR under anesthesia using an Xrad-320, which is designed to localize IR in experimental animals ( We then measured the effects of CA on crypt survival in jejunum samples collected 3.5 days after abdominal IR at 12.5 Gy. After 12.5 Gy IR, remarkable jejunal crypt loss, villi shortening, and vacuole and erythrocyte loss in the villus epithelium and lamina propria were observed ( To investigate the long-term effect of CA on radiation enteropathy, we evaluated the survival of mice for 30 days after IR localized to the intestine. The loss of body weight began on the first day after IR; the animals reached their minimum body weights after 7 days, after which they slowly recovered until 21 days after IR ( Because systemic CA treatment effectively protected the intestine according to the histological analyses, we sought to confirm the protective effects of CA Because CA effectively protected endothelial cells in the mouse intestine, we examined its effect on endothelial cells. Following treatment with cycloheximide (CHX; 10 \u03bcg/ml), control cells exhibited rapid HSF1 protein degradation, whereas CA-treated cells exhibited prolonged HSF1 stability ( To consider whether CA has protective effects against cancer, we assessed cancer cell proliferation and colony formation assays following CA and IR treatments in three human cancer cell lines. Neither CA alone nor the combined treatment with CA and IR altered cell proliferation or the surviving fraction of cancer cells ( Due to concerns regarding radiation exposure after an accident or from terrorist activity, research interest has increased for developing medical countermeasures against the radiation-induced gastrointestinal (GI) tract injury [ We investigated the effects of CA on radiation enteropathy with a localized abdominal IR model because CA possesses anti-inflammatory activity, which is effective for treating ulcerative colitis and intestinal inflammatory disorders [ To evaluate the acute effects of CA on intestinal radiation injury, we measured apoptotic cell death at 6 h after IR because the early wave of apoptosis caused by radiation occurs at 3\u20136 h after IR [ In this study, we found that CA significantly inhibited apoptotic cell death, which was blocked in the absence of HSF1 or HSP70 ( To assess the protective effects of CA on cancer, we tested its effects on human cancer cell lines and CT26-bearing mice. The induction of HSF1 by CA and its transcriptional regulation of HSP70 protected epithelial and endothelial cell death and endothelial cell function from IR. Masson\u2019s trichrome staining was performed to detect collagen deposition in jejuna harvested from CA-treated mice at 30 days after 12.5 Gy abdominal IR. C3H mice were exposed to 8 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) following CA treatment compared with IR group. The animals received CA (10 mg/kg) at 24 and 1 h before and 24, 48, and 72 h after 8 Gy IR. The IR group was injected with same volume of vehicle (5% DMSO in saline). Following 8 Gy TBI, death of the animals occurred beginning at 5 days after IR, and 100% mortality was reached within 10 days. In the CA+IR group, radiation-induced mortality also began at 5 days after IR but ended at 13 days, and the mean survival time was prolonged by 30 h compared with the IR group (201 \u00b1 15 h in IR group vs. 231 \u00b1 13 h in the CA + IR group, (TIF) Click here for additional data file.", "An in vitro dose-dependent and time-dependent cytotoxic effect of DA, Z and IR on PNT2 cells ( Additional effort should be carried out to develop adhesives, which would reduce the release of hazardous substances; since toxic effects are similar to that reported by other agents whose clinical use is controlled by the health authorities. Tests were carried out to confirm the absence of - MTT test To analyze for the effects of DA (With- and Without-O2), Z and IR on PNT2 cell viability and survival, we used the 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay for 24 or 48 hours. After treatment at the above mentioned incubation doses of DA, Z and IR, and for the stated durations, supplemented growth medium and 50 \u00b5l of MMT (5 mg/ml) were added to each well in the 96 well plates and the micro plates were further incubated in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C for 4 hours. In consonance with others authors, our results show that the cytotoxicity of dentin adhesive systems is higher at 24-48 hours after placement ( Some authors have proposed that cell culture toxicity data are highly model dependent and that internationally standardized test protocols for toxicity screening of dental materials in line with the existing standards are clearly needed to obtain comparable results ( The genotoxicity test has been described in cultured human lymphocytes exposed to radiation and is considered the ideal assay for measuring chromosomal damage and quantify the genotoxic capacity of such substances ( In the present study, human prostate epithelial cells were utilized due to their consideration as sensitive to radiotherapy techniques; also due to the use of zoledronic acid in bone metastases in human prostate tumours, which in previous research allowed us to describe the different systemic responses to isolated or combined treatments using either one agent alone or both jointly (Z + IR). As such, the results we have determined regarding the toxicity of dental adhesives (DA) would allow preliminary assessments to be made on their effects on the human organism as well as to establish a comparison on the known toxic effects induced by IR and Z. According to Hagio We determined greater cytotoxic and genotoxic effects for DAs than those determined for a range of IR doses and of high doses of Z.Both agents (Z and RI) are subject to strict health and safety controls in terms of their use and handling due to their known toxicity.", "Sixty Wistar rats were divided into 6 groups: control, IR, PC, EA-control, IR and administration of EA (IR/EA) and PC and administration of EA (PC/EA). The IR, PC, IR/EA and PC/EA groups underwent 60 min of infrarenal aortic cross-clamping. In 3 of the groups, the animals were treated with EA (EA-control, IR/EA and PC/EA groups) as well. Inhibition of GST by EA augmented the IR damage.", "In line with the in vivo data, pharmacological GCS inhibition by Genz123346 also increases IR levels as well as IR phosphorylation in insulin-stimulated hypothalamic cells. In addition to studies suggesting that simple gangliosides like GM3 regulate peripheral IR signaling, this work suggests that complex neuronal gangliosides also modulate hypothalamic IR signaling and protein levels. For example, the complex ganglioside GD1a interacts dynamically with the IRs on adult hypothalamic neurons.", "IR was determined through the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) mathematical model, using fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and insulin. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the association between demographic information, clinical characteristics and laboratory results, and IR. 75 (34.2 %) [95 % confidence interval (CI) 28.9\u201340.9] HIV-patients on HAART showed IR. In the multivariate analysis, the factors associated with IR were age \u2265 46 years (Prevalence ratio = 2.767, 95 % CI 1.325 to 5.780) and greater body mass index (BMI) (Prevalence ratio = 1.148, 95 % CI 1.054 to 1.250). The prevalence of IR was 34.2 %. Factors associated with IR were age and BMI. We did not find any significant association between IR and protease inhibitors (PI), which may be explained by the small number of patients using PI as part of their HAART regimen included in our study. The antiretroviral drugs most frequently associated with the development of lipodystrophy and IR are the PIs such as lopinavir, ritonavir and nelfinavir [ IR, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are part of a plurimetabolic syndrome associated with HAART, thus, the detection of this syndrome should be systematic. Guidelines recommend testing FPG at the time of HIV diagnosis, before initiating HAART, and every 6\u201312 months during treatment [ The HOMA mathematical model is a clinical and epidemiological tool used to estimate IR based on plasma levels of fasting glucose and insulin [ The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia and of the Hospital Nacional Cayetano Heredia. The presence of IR was determined by the HOMA mathematical model using the following formula: [Insulin (\u03bcU/ml \u00d7 glucose (mmol/L)/22.5]. We defined IR as a HOMA-IR value \u2265 2.1. This cutoff point was determined in a previous study conducted at the Hospital Nacional Cayetano Heredia in subjects with normal glucose tolerance tests [ Continuous variables were summarized using means and standard deviations, and comparisons between groups with and without IR were made using the Student\u2019s The analysis was performed with the statistical program Stata SE version 11 (College Station, TX). MS was found in 26.9 % subjects and was more prevalent in the IR group (44.0 % Comparison of metabolic syndrome and its components in HIV-infected patients on HAART with and without IR Abbreviations: Hyperglycemia was found in 103 (47 %) subjects, 9 (4.1 %) of them had serum glucose >125 mg/dl. The prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-C was 48.4 % and 57.5 % respectively (Table Subjects with IR were older, had higher BMI, and were more likely to have hyperglycemia, central obesity and diastolic hypertension. With regard to the lipid profile, although the patients with IR had higher triglycerides levels, no significant differences were found when the variable was categorized as hypertriglyceridemia. In multivariate analysis, the factors associated with IR were age \u226546 years (PR = 2.767, 95 % CI 1.325 to 5.780) and greater BMI (PR = 1.148, 95 % CI 1.054 to 1.250) (Table Multivariate logistic regression analysis for IR in HIV-infected patients on HAART Abbreviations: In our study, the prevalence of IR was 34 %, two times higher than that of the non-HIV-infected population Through bivariate analysis, we found the following variables to be associated with IR: age, diastolic blood pressure, weight, BMI, abdominal circumference and FGP. All of these variables are components traditionally associated with the development of IR in the general population [ In the multivariate analysis, through a logistic regression model using the variables that were significant in the bivariate analysis, we found that patients older than 46 years have almost three times more risk of IR compared with younger subjects. Similarly, we found an increased risk of IR with higher BMI; for each unit increase in BMI, the risk of IR increased by 15 %. The prevalence of MS in our series was 27 %, similar to the prevalence reported in American and Latin American series in patients with HIV infection [ We found an alarmingly high prevalence of hyperglycemia (47 %), higher than that reported in other studies of HIV patients on HAART (38 %) [ The prevalence of hypertension was 3.7 %, lower than that found in a previous study (16 %) [ The study\u2019s limitations were the lack of a control group of HIV-uninfected subjects to define a more precise HOMA-IR\u2019s cutoff point and the clinical evaluation of lipodystrophy. These variables have been considered factors associated with IR in this specific population. found a significant association between a high CD4 count and IR [ In conclusion, this study shows a significant percentage of HIV-infected patients on HAART present IR. Factors associated with IR were age and BMI. Since these patients have a high frequency of dyslipidemia and tobacco consumption, the detection of IR and its risk factors will allow for the assessment of each patient\u2019s metabolic risk and will also promote addressing modifiable risk factors to prevent the development of T2DM and cardiovascular disease. We did not find any significant association between IR and protease inhibitors, which may be explained by the small number of patients using PI as part of their HAART regimen included in our study. The use of HOMA-IR in these patients will require further longitudinal studies in order to demonstrate its usefulness in early predicting diabetes or IGT in this population.", "We therefore hypothesized that IKK\u03b1 could participate in the kidney repair after IR injury and have used a mouse model of acute kidney injury (AKI) to test this. We conclude that IKK\u03b1 is involved in kidney recovery and regeneration through the Treg cells that can produce IL10, which might be a potential therapeutic target that can be used to promote kidney repair after IR injury. Although ischemia leads to extensive epithelial cell death in the proximal tubule, after IR injury and subsequent inflammation, the impaired kidney often heals. Here, the authors use a mouse model of IR injury to investigate the role of IKK\u03b1 in kidney repair after IR injury. By showing that IKK\u03b1 mediates kidney repair and regeneration by inducing the infiltration of Treg cells and the subsequent production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10, these findings identify potential therapeutic targets that might help to promote kidney repair after IR injury and provide novel clues for both preventing and treating IR injury. On day 1 after IR injury, kidneys showed signs of severe tubular pathology (dilated tubules, casts) in the outer medulla and cortex when compared with sham-treated mice ( To investigate the potential effects of IKK\u03b1 on the renal repair mechanism after IR injury, the expression of both total and phosphorylated IKK\u03b1 (p-IKK\u03b1) were analyzed by western blotting. Consistent with the expression of IKK\u03b1, the expression of NIK, p52, p-p52, RelB and p-RelB was also detected in surviving TECs in repair phase by immunofluorescence or western blotting ( Inflammation resolution and TEC proliferation are two hallmarks of kidney recovery after IR injury. The vector was used as a control 2 weeks before IR, and cohorts of mice were killed on day 3. To investigate whether intrarenal delivery of IKK\u03b1-shRNA could downregulate IKK\u03b1 expression after IR injury, we harvested the kidneys for protein isolation. Expression of IKK\u03b1 was dramatically reduced after GV118-GFP-IKK\u03b1 shRNA intrarenal delivery, compared with wild-type mice after IR injury ( The ability of Treg cells to traffic to the areas of inflammation and their ability to suppress innate immunity in kidney IR injury has been demonstrated previously ( Growing evidence indicates that IL10 protects the kidney from IR injury by invoking both anti-inflammatory and proliferative responses ( The above data indicate that IL10 and Treg cells might mediate kidney repair by promoting inflammation regression and TEC proliferation. We next investigated whether Treg cells are the major source of IL10 following kidney IR injury. Treg cells from spleens of wild-type mice were isolated, purified and injected intravenously to To further emphasize the importance of IKK\u03b1 expression in TECs for infiltration of Treg cells in the kidney recovery phase, we induced IR injury in IKK\u03b1-null (genotype IKK\u03b1 IDO is a tryptophan-metabolizing enzyme, the expression of which requires noncanonical NF\u03baB signaling and has several physiological activities, such as suppressing activated T cells. By contrast, kidneys on day 3 after IR injury had intense and diffuse IDO staining within the tubule interstitium. As shown in Inflammation resolution and TEC proliferation are two hallmarks in the kidney recovery phase following IR injury ( To allow tissue recovery in sterile tissue injuries, a number of counter regulatory mechanisms exist to prevent the immune reaction from becoming pathologically excessive. These mechanisms include limiting the activation of surviving TECs and infiltrated immune cells ( Using a unilateral IR injury model, we found that proliferation and differentiation of surviving TECs begins 24 h after kidney IR injury. Silencing or knocking down IKK\u03b1 in TECs worsened histological damage and delayed tubular regeneration on day 3 after IR injury. Both the early and late phases of kidney IR injury are characterized by infiltration of T lymphocytes, which, like macrophages and DCs, can facilitate injury but also promote repair after IR injury ( Treg cells were initially identified as CD4 In this experiment, using flow cytometry technology, we observed that kidney Treg cell numbers were significantly infiltrated 3 days after IR injury. As expected, increased kidney IR injury was observed in Despite suffering from passive injury, the TECs are involved in the inflammatory response to IR injury in the kidney ( Recently, studies have demonstrated that the noncanonical NF\u03baB pathway induces the IDO-mediated expression of DCs by differentiated Treg cells, acting as an activator of the noncanonical NFkB pathway ( In this study, we first show that the expression of IDO is proportional to the number of infiltrated Treg cells in the recovery phase following kidney IR injury. We reveal that surviving TECs are the source of IDO production, which might be beneficial to kidney repair and inflammation regression in the repair phase after IR injury. Whole-cell lysates were then prepared and immunoblotted for IKK\u03b1 expression as described elsewhere ( Kidney tissues were obtained from mice for each treatment groups on days 1, 3, and 7 after mice IR induction (see above), respectively.", "This study evaluated the effects of tramadol on the heart as a remote organ after acute hindlimb IR. From the histological and biochemical perspectives, treatment with tramadol alleviated the myocardial injuries induced by skeletal muscle IR in this experimental model. IR injury is a serious clinical problem that occurs in many diseases and surgeries, such as limb orthopedic surgery, organ transplantation, cardiopulmonary bypass, and hypovolaemic shock Various investigators have demonstrated that the opioid pathway is involved in tissue preservation during hypoxia or ischemia, and this protection is mediated via the delta opioid receptor Tramadol is a narcotic-like pain reliever drug as it has an unusual mechanism of action involving opioid, noradrenaline, and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) systems of analgesia. Although it does not cause respiratory depression, the problems of nausea when used in clinically effective analgesic doses for severe pain and the risk of intra-operative awareness may represent significant disadvantages of tramadol In the past few years, the administration of tramadol was shown to protect against IR injuries in local and remote organs Thirty healthy mature male Wistar rats weighing 250\u2013300 g were purchased from the Pasteur Institute of Iran. Group II (IR group) was subjected to IR. Group III (IR + tramadol group) was subjected to IR. IR: ischemia reperfusion; and IR + T: ischemia reperfusion + tramadol. IR: ischemia reperfusion and IR + T: ischemia reperfusion + tramadol. IR: ischemia reperfusion and IR + T: ischemia reperfusion + tramadol. IR: ischemia reperfusion and IR + T: ischemia reperfusion + tramadol. Muscle cells with pyknotic nuclei were stained more deeply with eosin in the area of coagulative necrosis (hematoxylin and eosin staining, bar = 100 \u03bcm) Representative photomicrograph of myocardium in the ischemia reperfusion + tramadol group showing nearly normal structure (hematoxylin and eosin staining, bar = 100 \u03bcm) The local and remote consequences of limb IR injury continue to be a serious clinical problem for general vascular surgeons, interventional radiologists, and cardiologists. Reperfusion of the skeletal muscle causes activation and adhesion of polymorphonuclear neutrophils, with the release of proinflammatory substances and the formation of free radicals, which include nitrogen-derived reactive nitrogen species and oxygen-derived reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide, peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals As far as we know, there are only a few reports demonstrating remote myocardial injury following skeletal muscle IR injury. Previous studies have shown that the use of tramadol after IR in animals attenuated the oxidative injuries. A recent study showed that ischemia for 2 h was sufficient to obtain a considerable degree of injury in skeletal muscles and the intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg tramadol prevented this deleterious effect In our study, the antioxidant potential of tramadol was investigated using MDA, GPx, CAT, and SOD contents in myocardial tissue following acute hindlimb IR. The results of this study confirmed that the administration of tramadol significantly decreased myocardial injuries induced by hindlimb IR. IR: ischemia reperfusion and IR + T: ischemia reperfusion + tramadol.", "5 mmol/kg pre-LiCl significantly increased IR-stimulated reduce of Bcl-2/Bax and p-CREB/CREB.", "In order to determine whether exercise training had differential effects on IS versus IR, comparisons between pre and post-training were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA (RMANOVA). (A) VO2max is significantly decreased in IR versus IS at baseline and following training (IS versus IR Subjects participated in an aerobic exercise training protocol consisting of cycle ergometer, 3 days per week for 12 weeks. VO2max was lower in IR subjects at baseline and following training (Fig. Skeletal muscle Angpt2, TIE1, and TIE2 gene expression did not differ between IR and IS subjects at baseline, whereas Angpt1 mRNA was correlated with several indicators of less robust muscle metabolic function. (A) Angpt1 gene expression is positively correlated with BMI ( Furthermore, skeletal muscle Angpt1 gene expression was elevated in IR compared to IS participants at baseline and following training (Fig. (A) Angpt1 gene expression is increased in IR versus IS at both baseline and following training (IS versus IR Subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were obtained before and after the aerobic exercise training protocol, and lectin staining was used to quantify vessel density. A representative photomicrograph of adipose lectin staining is shown in Figure Aerobic training induces angiogenesis in adipose tissue of IS, but not IR subjects. Changes in adipose gene expression following training are sufficient to induce angiogenesis in IS, but not IR subjects. Thus, exercise training induced vascularization and pro-angiogenic gene expression in the skeletal muscle of both IR and IS subjects. Conversely, exercise training increased adipose tissue vessel density in IS subjects, but not IR subjects. In this study, we investigated whether aerobic exercise training would induce a normal angiogenic response in the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue of IR participants, and whether chronic changes in vessel density and gene expression are associated with improved fitness and metabolic health. Toward this end, IR and IS subjects completed 12 weeks of cycle ergometer training. Following exercise training, IR subjects displayed no improvement in S Following training, mean muscle Angpt1 gene expression decreased and mean Angpt2 gene expression increased, and the magnitude of these changes did not differ between IR and IS. To our knowledge, we are the first to examine whether exercise training induces angiogenesis in healthy human adipose tissue, and whether the adipose response differs between IR and IS subjects.", "Values of fasting serum triglycerides, serum insulin, plasma glucose, and HOMA-IR were logarithmically transformed prior to statistical analyses, and their effect sizes (\u03b2) are presented as the increase/decrease in percent.", "In mice, haploinsufficiency of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R Using a number of complementary gene-modified mice with reduced IGF-1R at a whole-body level and specifically in EC, and complementary studies in EC in vitro, we examined the effect of changing IGF-1R/IR stoichiometry on EC insulin sensitivity and NO bioavailability. Mice with whole-body haploinsufficiency of IGF-1R ( To examine the effect of changing IGF-1R:IR stoichiometry on endothelial responses, we bred male IGF-1R To generate mice with endothelium-specific deficiency of IGF-1R, we used mice carrying a floxed IGF-1R allele (IGF-1R Blood was sampled from tail vein. Glucose, insulin, and IGF-1 tolerance tests were performed by blood sampling after an intraperitoneal injection of glucose (1 mg/g; Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, U.K.), human recombinant insulin (0.75 units/kg, Actrapid; Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark), or human recombinant IGF-1 (0.75 \u03bcg/g; GroPep, Adelaide, Australia), as previously described ( Vasomotor function was assessed in aortic rings as previously described ( Endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity was determined by conversion of [ eNOS, peNOS, IR, and IGF-1R protein expression was quantified in aorta and ECs using Western blotting ( Primary cells were lysed in extraction buffer containing (in mmol/L, unless otherwise specified) 50 HEPES, 120 NaCl, 1 MgCl mRNA was isolated using a commercial kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), and the levels of IGF-1R and IR mRNA quantified using real-time quantitative PCR (e.g., Primary ECs were isolated from lungs by immunoselection with CD146 antibody\u2013coated magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech, Surrey, U.K.), as previously reported ( The following validated oligonucleotides were synthesized from Sigma-Aldrich (SASI_Hs01_00126194 HUMAN NM_000875). Haploinsufficiency of IGF-1R at a whole-body level leads to increased levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated IR, increased insulin-mediated NO production, and serine phosphorylation of eNOS in ECs. We have previously demonstrated that IR Deletion of IGF-1R in mice with haploinsufficiency of IR (IR To examine the specific effects of reducing IGF-1R expression on basal serine phosphorylation and activation of eNOS in response to insulin, we used siRNA-mediated knockdown of IGF-1R. siRNA-treated HUVEC had a significant reduction in IGF-1R but no change in IR ( siRNA-mediated knockdown of IGF-1R in HUVECs reproduces the in vivo scenario, increasing EC insulin-mediated eNOS activation. To examine the therapeutic potential of manipulating IGF-1R numbers, we generated mice with whole-body haploinsufficiency of the IR and IGF-1R. We have previously demonstrated substantial abnormalities of EC function in IR A well defined series of steps occur in the arterial wall during the development of atherosclerosis ( eNOS activity is regulated at multiple different levels (for review see Insulin and IGF-1, via activation of their receptors, have been shown to increase levels of serine-phosphorylated eNOS in vivo ( In this mouse, previously shown to be protected against oxidative stress ( IGF-1R To separate the systemic effects of IGF-1R from the EC effects, we generated mice with different levels of IGF-1R using the Tie-2 promoter to direct gene expression principally to the endothelium. It is well established that IR and IGF-1R can heterodimerize to form insulin-resistant hybrid receptors ( Insulin-resistant humans have a significant reduction in cell surface IR ( An increase in hybrid receptors is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes and obesity ( The role of hyperglycemia was also examined by this group ( In summary we have demonstrated in complementary in vivo and in vitro models that IGF-1R is an important negative regulator of insulin sensitivity in the endothelium.", "While IR has recently been found to be involved in apoptosis, p53 induction or apoptosis mediated through IR signaling activation has never been documented. Here, we report that the IR signaling pathway, particularly the IR-MEK pathway, mediates biological and biochemical changes in p53 and apoptosis in tumor cells. Specifically, natural compound penta-O-galloyl-\u03b1-D: -glucopyranose (\u03b1-PGG), a previously characterized IR signaling activator, induced apoptosis in RKO cells without significantly affecting its normal counterpart FHC cells. Importantly, \u03b1-PGG's ability to elevate p53 was diminished by IR inhibitor and IR-siRNA, suggesting a non-conventional role of IR as being involved in p53 induction. Further studies revealed that \u03b1-PGG activated MEK, a downstream signaling factor of IR. All these results suggested that \u03b1-PGG induced p53, Bax, and apoptosis through the IR-MEK signaling pathway. The unique activity of \u03b1-PGG, a novel IR phosphorylation and apoptosis inducer, may offer a new therapeutic strategy for eliciting apoptotic signal and inhibiting cancer growth.", "Compared with controls, rats with IR showed increased levels of fasting blood sugar and serum insulin, by 95% and 67%, respectively (all P<0.01), and glycogen synthesis and glucose transport activity of the soleus decreased by 54% and 55% (all P<0.01). ADM administration ameliorated the induced IR and myocardial hypertrophy. Our results showed upregulation of endogenous ADM during fructose-induced IR and the protective effect of ADM on fructose-induced IR and concomitant cardiovascular hypertrophy probably by its antioxidant effect, which suggests that ADM could be an endogenous protective factor in IR.", "Therefore, in this study, we aim to investigate whether pitavastatin treatment attenuates myocardial IR injury via regulating oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAkt) endothelial nitric oxide synthase (e-NOS) pathways. Pitavastatin at a dose of 0.32 and 0.64 mg/kg significantly improved cardiac function as evidenced by the normalization of the mean arterial pressure, heart rate, \u00b1LVdP/dtmax, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure as compared with the IR control. Morphological assessments of the IR-challenged myocardium showed that 0.32 and 0.64 mg/kg of pitavastatin decrease myocardial necrosis and inflammatory changes. Thus, pitavastatin reduced IR-induced infarction and dysfunction via the augmentation of endogenous antioxidant, suppression of I\u03baB kinase/nuclear factor-kappa B, activation of pAkt-e-NOS, and/or decreased NO inactivation and apoptosis.", "To further explore this hypothesis, we imposed a condition of increased lipid oxidation demand by exercise with similar intensity and total volume (50% VO In the present study, we estimated skeletal muscle mitochondrial density by maximal CS activity, a widely accepted marker of mitochondrial density ( The hypothesis that reduced muscle mitochondrial density has a critical role on impaired lipid oxidation, lipid accumulation and IR is mainly based on studies reporting lower fasting lipid oxidation in the resting state in individuals with obesity-associated IR ( The metabolic challenge imposed on muscle mitochondria under resting conditions is minimal. Then, it is unlikely that decreased mitochondrial density can be severe enough to impair resting lipid oxidation ( Impaired muscle mitochondrial density may not necessarily lead to impaired lipid oxidation and IR. In conclusion, the hypothesis that impaired muscle mitochondrial density leads to impaired reliance on lipid oxidation and eventually increased muscle lipid accumulation and IR needs more assessments of lipid balance using metabolic chambers over days.", "Nonetheless, in two p53-deficient SLGC lines examined \u03b3IR-induced apoptosis even correlated with EGF/FGF-induced proliferation and mitotic catastrophe. In a line containing CD133-positive and -negative stem-like cells, the CD133-positive cells proliferated faster and underwent more \u03b3IR-induced mitotic catastrophe. Our results suggest the importance of delayed apoptosis, associated mitotic catastrophe, and cellular proliferation for \u03b3IR-induced death of p53-deficient SLGCs. However, all lines differentiated upon exposure to vitamin A (Figure Apoptosis can occur immediately after irradiation as interphase death (\"fast apoptosis\"), after G2 arrest, or after one or several cell divisions (\"late apoptosis\") [ For GBM4, GBM10, and GBM22, we could not detect significantly higher apoptosis in the FBS cultures (Figure DNA DSBs - the major lethal lesion induced by \u03b3IR - can be assessed by visualizing histone H2AX phosphorylation at serine 139 (\u03b3H2AX). Lower \u03b3IR-induced \u03b3H2AX signals have been reported in CSC-like cells compared to non-CSCs at 24 h (residual signal) but not early after irradiation [ We have made detailed kinetic analyses of \u03b3IR-induced \u03b3H2AX signals. As shown in Figure Activated p53 is one of the most important regulators and executors of the DNA damage response, and blocked apoptosis is often related to problems in p53 activation [ Using inhibitor experiments, EGF and FGF-2 signaling have both been shown to affect DSB repair, cell survival and apoptosis, as well as cellular resistance to \u03b3IR [ As shown in Figure Conversely, a 72 h (but not a 16 h) withdrawal of EGF and FGF from GBM4 SLGCs which did not differentiate under these conditions, strongly increased \u03b3IR-induced \u03b3H2AX (Figure The specificity of recombinant EGF and FGF-2 and the role of EGF/FGF-2 signaling in DNA damage repair were confirmed by experiments with antibodies blocking the ligand-binding domain of EGF receptor (EGFR) and the main receptor of FGF-2 (wich is FGFR-1, [ Although mitotic catastrophe is a known major cause of cell death in radio- or chemotherapy [ Most cells undergoing mitotic catastrophe are destined to die. Seven days after irradiation, we found a clear reduction in viable cell numbers and an increase in dead cells not only in the FBS- but also in the SLGC cultures of GBM4, GBM8 (Figure Also purified CD133+ GBM8 SLGCs (Figure The data thus far obtained suggested that the rate of proliferation influences the extent of late IR-induced apoptosis of SLGCs, particularly of those with nonfunctional p53 which undergo mitotic catastrophe after \u03b3-irradiation. Although all these differentiated lines underwent more \u03b3IR-induced apoptosis than the corresponding SLGC cultures, a large increase was only observed for the FBS culture of one line, GBM8. We observed that acute EGF/FGF addition to differentiated tumor cells reduces IR-induced \u03b3H2AX-signals while subacute and chronic withdrawal from non-differentiating stem-like cells increases them. This implies that, due to the different cytokine requirements, We have observed that acute EGF/FGF-2 addition to differentiated cultures of p53-deficient SLGCs even enhanced \u03b3IR-induced apoptosis rather than decreasing it, despite the usually assumed pro-survival effects of EGF and FGF-2 and even though the \u03b3H2AX signals were reduced by the addition of the two cytokines. However, proliferation was accelerated, indicating a stronger correlation of the observed delayed \u03b3IR-induced apoptosis to cellular proliferation than to DNA damage assessed by \u03b3H2AX. It is often argued that CSCs, like many types of normal tissue stem cells, may be relatively quiescent, but it has been shown that even some normal tissue stem cells proliferate very fast Recent publications showed that transient pretreatment with a proliferation-inducing agent leads to the effective chemotherapy-mediated elimination of dormant hematopoietic stem cells and human primary leukemia stem cells IR: ionizing radiation; EGF: epidermal growth factor; FGF: fibroblast growth factor; CSCs: cancer stem cells; SLGCs: stem-like glioma cells; ECM: extracellular matrix proteins; DSBs: DNA-double strand breaks; R: receptor; PI: propidium iodide.", "In presynaptic terminals, ER-alpha-IR was clustered and often associated with synaptic vesicles. Quantitative analysis revealed that nonsynaptic pools of ER-alpha-IR within the presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments were decreased (35 and 27%, respectively) in the young estrogen-replaced animals compared with those that received vehicle.", "Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were used to detect insulin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of both IR-beta and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, and insulin-stimulated binding of IRS-1 to p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) in the extracted muscle. In the in vitro study, purified IR from rat liver and/or recombinant IRS-1 protein with adenosine triphosphate were incubated with lignocaine (4 or 40 mM). Lignocaine reduced insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IR-beta to 12.6+/-5.7% (P<0.001), and IRS-1 to 32.1+/-18.8% (P<0.01), and also reduced insulin-stimulated binding of IRS-1 to p85 to 27.4+/-12.7% (P<0.001) relative to control (100%) in muscle in vivo. The in vitro study revealed that lignocaine directly inhibited both basal and insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IR. The inhibitory effect of lignocaine on tyrosine kinase activity of the IR underlies the suppression of insulin signalling with lignocaine.", "Together with structural and kinetic studies , these findings establish PTP1B as a physiological IR phosphatase. In muscle and liver (and possibly other tissues), PTP1B negatively regulates insulin signaling by directly dephosphorylating the IR . PTP1B also may regulate central IR signaling, and loss of this regulation could contribute to resistance to obesity in mice. Although the role of IR signaling in the brain remains unclear, the phenotypes of brain-specific and mice and data with insulinomimetic small molecule treatment are consistent with insulin action in the brain regulating body mass. Alternatively, PTP1B may regulate another pathway(s) besides the IR and LepR that controls body mass; candidates include other cytokine receptors that signal via Jak2.", "(2) The infarct size occupied 57.7+/-2.0% of the ischemic myocardium in IR group while IP reduced the infarct size to 27.7+/-1.5% (P<0.01). (3) DNA ladder pattern of ischemic myocardium was revealed by agrose gel electrophoresis in IR group while it was not found in IP group. Apoptotic cardiomyocytes were sparse within the ischemic myocardium at risk in IP as compared with those in IR heart. Apoptosis rate of the ischemic myocardium from IR and IP groups detected by flow cytometry was 11.2+/-0.4% and 6.35+/-0.2% (P<0.01), respectively. (4) Fas and Bax protein expression in the ischemic myocardium of IR and IP groups was elevated as compared with those in non-ischemic myocardium group (P<0.05). The Fas protein expression of IR group was higher than that of IP group (P<0.05). Bcl-2/Bax ratio of IR group was lower than that in non-ischemic myocardium (P<0.01). From the results, it is suggested that IP decreases cardiomyocytic apoptosis induced by IR and this action is mediated by the reduction of Fas protein expression.", "Blood samples of controls and individuals chronically exposed to IR were analysed. The second objective was to determine whether the Comet assay can be used to evaluate global repair phenotype as a susceptibility biomarker for IR-induced DNA damage in nuclear workers. The general conclusions from our study are: (i) a positive correlation exists between mechanistically related biomarkers; (ii) multivariate regression analysis confirmed that the interaction between smoking and exposure to IR negatively and statistically significantly influenced residual tail length; (iii) use of the Comet assay for the estimation of global repair phenotype with respect to IR is recommended because it is simple, fast and differences in in vitro repair capacity can be detected.", "20 adult rats were randomly divided into four groups: Control, IR, OT and IR+ OT (OTA). Immediately after induction of reperfusion 0.03 \u00b5g/kg OT were administered intraperitoneally to the IR+ OT. The results showed in addition tissue edema and congestion, a significant reduced in Johnson\u2019s score were detected in IR group in comparison with controls (p=0.01), and apoptotic index increased significantly (p=0.001). Administration of OT in OT+IR group, increased Johnson\u2019s score but it was not statistically significant. Germinal epithelium thickness was increased significantly (p=0.03), although apoptotic index decreased significantly in comparison with the IR group (p=0.04). In OT+IR group the same surgical procedure was performed as in IR group, OT (0.03 \u00b5g/kg; Sigma Chemical company) was injected intraperitoneally immediately after induction of reperfusion ( The quality of spermatogenesis in each seminiferous tubule was scored according to Johnson\u2019s scoring method ( Morphometric study of seminiferous tubules was done by using a graded microscopic lens. In OT+IR group edema and blood vessels congestion improved and Johnson score increased morphologically but no statically significant.

The histological damage of IR injury in testis has been shown in many studies with different time and degree of torsion and different time of reperfusion ( Kurcer and colleagues in a study that ischemia was performed for 1 hr and reperfusion injury was induced for 24 hr, showed that this time of ischemia and reperfusion can cause testicular tissue damage ( Spermatogenesis is a highly regulated process that is controlled mainly by the testosterone and gonadotropins ( Apoptosis or programed cell death that occurs in both physiologic and pathologic periods and naturally wave of apoptosis in testes of prepubertal mammals occurs, It appears that apoptosis is essential for the development of spermatogenesis in adolescence. Furthermore OT is involved in the contraction of the seminiferous and epididymis duct ( Alizadeh Furthermore It was shown that OT same as other G-protein coupled ligands can act in such a way that PI3K/AKT activation and release onto downstream kinases, such as glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, targeting the mitochondria to protect cells ( Based on light microscopy observation an obvious reduction in tissue edema and blood vessels congestion were seen and apoptotic cells were reduced in group OT+IR group in comparison with IR group and apoptotic index decreased significant statically (p<0.04), and this results confirmed that OT can decrease apoptotic index after acute ischemia reperfusion. In conclusion, we demonstrated the protective effect of OT on apoptosis immediately after reperfusion induction in testis for the first time and we can say that OT could improve spermatogenesis after IR injury and decrease apoptotic index without effect on LH, FSH and testosterone levels.", "Here, we have tested the hypothesis that the application of IR (10 MeV photon beams, 2-20 Gy) to lung and pancreatic carcinoma cells induces a migratory/invasive phenotype in these cells by hyperactivation of TGF-\u03b2 and/or activin signaling. In accordance with this assumption, IR induced gene expression patterns and migratory responses consistent with an EMT phenotype. Moreover, in A549 cells, IR triggered the synthesis and secretion of both TGF-\u03b21 and activin A as well as activation of intracellular TGF-\u03b2/activin signaling as evidenced by Smad phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of a TGF-\u03b2-responsive reporter gene. Likewise, specific antibody-mediated neutralization of soluble TGF-\u03b2, or dominant-negative inhibition of the TGF-\u03b2 receptors, but not the activin type I receptor, alleviated IR-induced cell migration. Moreover, the TGF-\u03b2-specific approaches also blocked IR-dependent TGF-\u03b21 secretion, Smad phosphorylation, and reporter gene activity, collectively indicating that autocrine production of TGF-\u03b2(s) and subsequent activation of TGF-\u03b2 rather than activin signaling drives these changes. IR strongly sensitized cells to further increase their migration in response to recombinant TGF-\u03b21 and this was accompanied by upregulation of TGF-\u03b2 receptor expression.", "(1) MS was defined by central obesity according to the IDF (modified guidelines of the WHO for the Asia Pacific region) [ (2) The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index was defined as follows: fasting insulin (in microinternational units [ The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with serious heart and liver dysfunction; (2) patients using insulin and oral hypoglycemic, antihypertensive, lipid-lowering drugs; (3) pregnant women; (4) patients with cancer or tuberculosis or other infectious diseases. We determined that, for both populations, IL-6, hsCRP, and FFA levels were higher in the MS group than in the non-MS group and that adiponectin is an adipose tissue factor that could improve IR.", "", "Despite its capacity to stimulate IR autophosphorylation, similar to insulin, we found that IR-A48 not only binds to an allosteric site distinct from the insulin binding site, but also preferentially induces Y1150 phosphorylation in the IR kinase domain. Moreover, Y1150-biased phosphorylation induced by IR-A48 selectively activates specific signaling pathways downstream of IR. In contrast to insulin-mediated activation of IR, IR-A48 binding has little effect on the MAPK pathway and proliferation of cancer cells. Instead, AKT S473 phosphorylation is highly stimulated by IR-A48, resulting in increased glucose uptake both Aptamers are single-strand oligonucleotides artificially isolated by an Most efforts to develop functional aptamers focused on their inhibitory effects on target molecules. The IR consists of two extracellular \u03b1-subunits that contain insulin binding sites and two transmembrane \u03b2-subunits with kinase activity. Insulin binding to the IR results in autophosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues, which increases IR kinase activity and initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling events ( Here, we present an agonistic IR aptamer, IR-A48, which binds to an allosteric site of the IR that is distinct from the insulin binding site. Interestingly, we found that IR-A48 not only preferentially stimulates Y1150 phosphorylation in the IR kinase domain, but also has biased activity toward the IRS-AKT S473 pathway, stimulating glucose uptake rather than activation of the MAPK pathway and subsequent cell proliferation. Our findings suggest that IR-A48 is a biased agonist able to specifically regulate the insulin signaling pathway (i.e. Anti-IR \u03b2-subunit (C-19), anti-IGF-1R \u03b2-subunit (C-20), anti-phospho-IR (10C3, Y1150/Y1151), anti-phospho-IRS1 (Y632) and anti-phospho-Shc (Y239/Y240) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

IRdye 800-conjugated anti-rabbit/mouse antibodies were purchased from Rockland (Limerick, PA, USA) and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit/mouse antibodies were purchased from KPL (Gaithersburg, MD, USA). To identify IR-specific aptamers, we performed a SELEX process as previously described ( The binding affinity of the aptamer to the extracellular domains of IR (His 28-Lys 944) and IGF-1R (Gln 31\u00adAsn 932) was analyzed by filter binding assay. After heating at 95\u00b0C for 3 min and then slow cooling to 37\u00b0C at 0.1\u00b0C/s in binding buffer [40 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl HEK293 and 3T3-L1 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA), and MCF-7 cells were purchased from KCLB (Korea Cell Line Bank, Seoul), and Rat-1 cells overexpressing human IR were kindly provided by Dr Nicholas J. G. Webster from the University of California, San Diego. HEK293, Rat-1/hIR and MCF-7 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Lonza) and 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were maintained in high glucose DMEM with 10% bovine serum (BS, Gibco) at 37\u00b0C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO Before insulin or aptamer stimulation, the cells were incubated in DMEM without FBS for 3 h and then incubated in Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer [25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO To prepare total cell lysate, harvested cells were lysed in lysis buffer [50 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 20 mM NaF, 10 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 2 mM Na Rat-1/hIR cells were grown in 100 mm dishes to 70% confluence. Based upon the concept that modulating the conformation of the extracellular domain of IR can be translated to the activation of intracellular functions, we used SELEX to develop IR aptamers capable of binding to the extracellular domain of human IR. SELEX was performed using single-strand DNA libraries that consist of a 40mer random region and both sides of 20mer constant regions and purified recombinant IR protein that consists of the extracellular domain (His 28-Lys 944) with a C-terminal His tag. Thymines in the random regions were replaced with 5-[N-(1-naphthylmethyl)carboxamide]-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (Nap-dU) to enhance the affinity and specificity of protein\u2013aptamer interactions ( To identify agonistic IR aptamers, we analyzed whether or not the aptamers (1 \u03bcmol/l) increased V-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) S473 phosphorylation in HEK293 cells over-expressing human IR. Although most aptamers had no effect on insulin signaling, one IR aptamer, IR-A48F, significantly stimulated AKT phosphorylation (data not shown). The sequence of IR-A48F consists of 80 nt and contains 8 Nap-dUs in the random region (Figure Properties and truncation of IR-A48. ( To investigate the binding properties of IR-A48, we performed an insulin competition assay, followed by flow cytometry. Rat-1 cells over-expressing human IR (Rat-1/hIR) were incubated with FITC-labeled insulin (50 nmol/l) and various concentrations of IR-A48 (0.04, 0.16, 0.63, 2.5 and 10 \u03bcmol/l) and FITC fluorescence was measured to assess changes in insulin binding. Despite its agonistic effect, IR-A48 did not interfere with the binding of insulin to IR, even at concentrations 200-fold higher than that of insulin (Figure Allosteric binding of IR-A48 and insulin receptor autophosphorylation. ( Consistent with the allosteric binding of IR-A48, insulin-induced downstream signaling (phosphorylation of Insulin receptor substrate (IRS), AKT and Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)) was not affected by IR-A48 treatment in Rat-1/hIR cells (Figure Insulin binding to IR results in autophosphorylation of seven tyrosine residues in the intracellular \u03b2-subunits (Y953 and Y960 in the juxtamembrane region; Y1146, Y1150 and Y1151 in the kinase domain; and Y1316 and Y1322 in the carboxy-terminus) ( Y1150-biased phosphorylation in the IR kinase domain by IR-A48. ( Because Y1150 and Y1151 are independently phosphorylated during IR autophosphorylation, we hypothesized that the two phospho-antibodies have different binding affinities for mono-pY1150, mono-pY1151 and dual-pY1150/pY1151 ( Even with the high structural similarity between IR and IGF-1R, IR-A48 did not bind to IGF-1R (Figure Next, we decided to confirm whether Y1150-biased phosphorylation by IR-A48 differently modulates downstream signaling compared to insulin. The phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on IR \u03b2-subunits plays two roles in the insulin signaling process. First, phosphorylations in the kinase domain (Y1146, Y1150 and Y1151) regulate IR kinase activity ( However, unexpectedly, IR-A48 significantly activated signaling in a manner comparable to insulin. In fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated by insulin (50 nmol/l), the phosphorylation of IR and major insulin signaling proteins such as IRS, AKT and ERK reached a maximal response in <5 min and gradually disappeared over several minutes to hours (Figure IR-A48 stimulated IR signaling produces distinct kinetic and phosphorylation patterns. ( Importantly, IR-A48 showed biased activity toward subsets of the insulin signaling pathway. The level of AKT phosphorylation induced by IR-A48 was biased toward S473. IR-A48-induced AKT S473 phosphorylation reached 98% of the level of phosphorylation induced by insulin, but AKT T308 phosphorylation stayed at just 37% of the level induced by insulin (Figure The MAPK pathway is one of the major signaling routes induced by IR autophosphorylation and is responsible for cell proliferation ( To analyze the mitogenic potency of IR-A48, we performed growth assays in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, which is widely used to study the proliferative effect of insulin. In MCF-7 cells, insulin increased cell proliferation by up to 2.1-fold, but IR-A48 had no effect on cell proliferation (Figure Proliferation of MCF-7 cells was not stimulated by IR-A48. ( The metabolic function of IR is mainly regulated by the IRS-AKT pathway ( To investigate the effect of IR-A48-induced signaling on glucose uptake, we measured 2-deoxy-glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes after time-dependent stimulation. Despite IR Y1150-biased phosphorylation, IR-A48 (200 nmol/l) increased glucose uptake to the same extent as insulin (50 nmol/l). In addition, consistent with its allosteric binding to IR (Figure IR-A48 stimulates glucose uptake through the PI3K pathway in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. ( In spite of the slower kinetics, IR-A48 fully induced glucose uptake at high concentrations. We measured glucose uptake induced by insulin and IR-A48 in a dose-dependent manner based on the time points that showed maximal response (30 min for insulin and 4 h for A48). At maximal concentrations, both IR-A48 and insulin showed similar saturated levels of glucose uptake (4.2- and 4-fold, respectively; Figure In insulin signaling cascades, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is fully responsible for AKT activation ( To investigate the PI3K-dependency of IR-A48 induced events, we measured glucose uptake and AKT phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes after pre-incubation with a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) for 1 h. Not only glucose uptake induced by IR-A48 (200 nmol/l) was significantly blocked by LY294002, regardless of stimulation time (30 min and 2 h), but AKT phosphorylation by IR-A48 was also inhibited (Figure To confirm our results IR-A48 lowers blood glucose levels in mice to the same degree as insulin. Insulin (0.6 unit/kg), IR-A48 (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg) and PBS were administered to 12 h fasted C57Bl/6J mice by tail vein injection and blood glucose levels were measured at 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after injection. ( In this study, we identified an agonistic IR aptamer, IR-A48, which is highly specific for IR without cross-activity for IGF-1R. IR-A48 binds to an allosteric site distinct from the orthosteric site for insulin binding and preferentially stimulates Y1150 phosphorylation in the IR kinase domain. Moreover, we demonstrated that the allosteric binding of IR-A48 not only stimulates activation of the IRS-AKT S473 pathway and glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, but also successfully lowers blood glucose levels in mice in a manner similar to insulin. However, unlike stimulation with insulin, activation of the MAPK pathway and the proliferation of MCF-7 cancer cells were not induced by IR-A48. Taken together, these results demonstrate that IR-A48 is a biased agonist of IR that selectively stimulates the metabolic activity of the receptor (glucose uptake) without mitogenic action (proliferation). This is the first study to show that aptamer\u2013protein interactions can not only differentially modulate receptor autophosphorylation (IR Y1150), but also induce specific signaling pathways and functional selectivity. However, their activity is based on receptor oligomerization mediated by aptamer bridges, rather than by a change in receptor conformation induced by aptamer\u2013receptor interactions ( A key aspect of biased agonists is their capacity to provide a therapeutic advantage for treating diseases by avoiding on-target adverse effects that arise from the activation of undesirable signaling pathways ( The biased nature of IR-A48-mediated IR modulation likely results from the altered structural state induced by the allosteric binding of IR-A48. Evidence for this comes from the pattern of IR autophosphorylation induced by IR-A48 binding compared to insulin. In our study, we demonstrated that IR-A48 preferentially stimulates Y1150 phosphorylation in the IR kinase domain. Interestingly, the current activation model for IR autophosphorylation cannot sufficiently explain how Y1150-biased phosphorylation occurs in the absence of Y1146 and 1151 phosphorylation. Currently, phosphorylation of Y1146, Y1150 and Y1151 in the IR kinase domain is believed to occur via The Y1150-biased phosphorylation induced by IR-A48 also differentially regulates signaling beyond simple receptor modulation. The data presented here reveal that IR-A48 can dramatically increase the phosphorylation of proteins in the IRS-AKT pathway such as IRS-1, AKT, AS160, FOXO1/3a and GSK3 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Conversely, phosphorylation of Src homology 2 domain containing transforming protein (SHC) and ERK in the MAPK pathway was not significantly stimulated by IR-A48. Previous studies on agonists that target the extracellular domain of IR reported similar biased signaling and functional selectivity. For instance, the synthetic peptide S597 and allosteric antibody XMetA induced higher activation of the IRS-AKT pathway than the MAPK pathway. Moreover, S597 induced the activation of glycogen synthesis in L6 myoblast cells and XMetA markedly improved glycemic control in diabetic model mice, but neither had an effect on cell proliferation ( We also observed that AKT phosphorylation by IR-A48 is biased toward S473 rather than T308. The finding that IR-A48 sufficiently stimulated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes suggests that AKT T308 phosphorylation is not critically involved in glucose uptake. The specific roles of T308 and S473 in AKT activation are still unclear, but AKT kinase is fully activated when both residues are phosphorylated ( Our understanding of the biased IR modulation by IR-A48 is incomplete, with a range of questions remaining to be answered.", "To determine whether FH is involved in IR-induced DSB repair in a cell cycle-dependent manner, we synchronized U2OS human osteosarcoma cells at G1 phase using a double-thymidine block or released the cells into S or G2 phase by removing thymidine for 2 or 6 h, respectively. Cell fractionation analyses showed that nuclear FH was much less in amount than cytosolic FH, and IR enhanced both nuclear and chromatin-associated FH ( To determine whether IR-induced FH pT236 phosphorylation is dependent on mitochondrial localization of FH, we depleted endogenous FH and reconstituted the expression of RNAi-resistant (r) FH (N), in which the 21 N-terminal amino acids containing the mitochondrial localization sequence were deleted To determine the role of FH T236 phosphorylation in DNA repair, we used a PCR strategy and a DR-GFP system to analyze NHEJ repair and HR, respectively ( H2A.Z mediates the association between FH and chromatin upon DNA damage ( The M6 cassette that encompasses amino acids 89\u2013100 of H2A.Z specifically interacts with other proteins To determine whether FH activity is involved in NHEJ repair, we examined the chromatin-associated FH activity in converting malate to fumarate. As shown in We found that IR-induced and FH phosphorylation-regulated H3K36Me2 occurred in both U2OS and GSC11 cells. Clonogenic assay showed that IR enhanced the death rate of U2OS cells expressing rFH T236A ( Metabolic enzymes execute their metabolic functions in cytosol and mitochondria. However, in response to extracellular stimuli, these enzymes, which include PKM2, FH, and MATII\u03b1 (a methionine adenosyltransferase isozyme), possess functions that are not directly linked to metabolism regulation when they alter their subcellular localization HR, which requires complete histone eviction adjacent to the DSBs, regulates DNA repair during S-G2 phase FH T236 is rapidly phosphorylated by DNA-PK at the early phase of NHEJ in response to IR. Kinase reactions were performed as described previously The genomic DNA of cells with or without I- U2OS cells containing a single copy of the HR repair reporter substrate DR-GFP were used Cells (1\u00d710 WT and mutant His-FH and GST-H2A.Z were expressed in bacteria and purified, as described previously To measure FH activity, we collected chromatin extract from cells 1 h after IR (10 Gy). a, b, d, f, h, U2OS cells were harvested 1 h after IR (10 Gy). c, d, Cell viability was examined 12 h after IR by using clonogenic assay. IR induces DNA-PK-mediated phosphorylation of FH T236, leading to the binding of FH to H2A.Z adjacent to DSBs.", "", "Inhibiting the protein expression of MCP Intraperitoneal injection of dexmedetomidine significantly protected intestine IR injury in rats by inhibiting the inflammatory response, intestinal epithelial apoptosis, and maintaining structural integrity of intestinal cells. Animals were randomly assigned into 3 groups including group A (sham-operated or control, n=8); group B (intestinal IR, n=8); and group C (pretreated intestinal IR, n=8, and 50 \u03bcg of dexmedetomidine was intraperitoneally injected 30 min before intestinal IR); the dosage was determined from previous study ( The animals were anesthetized using the combination of sodium pentobarbital (390 mg) and sodium phenytoin (50 mg/ml), and a midline abdominal incision was made.", "RNF126-\u0394f overexpression failed to induce a significant increase in luciferase activity driven by the BRCA1 promoter in the cells co-expressing E2F1 whereas overexpression of RNF126-WT leads to an increased luciferase activity in the same condition ( Defect in HR leads to the enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs as well as IR. The finding that RNF126 promotes HR via regulating BRCA1 expression ( We identified a new function of RNF126 in transcriptional regulation of BRCA1 gene by acting as a regulator of E2F1 ( Consistent with its role in HR, RNF126 contributes to the resistance to IR and PARP inhibitor ( In addition to BRCA1, other E2F1 target genes such as apoptosis genes are also regulated by RNF126 ( In addition to pRb family members which have long been considered to be the major regulators of E2F1, TOPBP1 and MCPH1 are recently found to be a new class of regulators for E2F1.", "Consumption of a diet high in saturated fats and sucrose is an important factor in the increasing occurrence of these metabolic disorders, primarily NAFLD and IR.", "We found overexpression of miR-106b could induce resistance to IR in vitro and in vivo in SW620 cells. In addition, overexpression of miR-106b could enhance the tumour-initiating cell capacity without or with IR condition, such as the colony sphere formation capacity and the upregulation of stemness-related genes (CD133, Sox2). The cells were treated with a range of IR doses [0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 Gy, Nasatron (Cs-137) irradiator]. We used GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, LaJolla, CA, USA) to fit the cell survival curve in accordance with a standard linear-quadratic (LQ) model and obtain the values of the survival fraction of a range of IR doses. Finally, xenograft tumours of nude mice were utilized to study the sensitivity to IR. MiR-106b enhances tumour-initiating cell capacity without or with IR. In conclusion, cells that express high levels of miR-106b more strongly initiated tumours under both normal and IR conditions. This finding may explain why cells that express higher high levels of endogenous miR-106b exhibit greater proliferation potential and resistance to IR. We sought to determine whether the restoration of PTEN in miR-106b-overexpressing SW620 cells could reduce the cell resistance to IR. The data showed that blocking the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway could enhance the cell sensitivity to IR (*p<0.05; Additional file Based on these data, we concluded that the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway plays a dominant role in miR-106b mediated-radioresistance in CRC.", "Furthermore, downregulation of NFBD1 inhibited the amplification of the IR-induced DNA damage signal, and failed to accumulate and retain DNA damage-response proteins at the DNA damage sites, which leaded to defective checkpoint activation following DNA damage. We also implicated the involvement of NFBD1 in IR-induced Rad51 and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit foci formation. Xenografts models in nude mice showed that silencing NFBD1 significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of IR, leading to tumor growth inhibition of the combination therapy. The transfected cells of stable expression NFBD1 shRNA and control shRNA were obtain under puromycin (1 We next examined the ability of NFBD1 silenced cells to respond to IR-induced DNA damage, cells were plated at low density, exposed to IR and assessed for their ability to form colonies. NFBD1-shRNA group exhibited hypersensitivity to the killing effects of IR ( DNA DSBs are the most dangerous damage caused by IR, posing a serious threat to cell viability and genome stability. Considering the notion that apoptosis can increase DNA damage and histone H3 phosphorylation, so we determined if IR induces the apoptosis in the early phase, the results showed that the apoptotic percentage was not significantly unchanged post IR treatment ( To assess whether NFBD1 could localize to sites of damage, cells were treated with IR and stained with anti-NFBD1 antibody. NFBD1 rapidly formed foci within 1 h after exposure to IR ( The Rad51 and phosphorylated DNA-PKcs proteins are frequently detected in multiple discrete subnuclear structures, referred to as nuclear foci, which are thought to participate in the DNA repair process and may represent sites of ongoing recombination. To define the relationship between NFBD1 and Rad51, phosphorylated DNA-PKcs, we studied the formation of Rad51 IR-induced foci (IRIF) after 8 Gy IR. The results of immunofluorescence staining displayed that downregulation NFBD1 significantly affected the formation of Rad51 and DNA-PKcs foci after 8 Gy IR ( As previously reported, upon IR agents, the Rad51 and DNA-PKcs proteins were recruited to the end of resulting DNA damage and formed subnuclear complexes that were microscopically detectable as foci, which contained many of the enzymatic activities required for efficient repair of DSBs. To further identify the relationship of NFBD1 with the two critical proteins, we studied the formation of Rad51 and DNA-PKcs IRIF at various time points after exposure to 8 Gy of IR ( To determine the effect of combining downregulation NFBD1 with radiation Radiation therapy is used to treat all stages of localized NPC. The sensitivity to IR suggests an important role in responding to DNA damage. In the case of IR-induced DSBs, As far as we know, the phosphorylation of NHEJ components, including DNA-PKcs itself, is important for the intrinsic kinase activity of DNA-PK, which accounts for NHEJ-mediated DSB repair and the cellular resistance to radiation, however, Rad51 protein, has an essential role exclusively in HR in mammalian cells. NFBD1 knockdown also inhibit the amplification of the IR-induced DNA damage signal, and fail to accumulation and retain DDR proteins at the sites of DNA damage, which leads to defective checkpoint activation following DNA damage. Furthermore, silencing of NFBD1 impairs the formation of Rad51 and DNA-PKcs IRIF. Using xenografts models in nude mice showed that silencing NFBD1 significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of IR, leading to tumor growth inhibition of the combination therapy. Cells were seeded at low density and irradiated with various doses of IR. Cells were treated with 4 Gy or sham treated and collected at 0 h (no-IR), 30 min and 6-post IR.", "", "The objective of the study was to examine the relationship between CAV1 variants and IR in two hypertensive cohorts and to corroborate the findings in a CAV1 knockout mouse. In the Caucasian hypertensive cohort, minor allele carriers of two CAV1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs926198, rs3807989) had significantly higher fasting insulin levels (P = 0.005, P = 0.007), increased homeostatic assessment model for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (P =0.005, P = 0.008), and decreased M value during hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp procedure (P = 0.004, P = 0.05) than major allele homozygotes. Findings were replicated in the Hispanic hypertensive cohort cohort for fasting insulin levels (P = 0.005, P = 0.02) and HOMA-IR (P = 0.008 and P = 0.02). Meta-analysis demonstrated significant associations of both single-nucleotide polymorphisms with fasting insulin levels (P = 0.00008, P = 0.0004) and HOMA-IR (P = 0.0001, P = 0.0004). As compared with wild type, CAV1 knockout mice displayed higher blood pressure levels and higher fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR levels and an exaggerated glycemic response to a glucose challenge. Variations in the CAV1 gene are associated with IR and hypertension. CAV1 gene polymorphisms may be a biomarker for IR and hypertension, enabling earlier detection and improved treatment strategies.", "The susceptibility of the intestine to IR-induced injury (IRI) appears from various experimental studies and clinical settings such as cardiac and major vascular surgery and organ transplantation. Whereas oxygen free radicals, activation of leukocytes, failure of microvascular perfusion, cellular acidosis and disturbance of intracellular homeostasis have been implicated as important factors in the pathogenesis of intestinal IRI, the mechanisms underlying this disorder are not well known. To date, increasing attention is being paid in animal studies to potential pre- and post-ischemia treatments that protect against intestinal IRI such as drug interference with IR-induced apoptosis and inflammation processes and ischemic pre-conditioning.", "We show that DSBs generated following acute exposure of G0/G1 cells to the oxidative damaging agent, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBH), are repaired with fast and slow components of similar magnitude to IR-induced DSBs and have a similar requirement for ATM and Artemis. ROS predominantly introduces DNA base or sugar damage leading to single-strand break (SSB) formation ( DNA non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is the major DSB repair pathway in mammalian cells ( ROS-induced DNA damage is similar to, but distinct from, IR-induced damage. Although a substantial contribution to IR-induced damage represents oxidative damage from secondary electrons, multiple lesions can arise in close proximity generating complex DSBs. Previously, we reported that pKAP-1 occurs in a pan nuclear manner at early times post IR exposure and as discrete foci at later times ( ATM and Artemis are required for the repair of a subset of IR-induced DSBs, representing those that arise in HC ( To avoid the impact of replication damage and checkpoint arrest, we have primarily focused on DSB repair in non-replicating cells. We find that DSBs generated by TBH treatment or IR are repaired with similar kinetics, have a similar magnitude of a slow component and a similar requirement for ATM and Artemis for repair. This is further supported by our finding that KAP-1 siRNA bypasses the need for ATM in the repair of ROS-induced DSBs as for IR-induced DSBs and that the persisting DSBs harbour pKAP-1 foci, a feature which only arises at KAP-1 rich HC DSBs. This strongly suggests that ROS-induced DSBs arise in HC with a ratio of HC:EU DSBs being similar (1:5) to that induced by IR. The examination of Artemis function is clinically significant since, although Artemis defective patients display severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), they currently survive to adulthood following bone marrow transplantation ( In summary, we show that DSBs induced by oxidative damage are repaired with similar kinetics to IR-induced DSBs, have a similar slow component and a similar requirement for ATM and Artemis. These findings are important for considering patient care but add further mechanistic insight into how ROS and IR-induced DSBs are repaired.", "Autophosphorylation of the partially purified IRF1146 was reduced 60-70% when compared to the wild-type IR but was still stimulated by insulin. The phosphotransferase activity of the dephospho form of both the IR and IRF1146 toward exogenous substrates was stimulated 3- to 4-fold by insulin. However, the wild-type IR was activated 12-fold by autophosphorylation, whereas the IRF1146 was activated only 2-fold. When the IRF1146 was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, insulin binding was normal, whereas autophosphorylation was reduced 80% when compared to cells expressing the wild-type IR. Endogenous substrates of the insulin receptor kinase were not detected during insulin stimulation of CHO cells expressing the IRF1146. Moreover, the IRF1146 did not internalize insulin rapidly or stimulate DNA synthesis in the presence of insulin. In contrast, both the IR and IRF1146 stimulated glycogen synthase equally in CHO cells. These data suggest that activation of the IR tyrosine kinase can be resolved into two components: the first is dependent on insulin binding and the second is dependent on the subsequent insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation cascade. Thus, at least two signal transduction pathways diverging from the IR are implicated in the mechanism of insulin action.", "The time course of insulin-induced activation of PKC delta closely paralleled that of IR. Insulin stimulation caused a selective coprecipitation of PKC delta with IR, and these IR immunoprecipitates from insulin-stimulated cells displayed a striking induction of PKC activity due specifically to PKC delta. To examine the involvement of PKC delta in the IR signaling cascade, we used recombinant adenovirus constructs of wild-type (W.T.) Overexpression of W.T.PKC delta induced PKC delta activity and coassociation of PKC delta and IR without addition of insulin. Overexpression of D.N.PKC delta abrogated insulin- induced coassociation of PKC delta and IR. Insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IR was greatly attenuated in cells overexpressing W.T.PKC delta, whereas in myotubes overexpressing D.N.PKC delta, tyrosine phosphorylation occurred without addition of insulin and was sustained longer than that in control myotubes. In control myotubes IR displayed a low level of serine phosphorylation, which was increased by insulin stimulation. Overexpression of W.T.PKC delta caused IR to localize mainly in the internal membrane fractions, and blockade of PKC delta abrogated insulin-induced IR internalization. We conclude that PKC delta is involved in regulation of IR activity and routing, and this regulation may be important in subsequent steps in the IR signaling cascade.", "In this study, we report the identification of two BALB/c strain-specific polymorphisms in the coding region of Prkdc, the gene encoding the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, which is known to be involved in DNA double-stranded break repair and post-IR signal transduction. This unique PrkdcBALB variant gene is shown to be associated with decreased DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit activity and with increased susceptibility to IR-induced genomic instability in primary mammary epithelial cells. The data provide the first evidence that naturally arising allelic variation in a mouse DNA damage response gene may associate with IR response and breast cancer risk.", "Interestingly, hyperphosphorylation of hRad9 induced by IR is dependent on ATM. Furthermore, hRad9 is phosphorylated on Ser(272) in response to IR in vivo, and this modification is delayed in ATM-deficient cells. Expression of hRad9 S272A mutant protein in human lung fibroblast VA13 cells disturbs IR-induced G(1)/S checkpoint activation and increased cellular sensitivity to IR. Together, our results suggest that the ATM-mediated phosphorylation of hRad9 is required for IR-induced checkpoint activation.", "HOMA-IR values, serum FT4 (free thyroxine) levels, and age were higher in the thyroid nodule group than in the control group. Logistic regression analysis showed that age, sex, FT4, and HOMA-IR were positive factors for thyroid nodule. The volume and size of the thyroid nodule were positively correlated with HOMA-IR, irrespective of gender. IR might be a risk factor for thyroid nodule. Whether alleviating the IR might slow the growth, or diminish the volume and size of the thyroid nodules, is yet to be elucidated. IR is a risk factor for several diseases such as coronary artery disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, essential hypertension, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and other disorders [ A prospective cross-sectional study was performed from March 2014 to 2016. The independent samples The clinical characteristics of the subjects were described in The binary logistic regression analysis showed that age, sex, FT4, and HOMA-IR remained as the risk factors for thyroid nodule in the T2DM patients ( Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the thyroid nodule volume and size were significantly positively correlated with HOMA-IR ( In the present study, the 201 patients with thyroid nodules encompassed 99 (49.3%) females and 102 (50.7%) males. The thyroid nodule volume and size were higher in females than in males in this group (0.40 \u00b1 0.67 versus 0.18 \u00b1 0.31, Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the thyroid nodule volume was significantly positively correlated with HOMA-IR in female and male patients ( Diabetes mellitus and thyroid nodule are the most common diseases in endocrinopathies of adult population. IR is one of the key factors in the pathogenesis of T2DM [ The glucose clamp technique is considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d to assess insulin sensitivity in humans, but is not adequate for studies involving hundreds or thousands of subjects in clinical investigations [ Anil et al. A previous study showed that the thyroid nodules were common in women and usually increased with age and decreasing iodine intake [ We found another positive indicator associated with nodule formation, HOMA-IR, which contributed to the volume and size of thyroid nodules. IR is a characteristic feature of most patients with simple obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and impaired glucose tolerance, as well as hypertension, especially to T2DM [ Some humoral or hormonal mediators, such as leptin, found to be increased in patients with T2DM [ The thyroid nodule volume and size, as well as HOMA-IR, were higher in females than males in T2DM patients with thyroid nodules. The elevated rate of incidence of thyroid nodule in females might be associated with the periodical changes in female endocrines [ In a previous report by Anil et al., metformin therapy significantly decreased nodule size in subjects with IR [ Our study demonstrated that the insulin resistance was a risk factor for thyroid nodule in patients with T2DM. We concluded that the thyroid nodule volume and thyroid nodule size were increased with HOMA-IR in T2DM patients. The thyroid nodule volume and thyroid nodule size were larger in females than in males with T2DM, and they also increased with the level of IR. Alleviating the IR may decline their growth rate and minimize the volume and size. (a) The correlation between the thyroid nodule volume and HOMA-IR.

In this study, we found that MSC-CM could protect irradiated HUVEC against IR-induced apoptosis. Herein, 30 irradiated mice were intraperitoneally injected with MSC-CM, namely, the IR+MSC-CM group; whereas, 30 mice received DMEM, namely, the IR+DMEM group. Herein, a total of 20 mice (10 from the IR+DMEM group and 10 from the IR+MSC-CM group) were used for survival analysis and body weight evaluation. For the remaining mice, 30 (10 from the Normal group, 10 from the IR+DMEM group and 10 from the IR+MSC-CM group) were sacrificed to harvest peripheral blood at 5 days post-IR. Twenty-four mice (8 from the Normal group, 8 from the IR+DMEM group and 8 from the IR+MSC-CM group) were sacrificed to harvest peripheral blood and small intestine. Unpaired Our present work revealed the specific roles of MSC-CM for protecting against IR-stress, mainly presenting effective maintenance of HUVEC survival We would like to extend our sincere gratitude to Mrs. Xiuzhu Gao, from public experiment platform of First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University and Dr. Dong Li, from college of basic medicine of Jilin University for their technical supports.", "Research on IR-induced clonogenic cell death is important for understanding the toxicity of IR to normal tissues, as well as for developing methods to increase the treatment efficacy of cancer radiotherapy. Apoptosis, mitotic catastrophe, and cellular senescence are the major modes of clonogenic cell death induced by IR Various cell-based assays have been developed to individually assess apoptosis, mitotic catastrophe, and cellular senescence. Apoptosis can be assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining, annexin V staining, DNA fragmentation assays, and sub-G1 cell-cycle phase determination by flow cytometry In this article, we describe a quick and cost-effective one-step assay for simultaneously assessing apoptosis, mitotic catastrophe, and cellular senescence induced by IR Place cover slips in a glass beaker. The iso-clonogenic survival dose can be determined by the clonogenic survival assay In step 3.3, the time from irradiation to fixation can be modified according to the researchers' interest; this is important because the peak time for IR-induced apoptosis, mitotic catastrophe, and cellular senescence varies according to cell line and treatment. In the field of radiation biology, mitotic catastrophe is considered a major mode of IR-induced cell death that is distinct from other mechanisms of clonogenic cell death In summary, the DAPI staining assay is a cost-effective one-step assay to simultaneously assess the three major modes of IR-induced clonogenic cell death.", "We have previously demonstrated that IRR activation is defined by its extracellular region, involves multiple domains, and shows positive cooperativity with two synergistic sites. By the analyses of point mutants and chimeras of IRR with IR in, we now address the role of the fibronectin type III (FnIII) repeats in the IRR pH-sensing. The first activation site includes the intrinsically disordered subdomain ID (646\u2013716) within the FnIII-2 domain at the C-terminus of IRR alpha subunit together with closely located residues L135, G188, R244, H318, and K319 of L1 and C domains of the second subunit. The second site involves residue T582 of FnIII-1 domain at the top of IRR lambda-shape pyramid together with M406, V407, and D408 from L2 domain within the second subunit. A possible importance of the IRR carbohydrate moiety for its activation was also assessed. IRR is normally less glycosylated than IR and IGF-IR. Swapping both FnIII-2 and FnIII-3 IRR domains with those of IR shifted beta-subunit mass from 68 kDa for IRR to about 100 kDa due to increased glycosylation and abolished the IRR pH response. However, mutations of four asparagine residues, potential glycosylation sites in chimera IRR with swapped FnIII-2/3 domains of IR, decreased the chimera glycosylation and resulted in a partial restoration of IRR pH-sensing activity, suggesting that the extensive glycosylation of FnIII-2/3 provides steric hindrance for the alkali-induced rearrangement of the IRR ectodomain. [ As of now, no peptide or protein has been yet found to activate IRR. Unexpectedly, an unusual property of IRR to work as a sensor of extracellular medium pH was discovered [ The pH-sensing property of IRR is preserved in frog, mouse, and human [ By the analysis of IRR/IR chimeras and IRR point mutants, it was shown that the alkali-induced activation of IRR is defined by its extracellular region and involves multiple domains with the key role of L1C domains and FnIII repeats [ To analyze the role of fibronectin type-III repeats regions (FnIII-1, FnIII-2, and FnIII-3) in detail, we have constructed plasmids with alanine mutagenesis of potentially important amino acid residues, which were identified by the multiple alignment of the fibronectin domains of IR, IGF-IR, and IRR sequences from different species ( The pH-sensing activity of the mutants was analyzed utilizing the previously developed in vitro autophosphorylation assay that allows quantitative assessment of tyrosine kinase activation [ The activity of T582 mutant decreased to 64 \u00b1 2% as compared to the wild-type IRR ( According to the published crystal structure of the IR ectodomain that represents a \u039b-shape head-to-tail symmetrical dimer, L1 and C domains of one monomer come in contact with FnIII-2 and FnIII-3 domains of the other, while its L2 domain is close to the FnIII-1 domain of the opposing subunit [ We further tested the effect of T582 and AED mutations on the pH dependence of IRR activation in the intact cell assay ( For the AED-IRR construct, we failed to find any significant response to alkali treatment ( We reported previously that the replacement of both FnIII-2 and FnIII-3 domains of IRR with those of IR (Fn2&3-IRR construct) completely abolished its pH sensing and also shifted the size of its beta-subunit from about 70 to about 100 kDa [ The significant difference in the extent of IR and IRR glycosylation suggested that the carbohydrate moiety of IRR may play a role in its alkali-dependent activation. To test this possibility, we removed three potential sites for N-glycosylation in Fn2&3-IRR chimera. Three different constructs with double mutations of two different asparagines in FnIII-2 and FnIII-3 domains to alanines were named N2r-IRR, N2m-IRR and N2l-IRR ( Alkali-sensing receptor tyrosine kinase IRR is a close relative of the insulin receptor. In an attempt to identify the key structural differences between these receptors that define the IRR alkali-sensing properties, we analyzed the impact of single point mutations, as well IRR/IR domain swapping on their activity. The interpretation of our results is based on the assumption that the IRR structure resembles the published three-dimensional structure of the IR ectodomain [ Our previous data suggested that multiple domains of the IRR extracellular N-terminal region contribute to the receptor alkali-sensing property, the L1C and three FnIII domains being the most important. The activation of IRR has a positive cooperativity with Hill\u2019s coefficient of about 2.3 [ Mutation of the T582 residue of the FnIII-1 domain significantly reduced the IRR activity and was also accompanied by a loss of positive cooperativity. This residue is located closely to the top of the dimer \u201carch\u201d and can physically face the L2 domain of the second subunit ( When the \u201cunstructured\u201d region within FnIII-2 domain of IRR (residues 646\u2013716) was swapped with the corresponding fragment of IR (663\u2013734), a large negative effect on alkali sensing was observed. Homological region in IR ectodomain structure is partially unstructured, which indicated great mobility of this part ( Our data suggest that not only the polypeptide backbone of IRR, but also its carbohydrate coat is important for pH sensing. It is known that IRR is significantly less glycosylated than IR or IGF-IR, mostly in FnIII-2 and FnIII-3 domains [ Altogether, our previous and current data suggest complex multipoint interactions inside IRR ectodomain under alkali-induced conformational changes within the IRR ectodomain. Although we identified certain parts and residues needed for pH-sensing, the precise molecular mechanism of IRR activation would require future detailed studies of the receptor structure by modern physical methods. The chimeras of human IRR and IR with partial ectodomain or tyrosine kinase domain swapping were obtained by cloning using the PCR strategy, as described in [ HEK 293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mM To analyze the pH dependence of the mutants activation, transfected cells were incubated with a set of Tris-buffered physiological saline solutions with pH varied in the range from 7.4 to 9.4 in small increments. The transfected cells were lyzed with the sample buffer, separated by electrophoresis, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-pIR/IRR antibodies [ The ratio of integral density of the phosphorylated receptor (pIR/IRR signal) to the total receptor (IR/IRR antibody signal) was plotted versus pH. EC HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding IRR or mutant chimeras with C-terminal 6xHis-tag, essentially as described [ Rabbit anti-IR/IRR antibodies were raised against the human IRR C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (aminoacid residues 961-1297) expressed in bacteria as GST-fusion protein. The anti-pIR/IRR antibodies were raised against KLH-coupled peptide CGMTRDVpYETDpYpYRKGGKGL from the activation loop of IRR, as described in [ HEK 293 cells were transfected with the AED chimera and IRR construct. After starvation, the cells were biotinylated with Biotin 3-sulfo- HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Fn2&3-IRR chimera. ( The pH dependence of IRR chimeric mutants. ( Treatment of Fn2&3-IRR with PNGase. Proteins from HEK 293 transfected cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-IR/IRR antibodies.", "While stimulation of IGF-1R by IGFs triggers autophosphorylation and subsequent phosphorylation of either insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) or insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2), it is clear that these adapter proteins are activated by both IR Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated the expression of IGF-1R adapter proteins, specifically IRS-1, is correlated with poor prognosis in ER positive breast cancer patients. Estradiol (E2) and its receptor ER enhance the expression and activation of the IGF-1R There is a growing body of evidence describing the physiological and therapeutic relevance of the functional similarities between IR and IGF-1R in many diseases including diabetes and cancer. The receptors were first identified as holoreceptors containing \u03b1\u03b2 chains transcribed from a single gene, but it is also evident hybrid receptors can form from the two separate gene products ( While the higher binding affinity of insulin to IR-A was first characterized as a pathway for glucose regulation during fetal and embryological life, IR-A also is expressed in many types of cancer. Advanced studies in cell biology and biochemistry have characterized IGF-1R with IR and their isoforms and hybrids receptors operate as a complex network in the cytoplasmic membrane ( We have previously demonstrated exposure of MCF-7 breast cancer to an IGF-1R-ATP antagonist inhibitor. In several clinical trials combining anti-IGF-1R and endocrine treatment It has been shown that IGF-1R activation in breast cancer results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1/2 and Src-homology-2-domains. Since IRS-1 is required for IGF-1R stimulation of cell proliferation and IRS-2 is involved in cancer motility and metastasis, In this review, we have described the role of IGF-1R and IR and their ligands, insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2, to regulate cell growth, survival, and glucose uptake Since the IGFBPs\u2019 family ensures the bioavailability of IGF-1/2 and insulin in serum, IGFBPs serve as another regulator of the IGF-1R network. As IRS-1 and IRS-2 are thought to mediate most of the effects of IR and IGF-1R in breast cancer cells, it may be possible to disrupt this molecule without affecting normal glucose homeostasis mediated by other adapter proteins in insulin target organs. Ongoing investigation in our laboratory has motivated us to hypothesize that the molecular composition of plasma membrane microdomains associated with IGF-1R network receptors might dictate the tumorigenic activity of IRS-1/2 in breast cancer. Schematic representation of the type I IGF-1R and IR signaling network. The receptors are transcribed from a single gene, IGF-1R, and IR. In addition, InsR has two isoforms generated by splice variants of the IR gene, IR-A and IR-B. These subunits may form a holoreceptor (IGF-1R, IR-A, IR-B) or the units can form heterodimeric hybrid receptors (IGF-1R/IR-A, IGF-1R/IR-B, IR-A/IR-B). Both IGF-1 and IGF-2 exert their effects through autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine mechanisms, and can activate the IGF-1R and IR pathways. The binding of each receptor by their ligands induce the phosphorylation of Shc and IRS-1/2.", "Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that the low-dose IR induced residual \u03b3H2A\u0425 foci do not play a role in delayed irradiation consequences, associated with cellular senescence in cultured MSCs. It is commonly assumed that it is DSBs that trigger the cellular response to IR exposure [ The major mechanisms underlying the DSB induction and repair are well characterized for high-dose irradiation [ Of particular interest are the studies of the low-dose radiation effects produced in stem cells. \u0410\u0422\u041c protein (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) is the major kinase that phosphorylates histone \u041d2AX in response to the IR-induced DNA DSB formation [ ( We first observed that the co-localized foci (\u03b3H2AX+/pATM+) resulting from 80 mGy irradiation returned to basal levels by 24 h post-irradiation (Fig. This was in spite of the fact that 80 mGy-exposed cells demonstrated elevated levels of foci at 24 h after IR treatment.", "Humans exposed to GC excess display IR, impaired glucose tolerance, and eventually develop diabetes. Rodent models demonstrate that GC-induced IR is accompanied by compensatory beta-cell hyperplasia.", "This suggests notable IR injury in the more ischemically damaged DGF allografts. There is evidence that anoxia, ischemia and infarction can lead to rapid loss of high-energy phosphates and accumulation of hydrolysis products, such as citrate, lactate and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate; thus, allografts with higher levels of citrate may have suffered greater IR injury and thus be more susceptible to the occurrence of DGF after transplantation [ Even more importantly, IR injury could significantly impact osmoregulation, as reflected by the altered levels of osmolytes, like taurine and betaine, that have been demonstrated in both the present study and in previous ones [ In 2014, Guy et al. These metabolomic perturbations may prove useful in explaining the mechanisms of kidney IR injury and DGF.", "Various techniques, such as compressed sensing The goal of the current work is to use ML accelerated AIMD calculations to simulate accurate IR spectra of different organic molecules. Second, the ability of HDNNPs to efficiently deal with macromolecular systems was demonstrated by (a) constructing a HDNNP of a simple alkane chain based only on small fragments of the macromolecule and then (b) using the resulting model to predict the IR spectra of alkanes of varying chain lengths. In the case of alkanes, we demonstrate that in principle highly accurate double-hybrid density functionals In AIMD, vibrational spectra are computed Upon closer examination of eqn (1), several challenges to model AIMD quality IR spectra In a HDNNP (shown in The chemical environment of an atom is represented by a set of many-body symmetry functions { In order for HDNNPs to yield reliable models of the PES, a set of optimal parameters needs to be determined for the elemental NNs. A vital ingredient in the simulation of IR spectra with AIMD is the molecular dipole moment (see eqn (1)). IR spectra were obtained with molecular dynamics simulations in the gas phase employing the same timestep as the sampling procedure. Due to its small size, the methanol molecule constitutes an excellent test system, not only for the direct comparison between the IR spectra obtained The final ML model for methanol consists of two HDNNPs and a NN dipole moment model trained on the BP86 data for 245 configurations. In the case of energies ( In order to study the quality of an IR spectrum modeled with the composite ML model, it is compared directly to the spectrum obtained Finally, both simulations agree well with the experimental spectrum, serving as an example of the utility of AIMD and ML accelerated AIMD for the prediction of accurate vibrational spectra. HDNNPs, as well as the dipole moment model presented in this work, can overcome this limitation The two HDNNPs and NN dipole moment model constituting the final ML model were trained on reference calculations for 534 fragments of the The IR spectrum of the C Although the general shape and features of the IR spectrum are described well by the ML model, some peak positions deviate from the expected experimental frequencies. In order to investigate the ability of ML accelerated AIMD to account for these effects, the composite ML model is used to simulate the IR spectrum of the protonated alanine tripeptide molecule (Ala The composite Ala Previous theoretical studies by Vaden and coworkers As can be seen, the ML model correctly captures the features present in the experimental spectrum.", "IR-A is found in the adult nervous system and has a higher affinity for insulin than IR-B, which is found mainly is adipose tissue, hepatic tissue, and skeletal muscle (Zhao W.-Q. et al., An acute elevation of peripheral insulin (generally in response to an increase in exogenous or endogenous glucose) promotes insulin transport across the BBB into the CNS, thus facilitating its role for a variety of important brain functions (Woods et al., Intriguingly, the process of learning may modify IR expression and function throughout specific brain regions (Zhao et al., One such mechanism by which insulin may influence cognition is by affecting cerebral energy metabolism. For example, the soluble form of A\u03b2 is able to bind to the IR, and has been shown to disrupt insulin signaling and activation of three kinases in primary hippocampal neurons (Townsend et al., Another common feature of AD and insulin resistance is mitochondrial dysfunction, which is supported by several key findings (Lowell and Shulman, Second, mitochondrial function in adults with AD may be affected by the accumulation of A\u03b2, which seems to be at least partly mediated by A\u03b2-binding-alcohol-dehydrogenase (ABAD; Yao et al., Additionally, A\u03b2 has been shown to impair mitochondrial calcium homeostasis, which may lead to disruption of mitochondrial permeability transition pore and eventually cell death (Bezprozvanny and Mattson, Epidemiological evidence has described parental history of AD as being an important predisposition to developing the disease (Fratiglioni et al., Even prior to the first articles concerning an Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis of AD (Hardy and Higgins, Given the systemic metabolic dysfunction seen in AD potentially promoted by insulin resistance, it is important to understand the various metabolic fuels that may be used by the brain and how our current knowledge of brain metabolism is limited by the study of mainly one of these fuels.", "Here, we demonstrated that cardiac DUSP1 was downregulated following acute cardiac IR injury. In vivo, compared to wild-type mice, DUSP1 transgenic mice (DUSP1 IR injury induces DUSP1 downregulation. The whole heart was immediately fixed at 4 \u00b0C with 2% glutaraldehyde in a 0.1 mol/L sodium cacodylate buffer and postfixed for 1 h on ice with 1% osmium tetroxide after IR injury. Mitochondrial fission was measured according to our previous study The TUNEL assay was used to detect cellular death following the IR injury. First, we observed the changes in DUSP1 expression before and after the IR injury. WT mice and DUSP1 To gain more solid evidence, we used H9C2 cells to mimic the IR injury in vitro via hypoxia reoxygenation (HR) model. After 2-h hypoxia and 6-h reoxygenation, the DUSP1 expression was significantly reduced when compared to the control group ( In addition to the cell death, we further detected markers of cardiac injury, including LDH, Troponin T and CK-MB, which are indicators of the extent of IR injury in the clinic. Compared with the WT mice, the DUSP1 To provide more direct evidence for the cardio-protective action of DUSP1, we observed the cardiomyocytes properties in WT and the DUSP1 To explain the protective effects of DUSP1 on IR injury, we focused on mitochondrial fission, which is the target of IR injury. To explain the role of fission in cellular damage under IR injury, we focused on the mitochondria-dependent cellular apoptosis. Interestingly, IR mainly increased Mff receptors rather than the other receptors, and the reintroduction of DUSP1 decreased the expression of Mff but not of mitochondrial fission 1 (Fis1), mitochondrial dynamics proteins of 49 kDa or 51 kDa (Mid49 and Mid51) ( DUSP1 handled fission via JNK/Mff pathways. Inhibition of JNK via SP600125 (SP) reversed the upregulation of Mff under the IR stimulation ( To further explore how DUSP1/JNK modified the Mff content, we first examined Mff gene transcription. Surprisingly, coimmunopre-cipitation (co-IP) assay showed a constitutive interaction between endogenous p-JNK and Bnip3 in H9C2 cells under HR injury ( Next, through co-staining of mitochondria and lysosome, we further demonstrated that JNK inhibition facilitated the disassociation between mitochondria and lysosome in the context of HR injury ( Ample evidence highlights the involvement of DUSP1 in the pathophysiological process of cancer IR injury caused DUSP1 downregulation, leading to an increase in JNK phosphorylation. However, recovery of DUSP1 activity could cut off the excessive fission and mitophagy, providing pro-survival advantages for the heart in the context of IR injury. The DUSP protein family comprises 11 members and three classes (Class I: DUSP1, 2, 4, and 5 are found in the nucleus; Class II: DUSP6, 7, and 9 are found in the cytoplasm; and class III: DUSP8, 10, and 16 are found both in the nucleus and cytoplasm) Mitochondrial fission and fragmentation are commonly observed in cells with IR injury The mitochondrial quantity is maintained via mitochondrial dynamics and/or the selective clearance of damaged organelles Ample evidences have confirmed that mitochondrial fission could promote the mitophagy via inducing mitochondria division into several small debris In conclusion, IR injury was associated with degraded DUSP1 activity, leading to the activation of JNK. Increased JNK enhanced Mff and Bnip3 activation, which caused excessive mitochondrial fission and mitophagy, promoting cellular death under IR injury. The reintroduction of DUSP1 could blunt the JNK pathways and subsequently cut off the Mff-mediated fission and Bnip3-required mitophagy, finally preventing myocardial IR injury The authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest.", "To analyze the role of CK2 in lung cancer cells after IR, we suppressed the CK2 kinase activity with, to date, one of the most specific CK2 inhibitors to date, Quinalizarin. To examine the effect of the down regulation of CK2 on cell apoptosis in A549 and H460 cells after exposure to IR, flow cytometry assays were employed. Effect of the down regulation of CK2 on IR-induced apoptosis. It is well known that the cell cycle distribution influences the cell radiosensitivity and cells in the G2/M phase are the most sensitive to IR. In the combination group, we observed a significant increase in the cell population in G2/M phase (19.01 \u00b1 0.46% in A549 and 35.94 \u00b1 1.21% in H460) compared with that in Quinalizarin group (9.46 \u00b1 0.76% in A549 and 12.82 \u00b1 0.48% in H460) or IR group (9.79 \u00b1 0.76% in A549 and 19.50 \u00b1 0.44% in H460) (Fig. The effect of down regulation of CK2 on the IR-induced cell cycle distribution. The cells were collected 24 h after IR exposure, fixed overnight, stained with RNase and propidium iodide and then the cell cycle distribution was measured by flow cytometry. To analyze the effects of Quinalizarin and IR on cell proliferation, EdU incorporation assays were used in A549 and H460 cells. Figure Effect of down regulation of CK2 and IR on cell proliferation. 24 h after IR, EdU was added for 2 h, and the cells were fixed, permeabilized, labeled with Apollo fluorochrome, and the nuclei were stained with DAPI. DNA DSBs are one of the most important therapeutic functions of IR in killing the cancer cells, and the ability to repair DSB influences cell radiosensitivity. It was reported that CK2 was necessary for 53BP1 foci formation H460 cells (1*10 Protein kinase CK2 was one of the earliest discovered kinases in human history, and aroused people\u2019s attention due to its extensive biological roles It was reported that CK2\u03b1 is ubiquitously expressed in different types of lung cancer cells To explore the impact of the down regulation of CK2 on the radiation response, we employed Quinalizarin, a specific CK2 inhibitor, to inhibit the activity of CK2 Ionizing radiation can induce DNA double-stand breaks, which cause chromosomal breakage, genomic instability, and lots of complicated cellular reactions IR induces cell cycle arrest at the two major DNA damage-dependent cellular checkpoints, G1/S and G2/M. The culture medium was changed to the fresh media 24 h after IR.", "Next we screened proteins suppressing IR-induced 53BP1 focus formation, a marker of DNA damage ( RNF126 consists of 326 amino acids and contains both RING and zinc finger (ZF) domains, both of which are highly conserved between species ( Factors implicated in the DDR are supposed to be inactive when there is no DNA damage. Indeed, functionally active forms of some of the DDR factors, including ATM, CHK2, and MDC1, are determined at the monomer\u2013dimer transition ( The hierarchy of RNF8- and RNF168-mediated ubiquitination-dependent IR-induced 53BP1 focus formation has been well characterized. As shown in Recent studies revealed that some ZF domains are capable of binding to ubiquitin and have been renamed ubiquitin-binding ZNF domains ( So far, we have provided evidence supporting that RNF126 expression not only abolishes IR-induced 53BP1 focus formation but also suppresses ubiquitin conjugation at Lys-13 and Lys-15 in H2A.", "Diminished expression of the KAP gene has been associated to diabetic nephropathy and atherosclerosis In the present report, we have observed that in WT mice hfd induces a MS phenotype that includes severe hypertension and significant body gain weight associated to increased fat mass, highly hypertrophied adipocytes, impaired glucose homeostasis and IR. These results fit with reports describing that RAS over-activation in adipose tissue has a metabolic and inflammatory impact in obesity Up-regulation of IL-6 mRNA in adipose tissue and augmented IL-6 serum levels found in hfd-fed WT mice were blunted in KAP Tg littermates, indicating that KAP beneficial effects preventing hepatic steatosis and IR might be related with its capacity to impair IL-6 production and inactivation of the IL6/gp130 axis in hfd-fed mice. Elevated levels of TNF\u03b1 are detected in the bloodstream and in the peripheral tissues of insulin-resistant mice and, both, TNF\u03b1 neutralization and deficiency each prevent high-fat diet-induced IR It is intriguing to understand the sometimes opposite metabolic actions of KAP in basal and in hfd conditions. After washing with PBS, coverslips were mounted on a glass slide and images were obtained using a Leica DM IRBE confocal microscope. pHA-CMV/KAP-HA transiently transfected PCT3 cells were incubated with Methionine and Cysteine depleted labelling media for 30 min, and further incubated with 0,1 mCi/ml Trans 35 Viruses were generated in HEK293T cells with four plasmids providing vector, gag-pol and env functions at a ratio of 1:1:3:5 (VSVG:RTR2:PKGPIR:Transfer vector encoding for KAP fused to the HA epitope), as previously described Control and KAP-HA expressing HK-2 cells were washed with PBS and lysed in whole-cell lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM \u03b2-glycerophospate, 10% glycerol, 1 mM NaVO Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.0d (GraphPad Software, USA).", "The pathophysiology of IR-induced renal disorders involves inflammation, oxidative stress and damage to the vascular endothelium and tubule epithelium [ The present study was conducted to examine the protective effects of mallow hydro-alcoholic extract against the renal injuries caused by ischemia-reperfusion and its consequent remote liver injury in rats. The rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 7), including the sham control group, which received normal saline and underwent a sham surgery, the IR (Ischemia-Reperfusion) group, which received normal saline and 30-minutes of bilateral renal ischemia, and three IR+M groups, which received mallow extract at doses 200, 400 and 600 mg/kg of BW half an hour before ischemia was induced with a protocol similar to the protocol that was used for administering normal saline to the IR group. Plasma concentrations of urea was also significantly reduced the in all three groups receiving mallow extract, although its effect was the highest in the IR+M200 group ( Plasma concentrations of urea in the three groups receiving mallow extract were still significantly higher than the value in the sham group (P<0.01 for the IR+M200 group, and P<0.001 for the IR+M400 and IR+M600 groups). It is worth noting that plasma urea concentrations in the IR+M400 and IR+M600 groups were significantly higher than in IR+M200 group. Renal IR led to a significant rise in plasma concentrations of ALP and ALT ( Data is presented as mean \u00b1 SE (n = 7). Renal IR led to a rise in the mRNA expression of TNF-\u03b1 and ICAM-1 in the renal cortical tissue ( Representative semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of mRNA encoding tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (A) in the renal cortex of the sham group (lane 2) and rats that underwent ischemia/reperfusion after pretreatment with normal saline (lane 3) or malva silvestris extract at 200, 400, or 600 mg/kg (lanes 4\u20136, respectively). Furthermore, leukocyte infiltration increased significantly in the IR group compared to the sham group ( Magnification: 400X. * ** Furthermore, renal IR resulted in severe leukocyte infiltration, cell necrosis and congestion in the liver tissue ( (Haematoxylin-Eosin, 400x). The lipid peroxidation level (MDA level) was significantly higher in the IR group compared to in the sham group (P<0.01), and the 200-mg dose of mallow extract reduced it to the same level as in the sham group (P<0.05). The total antioxidant capacity of the kidney tissue was significantly lower in the IR group as compared to the sham group, as indicated by the lower level of FRAP in the IR group (P<0.001). The FRAP level increased significantly in the IR+M200 and IR+M400 groups and reached the same level as in the sham group (P<0.001); however, it was lower in the IR+M600 group compared to the sham group ( The high mortality rate associated with AKI and its high risk in hospitalized patients necessitate design of strategies for better perception and treatment of this condition. Many studies have shown that renal IR leads to AKI by causing inflammation, oxidative stress and vascular endothelium and tubular epithelium injuries [ In the present study, IR increased expression of the pro-inflammatory factors TNF-\u03b1 and ICAM-1, and leukocyte infiltration in the interstitial space. In the renal IR model, reduced blood flow in the peritubular capillaries leads to tubular hypoxia and stimulates oxidative stress [ Researchers have also shown that mallow flower extract has antioxidant properties likely owing to polyphenols, vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, some polysaccharides and essential fatty acids, especially omega-3 and Omega-6 [ In our study, renal IR led to a significant AKI as evidenced by increases in plasma creatinine and urea concentrations as compared to the sham group. The hydro-alcoholic extract of mallow was therefore found to have protective effects in the kidney against IR-induced damage, as well as, remote liver damage.", "They were sham-operated, IR, crocin pre-treatment, and crocin pretreatment+IR groups. IR and crocin pretreatment+IR groups received N/S and crocin with the same dose, time, and route, respectively, then rats underwent partial (70%) ischemia for 45 min that was followed by reperfusion for 60 min. The results of the present study showed that crocin pre-treatment significantly increased the activity of antioxidants, decreased the serum levels of liver enzymes and blood urea nitrogen following IR-induced hepatic injury. Crocin also ameliorated kidney\u2019s histopathological disturbance beyond IR-induced hepatic injury. Crocin as an antioxidant agent protected renal insult following liver IR injury by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes, reducing serum levels of liver enzymes, and improving histopathological changes. These enzymes have protective effects against IR-induced cell insult through scavenging of ROS in intracellular space ( In recent years, phytomedicine has become an alternative remedy in developing countries for various aspects of health management ( Crocin ( Chemical structure of crocin (C Therefore, the protective effect of crocin as a potent antioxidant against renal IR-induced injury is well documented but to the best of our knowledge, its action on renal injury following liver IR-induced damage has not been determined. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of hepatic IR injury on the activity of antioxidant enzymes, biochemical factors, and histopathological changes in the rat kidney, and to investigate the effect of crocin on IR-related changes.

Increasing antioxidant enzyme activities of SOD, CAT, and GP It has been shown that the serum levels of AST and ALT elevate beyond IR-induced liver insult ( Consistent with a previous study ( Creatinine is an important biomarker for indicating glomerular filtration rate but it is reported that following hepatic IR injury the serum level of this marker decreased owing to disability of the liver to convert creatine to creatinine; therefore, renal secretion of this parameter was enhanced ( Several studies reported that beyond IR-induced liver injury, mild to moderate changes can occur in the architecture of the renal tissue. These studies reported the structural changes occurred concomitantly with biochemical alterations ( In the present study, we showed that the activity of SOD, CAT, and GPx decreased in the renal tissue after IR-induced hepatic injury. In agreement, one study reported that mRNA expression of SOD and CAT decreased following oxidative stress ( Recently, the authors have shown that crocin pretreatment protected the liver against IR-induced injury through increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx) in liver homogenate in rats ( This study demonstrated that crocin pretreatment has renoprotective action following IR-induced hepatic injury through increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes, improving renal function tests, and also improving histopathological changes in the kidney tissue.", "Both insulin (100 nM) and pervanadate (100 u-M), a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, induced a marked increase in the phosphorylation at tyrosine residues of IR and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and in 2-deoxy glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

The first step in the signal transduction pathway of insulin action is the binding of insulin to IR^ which leads to au- tophosphorylation and activation of IR tyrosine kinase. Ty- rosine-phosphorylated IR then phosphorylates IRS-1 [I], which, in turn, promotes the association of PI 3-kinase to IRS-1, resulting in an activation of PI 3-kinase [2]. This is mediated through binding of SH2 domains of p85 regula- tory subunit of PI 3-kinase to tyrosine phosphorylation sites in YXXM motifs of IRS-1. The degree of phosphorylation on tyrosine residues of IRS-1 it thought to determine the degree of cellular response to insulin.

Pervanadate, a potent inhibitor of protein tyrosine phos- phatase, mimics those insulin effects m rat adipocytes [4, 5] and reduces the blood glucose level in streptozotocin- treated diabetic rats [6] possibly through inhibition of pro- tein tyrosine phosphatase, thereby permitting tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of IR kinase [4, 5, 7-9]. It has also been reported that pervanadate induces tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and activation of PI 3-kinase upon its association with IRS-1 in intact rat livers [10]. Antibodies against phosphotyrosine (4G10) and IRS-1 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY, U.S.A.). The supematants were subjected to immunoprecipitation of IR, IRS-1, or tyrosine-phosphory- lated proteins with specific antibodies, or were diluted with equal volume of two times concentrated Laemmli sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation of IR, IRS-1, and Tyrosine-Phosphorylated Proteins from 3T3-L1 Adipocyte Extracts IR, IRS-1, and tyrosine- phosphorylated proteins in the cell extracts were immunocomplexed with anti-IR antibody, anti-IRS-1 antibody, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10), respectively. Immune complexes with anti-IR antibody and anti-IRS-1 antibody were solubilized in 120 |xL of Laemmli sample buffer. Effect of Wortmannin on Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Cellular Proteins and PI 3-Kinase Activity Stimulated by Insulin and V/H m 3T3-L1 Adipocytes Exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to insulin (100 nM) mark- edly increased not only phosphorylation at cyrosine residues of specific cellular proteins including IR and IRS-1 (Fig. V/H mim- icked these effects of insulin in a concentration-dependent manner, and all the V/H-induced insulin-like effects on hexose transport, tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and 1RS-1, and PI 3-kinase activity were detectable at concentrations as low as 10 u,M (Figs. 1, 6 and 7), suggesting that at this concentration these insulin-like effects may be mediated through tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of IR.

This may be explained by the fact that V/H, at higher concen- trations, increased the level of tyrosine phosporylation not only of IR and IRS-1 but also of many other cellular pro- teins (Figs.

The levels of tyrosine phosphorylation ofIR and IRS-1 induced by V/H (100 |JiM) were comparable to those induced by insulin (100 nM), and were equally suppressed by ST-638 (Fig. 8B) may be mediated through inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular protein(s), which is (are) distinct from IR tyrosine kinase and IRS-1. One is the well- established pathway (pathway I) be- ginning from sequential phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1 followed by activation of PI 3-kinase through the final step of hexose transport.

In control animals, muscle obtained 2 min after intravenous injection of a maximally stimulating dose of insulin demonstrated a marked increase in the amount of phosphorylated IR (approximately 5-fold), IRS-1 (approximately 10-fold), and MAP kinase (approximately 10-fold). Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IR, IRS-1, and MAP kinase was markedly diminished (approximately 75%, 90%, and 78%, respectively) in LPS-treated rats.", "Although, the termini of IR-caused DSBs require processing before ligation, NHEJ is the major mechanism used to repair DSBs produced by IR . Two distinct systems have been identified to catalyze NHEJ: the RAD50 complex, which consists of RAD50, MRE11, SIR2 and the product of the NBS1 gene, and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA\u2013PK)\u2013DSB-repair complex, which consists of the 350 kDa catalytic subunit (DNA\u2013PKcs) and two DNA binding subunits, Ku80 and Ku70 . In bacteria, IR triggers the SOS response leading to the expression of several genes in the SOS regulon and the induction of DNA repair . In mammalian cells, IR triggers cell-cycle checkpoints at G/S, S and G/M , which allow irradiated cells time to process and repair DNA damage. IR also induces apoptosis, or programmed cell death , which eliminates cells that may have sustained excessive damage. Evidence of IR-induced DNA repair was disclosed initially from studies indicating that pre-treatment of mammalian cells with X-ray doses as low as 0.01 Gy produces transient protection of the cells as manifested by increased survival and decreased chromosome aberrations after a subsequent, higher dose. Later, it was demonstrated that pre-exposure of mammalian cells to low doses of IR altered the cells' DSB-repair abilities (efficiency and fidelity) . More recently, IR exposure has been shown to induce the formation of the RAD50 or RAD51 complex , which catalyzes homologous recombination. Thus, both RAD50 and DNA\u2013PK DSB-repair complexes may play important roles in the response of mammalian cells to IR damage. Cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and induced DNA-repair are evoked in a coordinated fashion and are mediated by interrelated signal pathways activated by IR . Several signaling pathways including the stress activated protein kinase (SAPK) , ceramide-dependent , and NF-\u03baB have been shown to be activated by IR. The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein, the product of the ATM gene which is mutated in radiosensitive disorder ataxia telangiectasia (A\u2013T), has been identified to play a central role in controlling IR responses of cells . The ceramide and SAPK pathways have been implicated in IR-induced apoptosis. Concurrently, IR activates protein kinase C (PKC), which inhibits apoptosis . IR-caused cell-cycle arrest may also involve multiple signaling pathways. The exact signaling mechanism(s) that lead to p53 induction are not as clear, nor are the signaling mechanism(s) for S and G\u2013M arrest, but replication protein A (RPA), which is phosphorylated following IR exposure , plays a role in S-phase arrest. G\u2013M arrest is mediated by IR-induced suppression of cyclin B expression, a process that is inhibited by the protein-kinase inhibitor staurosporine . Of the signaling pathways that mediate the physiological responses to IR, those involved in the induction of DNA repair are among the least understood. In this study, we investigated the involvement of caM-dependent signaling pathway(s) in IR induction of DSB repair. Previously, we reported that exposure to low-dose \u03b3-radiation enhances DSB-repair fidelity in normal human lymphoblasts but not in IR-sensitive cells from patients with ataxia telangiectasia . One defect that is consistently found in A\u2013T cells is the failure of IR to inhibit DNA replication , and IR-induced DNA-replication inhibition is mediated by caM-dependent pathway(s) . Because IR inhibition of DNA synthesis and enhanced DSB-repair fidelity are defective in A\u2013T cells, the linkage between DNA replication and repair, and the role of caM-dependent pathways in mediating the inhibition of the former by IR, we reasoned that caM-dependent pathways might contribute to the IR-modulation of DSB repair. RI-linearized pZ189 is repaired by NHEJ and has been used previously to demonstrate IR modulation of DSB repair in human lymphoblasts . The results support a role for caM/cAMP-dependent pathway(s) in mediating IR modulation of DSB-repair fidelity. In experiments to determine the effect of pathway blockers on IR-induced DNA repair, host cells were incubated with a drug 30-min prior to irradiation and for 0 or 2 h during the post-irradiation incubation. caM mediates IR inhibition of DNA replication . To determine if caM-dependent signal-transduction pathway(s) also mediates IR-modulation of DSB-repair fidelity, we evaluated the effects of caM antagonists on DSB-repair fidelity of human lymphoblast cells. compares the mutation frequencies in progenies of DSB-containing pZ189 (linDNA) processed by human lymphoblast lines GM607 and GM2184, which had been unirradiated or exposed to 0.5 Gy IR in the presence or absence of cAM antagonists. Also, treatment of GM607 hosts with another caM antagonist, W-13, completely eliminated the IR-induced decrease in linDNA mutation frequency. To further examine the decrease in linDNA mutation frequency, irradiated host cells were treated with the Ca/caM-dependent protein Kinase II (caM Kinase II) inhibitor KN-62 which blocks IR inhibition of DNA replication in human fibroblasts . In contrast to W-7 or W-13 treatment of GM607 cells with KN-62 up to 10 \u03bcM ( =900 nM) before irradiation did not prevent IR from reducing linDNA mutation frequencies . The involvement of the caM-dependent phosphodiesterase in IR-enhanced mutation frequency was investigated using its inhibitor, vinpocetine. Because vinpocetine inhibited the IR reduction in mutation frequency, hosts were treated with cAMP analogue 8-bromo-cAMP. In GM607 hosts , incubation with 8-Br-cAMP before irradiation inhibited the IR reduction in mutation frequency. The effect of 8-Br-cAMP was dose-dependent; IR enhancement of linDNA rejoining fidelity was completely inhibited at a concentration of 2.0 mM. The effect of IR on DSB-repair fidelity is time-dependent ; IR enhances DSB-rejoining fidelity and reduces linDNA mutation frequency if transfection occurs immediately after irradiation but diminishes fidelity and increases mutation frequency if transfection is delayed for 2 h. shows the mutation frequencies in progeny of DSB-containing pZ189 (linDNA) processed by GM607 hosts, unirradiated or exposed to 0.5 Gy \u03b3-radiation. Treatment with W-7 or genistein did not block the IR-caused increase in linDNA mutation frequencies. Pre-treatment with staurosporine, however, blocked the increase in linDNA mutation frequency when transfection was delayed 2 h. We have shown that IR exposure of human lymphoblasts enhances their DSB-repair fidelity soon after irradiation but diminishes it later . Although IR is thought to induce DNA repair through signal-transduction pathway(s) , the specific pathways involved are unknown. Here we show that calmodulin/cAMP-dependent and PKC-dependent signaling pathways mediate IR modulation of DSB-repair fidelity. To study the signal-pathway(s) that govern(s) IR-induced DSB repair, human lymphoblasts were exposed to \u03b3-radiation in the presence or absence of caM antagonists or protein kinase inhibitors and were used as hosts to process shuttle vector pZ189 containing one, restriction-endonuclease-caused DSB (linDNA). Thus, IR enhanced DSB-rejoining fidelity. Treatment of host cells with the caM antagonists W-7 or W-13 for 30 min prior to irradiation completely blocked this IR-enhancement of linDNA rejoining fidelity (, ). In contrast, treatment of host cells with the protein kinase inhibitors staurosporine or genistein did not block the IR enhancement of linDNA rejoining fidelity. IR increases linDNA mutation frequency in progeny plasmids when transfection occurs 2 h after rather than immediately after irradiation . Together, these findings indicate that IR modulates DSB-repair fidelity in mammalian cells through at least two pathways \u2014 one that involves caM and initially enhances repair fidelity and another that involves PKC and later diminishes repair fidelity. caM mediates mammalian cell responses to IR, such as inhibition of DNA replication . In this study, IR-enhanced DSB-rejoining fidelity was inhibited by the PDE inhibitor vinpocetine but not by the caM kinase II inhibitor KN-62 . Thus, IR-enhanced DSB repair may be mediated by PDE and not by caM kinase II. In support of this, treatment of hosts with cell-permeable cAMP analogue 8-bromo-cAMP also inhibited IR-enhanced DSB-rejoining fidelity . IR enhancement of DSB-rejoining fidelity was also inhibited by forskolin, which increases cAMP levels (data not shown). Because caM antagonists W-7 and W-13 inhibit PDE activity (IC=28 mM and 68 mM, respectively), W-7 and W-13 may block IR enhancement of DSB-rejoining fidelity by inhibiting Ca/caM-dependent phosphodiesterase activity. This indicates that these drugs affect the cells' constitutive DSB-repair capabilities and supports our earlier contention that the accuracy of DSB repair by mammalian cells can be either increased or decreased as seen after IR exposure . When hosts were irradiated, however, these drugs blocked IR enhancement of DSB-rejoining fidelity. These drugs, therefore, may modulate the effect of IR on the hosts' constitutive DSB-repair machinery rather than on the hosts' signaling pathways. Cells exposed to KN-62, alone, showed an increase in linDNA background mutation frequencies, which IR exposure reversed \u2014 the same response shown by control cells . Furthermore, GM607 hosts treated with W-7 at 25 \u03bcM, a concentration that doubled the background mutation frequency, continued to respond to IR with lower mutation frequencies . Thus W-7, W-13, vinpocetine and 8-Br-cAMP appear to affect constitutive and IR-enhanced DSB-repair fidelities by different mechanisms. Our data show the involvement of PKC- and caM/cAMP-dependent pathways in mediating IR modulation of DSB-repair fidelity. PKC activity increases soon following exposure of mammalian cells to IR . In fact, PKC also mediates IR-induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis . cAMP levels in mammalian cells are affected by IR exposure , and subsequent cAMP signaling occurs through several proteins, including cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). PKA, in fact, has been implicated in the response of mammalian cells to IR : IR decreases PKA activity in Burkitt's lymphoma cells, and PKA inhibitors increase IR-induced apoptosis. demonstrated that cAMP, via PKA activation, inhibits IR activation of caspase in mouse and rat embryo fibroblasts (caspases cleave several proteins, called \u201cdeath substrates\u201d during apoptosis ). We have reported that A\u2013T cells do not exhibit the IR-enhancement of linDNA-repair fidelity immediately after irradiation . Because our present findings implicate a cAM/cAMP-dependent signaling pathway in IR-enhanced, DSB-repair fidelity, this suggests that a defective cAM/cAMP-dependent signaling pathway may exist in A\u2013T cells. In conclusion, our data indicate the involvement of PKC- and caM/cAMP-dependent pathways in mediating IR modulation of DSB-repair fidelity. However, these findings may reflect effects of IR on independent DSB-repair pathways. It is noteworthy that ATM is required for the assembly of the RAD51 HR complex , which is stimulated by IR. As stated, A\u2013T cells lack the cAM/cAMP-dependent, IR-enhanced DSB-repair fidelity , a defect that is attributable to defective ATM. It is plausible that our findings reflect effects of IR on HR and NHEJ repair processes.", "We show that in human cells, Chk1 is phosphorylated on serine 345 (S345) in response to UV, IR, and hydroxyurea (HU).", "Using CGRP and CB staining as markers for two different sensory components of the innervation of NEBs, it was revealed that P2X(3) receptor and CB immunoreactivity were colocalized, whereas CGRP-IR fibers clearly formed a different population. The disappearance of characteristic P2X(3) receptor-positive nerve fibers in contact with NEBs after infranodosal vagal crush and colocalization of tracer and P2X(3) receptor immunoreactivity in vagal nodose neuronal cell bodies in retrograde tracing experiments further supports our hypothesis that the P2X(3) receptor-IR nerve fibers contacting NEBs have their origin in the vagal sensory nodose ganglia. Combination of quinacrine accumulation in NEBs, suggestive of the presence of high concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in their secretory vesicles, and P2X(3) receptor staining showed that the branching intraepithelial P2X(3) receptor-IR nerve terminals in rat lungs were exclusively associated with quinacrine-stained NEBs. Further studies are necessary to determine whether the P2X(3) receptor-expressing neurons, specifically innervating NEBs in the rat lung, belong to a population of P2X(3) receptor-IR nociceptive vagal nodose neurons.", "Insulin stimulation (1 nmol/l) of IR kinase and PI 3-kinase were maximal within 5 min (approximately 8- and 5-fold over basal, respectively), and insulin activation of PKB was maximal within 15 min (approximately 3.5-fold over basal).", "Loss of functional Nbs1 in NBS patients prevents the formation of the radiation-induced hMre11/hRad50 nuclear foci (IRIF) (). However, the evidence in demonstrating that ScMre11 functions in DSB repair prompted us to investigate whether the IR sensitivity of ATLD cells was attributable to DSB repair deficiency. Therefore, the IR sensitivity observed in the ATLD patients does not appear to result from gross deficiency in DSB repair. JNK activity present in whole-cell extracts from IR-treated LCLs was tested with a GST-jun substrate. Whereas JNK activity in normal cells was stimulated approximately 6-fold by IR, this activity was essentially unaffected by IR treatment of NBS and ATLD cells (). Consistent with previous analyses, IR-induced activation of JNK in A-T cells was not observed in this assay (). We derived -Q623Z- (ATLD1/2) and -N113S- (ATLD3/4) expressing strains and examined them with respect to mitotic function (sensitivity to IR) and meiotic function (spore viability). The C-terminal truncation allele, -Q623Z, exhibited wild-type resistance to IR, consistent with previous studies demonstrating that deletion of the C terminus of ScMre11 has very little impact on Mre11 function(s) in mitotic cells (). In contrast, the N-terminal missense mutation, -N113S, conferred significant IR sensitivity (). Previous studies have shown that members of the hMre11/hRad50/Nbs1 protein complex become associated with DSBs early in the cellular DNA damage response (), and that these proteins form nuclear foci in response to IR and other DSB inducing agents (). Ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) formation is reduced in A-T cells, and this activity is abrogated in Nbs1-deficient fibroblasts (). Given the phenotypic similarities among A-T, NBS, and ATLD cells, we examined IRIF formation in cell lines established from ATLD patients. IRIF were subsequently visualized by immunofluorescence. We have also shown that Rad51 IRIF form normally in NBS cells (unpublished data). The IMR90 control line exhibited 84% and 74% positive nuclei for Nbs1 and hMre11 IRIF, respectively, at 8 hr post \u03b3 irradiation, whereas fewer than 3% of nuclei contained IRIF at any time point in the ATLD cell lines (at least 100 nuclei were examined at each time point). The small number of hMre11 and Nbs1 IRIF detected in ATLD cells was aberrantly small and dull (e.g., ). Thus, the IRIF response of ATLD cells expressing these mutant alleles was essentially abrogated. For example, it has been shown that A-T cells are deficient in the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) following exposure to IR (). The activation of JNK after exposure to IR was found to be defective in all four ATLD cell lines as well as in the NBS cell line and comparable to that exhibited by classical A-T cells. We found that the formation of IRIF of hMre11 and Nbs1 was essentially abrogated in ATLD fibroblasts. The bulk of evidence suggests that IRIF formation reflects the association of the complex with DNA damage, and that the emergence of IRIF relatively long after IR treatment reflects the presence of slowly repaired or irreparable lesions (). Therefore, the coincidence of aberrant IRIF formation and deficiency in the activation of DNA damage responses provides further support for the hMre11/hRad50/Nbs1 protein complex as a sensor of DNA damage that is critical for activation of cell cycle checkpoint functions mediated by ATM.", "In vitro, when PC-1 is transfected and overexpressed in cultured cells, it inhibits IR tyrosine kinase activity. To determine the mechanism whereby PC-1 regulates the IR, we studied how PC-1 interacts with this protein. Overexpression of PC-1 in MCF-7 cells inhibited tyrosine kinase activity of the IR, but not of the IGF-I receptor. When the IR was immunocaptured by specific IR monoclonal antibodies, PC-1 was associated with this receptor. We next studied HTC cells that were overexpressing an IR alpha-subunit mutant. This IR mutant binds insulin but has a deletion in the tyrosine kinase regulatory domain located in amino acids 485-599. In contrast to normal IRs, PC-1 did not associate with this mutant and did not affect tyrosine kinase activity. This treatment decreased PC-1 levels; concomitantly, IR tyrosine kinase activity increased. These studies indicate, therefore, that PC-1 may inhibit the IR by interacting directly with a specific region in the IR alpha-subunit.", "We have also observed a tissue-specific modulation of IR gene expression in an in vivo situation of mineralocorticoid excess in rats . With these antecedents the aim of the present investigation was to examine the possibility of an in vitro MR-mediated effect of aldosterone on IR expression using the U-937 human promonocytic cell line . These cells represent a useful in vitro monocyte-like model for the evaluation of IR expression and its modulation by diverse agents . In particular, we analyse (i) the presence of MR in U-937 cells, (ii) the effect of aldosterone on IR mRNA level and stability, and (iii) its effect on insulin binding and IR turnover in these cells. The probe used was the 4.1-kb human insulin receptor-specific EcoRI fragment of the pHIR/P12-1 clone , obtained through the ATCC. IR mRNA half-life was determined by an actinomycin D decay curve . The accumulations of total IR mRNA were measured by dot-blot assays. The IR mRNA levels were analysed by dot blot assays. Turnover of IRs was assessed by a cycloheximide decay curve in the absence or presence of 10 M aldosterone during 12, 24 and 38 h. Unless otherwise stated, data are expressed as mean\u00b1SEM of at least three determinations. In order to gain insight upon a hypothetical aldosterone action on IR gene expression in U-937 cells, our first purpose was to identify MRs in these cells. Then, we wanted to analyse possible MR-mediated effects of aldosterone on IR gene expression. Thus, U-937 cells were incubated for 24 h with increasing concentrations of this steroid (from 10 M to 10 M) and the IR mRNA levels determined by Northern blot assays ( ). These cells exhibited two major IR mRNA species of approximately 11 and 8.5 kb in size, and a ratio (11 kb/8.5 kb) of 1.20\u00b10.02 in accordance with our previous findings . To assess the time-course of aldosterone inhibition of IR mRNA levels, U-937 cells were incubated for up to 48 h with 10 M aldosterone ( ). This steroid produced an inhibition in the levels of both IR mRNA species, which was first observed at 24 h of treatment (30% decrease), reaching the 100% of inhibition 48 h after addition of hormone (). These results demonstrated that aldosterone regulated IR gene expression at the RNA level in a dose- and time- dependent manner in U-937 cells. The involvement of the MR in the aldosterone-induced inhibition of IR mRNA levels was investigated by blocking the MR with the mineralocorticoid antagonist spironolactone at a concentration of 10 M for 24 h ( ). We observed that the combined administration of aldosterone plus spironolactone partially abolished the inhibition of IR gene expression exerted by aldosterone alone. Spironolactone, itself, also caused a decrease in IR mRNA levels but to a lesser extent than aldosterone (). Thus, the MR was shown to be involved in the aldosterone-elicited decrease in IR mRNA levels in U-937 cells. To further assess the mechanisms of the aldosterone-elicited decrease in IR mRNA levels, we determined whether this effect could be due to a decrease in transcript stability. For this purpose actinomycin D was applied for increasing time-periods to untreated cells and cells treated for 24 h with aldosterone, and the accumulation levels of total IR mRNA was determined by dot-blot assays. Therefore, the aldosterone-elicited decrease in IR mRNA levels may not be explained by a reduction in transcript stability. To determine the possible dependence on protein synthesis of the aldosterone-elicited decrease in IR gene expression, the levels of this RNA were measured by dot-blot assays in untreated cells and in cells treated for 24 h with aldosterone, in the absence or presence of the inhibitor of translation, cycloheximide ( ). In these experiments, cells treated with aldosterone in the absence of cycloheximide showed approximately a 40% reduction of IR mRNA levels. Although cycloheximide decreased the basal levels of IR mRNA, perhaps due to the long duration of the treatment , a reduction of approximately 40% of IR mRNA also occurred in the presence of cycloheximide after treatment with aldosterone. These decreases in the same range in the absence or presence of the translation inhibitor () indicated that the inhibition of IR gene expression was a direct response to the action of aldosterone, not mediated by the prior induction of other gene products. Then, we wanted to analyse whether the decrease in IR mRNA levels could lead to a decrease in insulin binding. In addition, IR affinity, reflected by the IC value (insert in ), was almost identical in both treated and untreated cells (Kd (10 M): 1.20\u00b10.09 vs 1.30\u00b10.17), indicating that the decrease in binding was not related to alterations in receptor affinity. Therefore, the aldosterone-provoked decrease of IR expression at the RNA level was also accompanied by a decrease in IRs at the protein level. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide was used to assess turnover of IRs in the presence or absence of 10 M aldosterone ( ). The IR half-life was approximately 24 h in the absence or presence of the hormone. This showed that aldosterone does not directly affect IR stability. The second part of the investigation allowed us to demonstrate that aldosterone was able to modulate the levels of the two main IR mRNAs (11 and 8.5 kb) present in U-937 cells. However, the effect of aldosterone was biphasic because it increased IR mRNA levels at higher concentrations (10\u201310 M). This hypothesis, is supported by our previous data indicating an increase in IR mRNA levels in U-937 cells by dexamethasone at concentrations of 10\u201310 M. These concentrations are in agreement to the Kd values of glucocorticoid receptors in these cells . Therefore, it is possible to speculate that the in vitro regulation of IR gene expression by aldosterone in U-937 cells involves MRs at physiological concentrations of aldosterone, but also glucocorticoid receptors at higher concentrations. Another fact is that these findings of an in vitro reduction of IR mRNA levels together with our previous in vivo results of a tissue specific modulation of IR mRNA levels in mineralocorticoid-treated rats , suggest that the effect of mineralocorticoids on IR gene expression was highly tissue-specific. The decrease in IR mRNA levels attributed to aldosterone could involve a transcriptional mechanism. Although specific mineralocorticoid response elements have not been identified in the IR gene promoter, several studies have reported the presence of up to five putative glucocorticoid response elements in this promoter . We are presently investigating whether these elements mediate the aldosterone-induced reduction in IR mRNA. The mineralocorticoid antagonist spironolactone was used to study the putative involvement of MR in the aldosterone-provoked decrease of IR mRNA levels. IR mRNA half-life was approximately 4 h in both untreated and aldosterone-treated cells. In this sense we have previously observed that the synthetic steroid dexamethasone did not alter IR mRNA half-life in these cells. Our results indicate that the decrease of IR gene expression in U-937 cells took place in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, suggesting that it occurred as a direct response to the action of the hormone not mediated by the prior induction of other gene products. In a similar manner, we have previously observed that the regulation of IR gene expression by dexamethasone in these cells was not prevented by the simultaneous presence of this protein synthesis inhibitor . This decrease at the translational level was observed in cells treated with 10 M aldosterone for 48 h, conditions that are similar to those previously used for the detection of maximum inhibition of IR mRNA levels by this hormone. This negative regulation of IRs by aldosterone would cause a decrease in the insulin responsiveness in these cells. Finally, IR turnover seemed to be unaffected by aldosterone, since IR protein was estimated to have a half-life of approximately 24 h in both untreated and hormone-treated cells. In conclusion, aldosterone induced an inhibition of IR mRNA levels and insulin binding in U-937 cells, and the effects were mediated by hormone binding to MR. These results represent the first demonstration of an in vitro modulation of human IR expression by aldosterone. The functional significance of this MR-mediated decrease in IR expression is currently being studied in our laboratory.", "are identified by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by detection with fluorescent dyes, autoradiography (for NHEJ methods have been evolving during the last 20 years ( The same source of extract was introduced by The first mammalian in vitro system for NHEJ was described by Soon after in Pfeiffer\u2019s laboratory, synthetic DNA molecules were employed for the first time as repair substrates in the NHEJ assay they had originally developed in 1988 ( Povirk and collaborators ( To meet the technical challenge of designing assays that employ radiation damaged DNA, a unique in vitro NHEJ system was developed by Iliakis and coworkers ( Amongst in vitro systems, the NHEJ assay developed by The in vitro assay developed by In a follow up study, our group has also used DSBs produced by IR and Pfeiffer with coworkers also reported lower efficiency of NHEJ repair with As mentioned earlier, many current in vitro DSBs end joining assays have some limitations with regard to substrate modification. The fact that NHEJ assays can now be applied to clinical samples ( Recent publications apparently show that NHEJ assays are already being used to estimate the potential toxic effect of anticancer drugs and IR in therapies against cancer. NHEJ assays are therefore likely to become increasingly important in the future by serving as the basis for identifying patients that are indicated or not-indicated for IR. This is because of the realization that genetic differences can (a) influence the capacity to repair DNA DSBs, (b) predict susceptibility to cancer/likelihood of cancer recurrence and (c) response to IR.", "In our attempt to illustrate whether NF-\u03baB is associated with the FFA induced phospho-PKC\u025b effect on IR gene downregulation, we detected an increase in NF-\u03baB protein in the skeletal muscle cells incubated with palmitate. palmitate inhibits IR gene and protein expression in skeletal muscle cells, we have found that palmitate phosphorylated PKC\u025b in cytosol which is then translocated to the nuclear region and is associated with the inhibition of IR gene expression .", "The structure of the pH sensitive dye 5-(and-6)-carboxy SNARF\u00ae-1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), is shown in In the MIR-FTIR analysis, fluorescein was the fluorescent reporter molecule used, and SNARF solutions were excited with a 2 W 488 nm argon ion laser (Coherent Innova-90, Evergreen Laser Corporation, Durham, CT, USA).

Thus, elucidation of the detailed molecular mechanisms of IR-induction of is a promising approach for uncovering novel targets of IR-mediated cancer gene therapy. So far several transcription factors have been reported to play a role in gene induction following exposure to IR . While Sp1, AP-1, Oct-1, NF-1 and Egr-1 are responsive to high doses of IR (>1 Gy), activation of TP53 and NF\u03baB by lower doses has been reported . Induction of the gene following exposure to IR requires TP53 . For instance, Sp1, GKLF, Ets1, and IRF-1 have been reported to be involved in transcriptional activation of following exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light or ectopic overexpression of TP53 . However, involvement of such cooperating transcription factors in the regulation of TP53-target genes following exposure to IR is poorly understood. This is primarily because transiently transfected reporter vectors containing the TP53 target gene promoter are much less responsive to IR than the endogenous gene; robust response usually requires the use of hyperlethal IR doses. We recently reported that the IR sensitivity of the exogenous promoter is significantly higher when it is introduced into cells using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors . In the present study, we carried out a comprehensive reporter gene analysis using rAAV vectors, with the goal of identifying transcription factors involved in the regulation of the gene promoter following irradiation with clinically relevant doses of IR. The reporter gene construct containing the 5\u2032 flanking region (\u22122320 bp/+41 bp) of the gene was used to investigate the functional DNA region involved in the TP53-mediated IR response. We have previously shown that the reporter gene constructs are highly responsive to IR when introduced into MCF-7 cells using rAAV vectors. As shown in C, the fold induction of luciferase activity increased linearly with X-ray dose, and the slope was used as an index of IR responsiveness in this study. In comparison, IR responsiveness of cells transduced with rAAV-del2, rAAV-del4 and rAAV-del5 was much lower, with slope values of 0.26, 0.079, and 0.13, respectively. These results strongly suggest that pivotal cis-elements for IR responsiveness of the gene promoter can be mapped to the regions \u22121962 bp/\u22121679 bp (rAAV-del2), \u22121398 bp/\u22121119 bp (rAAV-del4), and \u22121118 bp/\u2212839 bp (rAAV-del5). IR responsiveness of cells transduced with rAAV-del7 and rAAV-del8 was also moderately lower, suggesting that the regions \u2212558 bp/\u2212279 bp and \u2212278 bp/+1 bp may contain cis-elements bound by factors that enhance the activity of the gene promoter after irradiation. In contrast, we found rAAV-del3 to be more IR responsive than wild-type rAAV-PLS. This suggests the presence of a cis-element in the region \u22121678 bp/\u22121399 bp that antagonizes IR induced elevation of promoter activity. It should be noted that Oct-1 is the transcription factor involved in the regulation of IR-responsive genes , , , and endothelial lipase , suggesting that Oct-1 may also play a role in regulating gene transcription by cooperating with TP53. We speculated that these sites were candidates for the cis-elements functioning in the IR response of the gene. E shows that the IR responsiveness of cells transduced with these vectors was significantly lower than wild-type, with slope values of 0.025 (rAAV-del2/Oct1), 0.061 (rAAV-del4/TP53), and 0.17 (rAAV-del5/Oct1). These results indicate that the Oct-1 sites at \u22121.8 kb and \u22121.1 kb and the TP53 site at \u22121.4 kb play essential independent roles in the IR response of the gene promoter. As shown in B and C, the expression of both the basal and IR-inducible components was significantly lower than in cells transfected with the negative control shRNA. In this study, we performed promoter analysis to search for transcription factors involved in the TP53-mediated IR response of the gene in the dose range of 0.2\u20132.0 Gy. We used rAAV vectors for reporter gene analysis because of their robust response to IR. Since the viral genome of rAAV is integrated into the chromosome with a major preference for ribosomal DNA repeats and other hotspots , we believe that the observed sensitivity of the rAAV vector to IR reflects the requirement of TP53 and/or its cooperating transcription factors for a certain chromatin structure at its recognition site. We demonstrated here that Oct-1 plays a role in both basal and IR-induced expression of the gene by constitutively binding to recognition sequences at \u22121.8 kb and \u22121.1 kb. However, the loss of these elements in rAAV-del8 caused only a moderate reduction in IR responsiveness (slope=0.32, C) compared to the substantial reduction in IR responsiveness of rAAV-del2/Oct1 and rAAV-del5/Oct1 (slope=0.025 and 0.17, respectively; E). A significant induction of Oct-1 was observed in PCI-04A carcinoma cells by EMSA after exposure to 5 Gy of IR, but activation by smaller doses has not been previously reported. Here, we show for the first time that Oct-1 is involved in IR regulation of the gene in an irradiation dose range of 0.2\u20132.0 Gy. Combining our present results with the previous report that Oct-1 is functionally activated after IR-irradiation through phosphorylation of its N-terminal domain by DNA-PK , we suggest that the gene is induced by IR through both the ATM/Chk2/p53 and the DNA-PK/Oct-1 pathways. Consistent with this, induction of after exposure to IR was found to be delayed and attenuated in embryonic fibroblasts of the mouse, which harbors a mutation in DNA-PK, although the increase in TP53 level was the same as in normal mouse cells . Fibroblasts lacking Oct-1 are hypersensitive to IR . In the present study, we suggest that the Oct-1-mediated induction of is another pathway leading to IR resistance. The TP53 site at \u22121.4 kb was previously thought to play a limited role in the IR response of the gene because it contains only 1.5 repeats of the consensus recognition sequence for TP53. We were therefore surprised to find that binding of TP53 to this site is indispensable for the IR response (E). Based on observations from a ChIP experiment that binding of TP53 to the \u22122.2 kb site is constitutive (data not shown), we speculate that the binding of TP53 to the \u22121.4 kb site rather than the \u22122.2 kb site contributes more fundamentally to the IR-inducible component of expression.", "In organ culture of human fetal ovaries, the germ cells underwent apoptosis only when exposed to high doses of IR (1.5 Gy and above). IR induced apoptosis similarly in mouse fetal ovaries in organ culture and in vivo during oogonial proliferation. Germ cell survival in testes from p53 knockout or p63 knockout mice exposed to IR was better than wild-type, whereas female germ cell survival was unaffected by p53 or p63 knockout.", "We sought to characterize the effects of physiologic and genetic manipulation of Akt signaling on IR-induced gastrointestinal (GI) apoptosis in mice. Pre-treatment with insulin and glucose did not significantly alter levels of IR-induced apoptosis in the gut. IR alone led to sustained increases in P-Akt in the gut at six hours, a protective response that may have precluded additional protection from insulin/glucose. In Akt1-/- mice, there was significantly more apoptosis in ileum crypts of irradiated mice compared to Akt1+/+ mice, suggesting a role for the pathway in the GI tract in response to IR.", "Recent work indicates that Chk1, the downstream phosphorylation target of ATR, protects cells from apoptosis induced by DNA replication inhibitors as well as IR. The aim of the work reported here was to determine the roles of ATM- and ATR-protein kinase cascades in the control of apoptosis following replication stress and the relationship between Chk1-suppressed apoptotic pathways responding to replication stress or IR. Unlike the Chk1-suppressed pathway responding to IR, the replication stress-triggered apoptotic pathway did not require ATM and is characterized by activation of caspase 3 in both p53-proficient and -deficient cells. Taken together, our results show that the ATR-Chk1 signalling pathway plays a major role in the regulation of death in response to DNA replication stress and that the Chk1-suppressed pathway protecting cells from replication stress is clearly distinguishable from that protecting cells from IR. The related PIK-like kinases ATM ( ATR and its downstream phosphorylation target, Chk1, are generally activated in response to UV and agents that stall DNA replication forks A role for Chk1 in the suppression of apoptosis in response to IR was revealed in a zebrafish embryo-based screen While the role of the ATM signalling cascade in the induction of apoptosis following IR is well established, relatively little is known concerning the contribution of this signalling pathway in response to replication fork stress. The two lanes furthest to the right present caspase 2 and cleaved caspase 3 levels in HCT116 p53\u2212/\u2212 cells depleted of Chk1 exposed or not exposed to 10 Gy IR. As above, the two lanes furthest to the right present caspase 2 and cleaved caspase 3 levels in HCT116 p53\u2212/\u2212 cells depleted of Chk1 exposed or not exposed to 10 Gy IR. Recently it was reported that p53 deficient cells treated with a Chk1 inhibitor or siRNA showed cleavage of caspase 2 but not caspase 3 following exposure to IR while p53+/+ HCT116 cells predominantly showed cleavage of caspase 3 To determine whether the induction of apoptosis was dependent upon caspase 3 activation following thymidine exposure, Chk1 depleted HCT116 or SW480 cells exposed to thymidine were treated with the caspase 3 inhibitor II (Z-DEVD-FMK). In such cultures the accumulation of cells with a subG1 content ( Recent work has shown that mice carrying a carboxyl terminus deletion of NBS1 are defective in apoptosis in many tissues and in response to IR A) Nbs1 and Chk1 protein levels in HCT116 cells after 48 hours treatment with the siRNAs for the two proteins. BID showed nuclear localization and was phosphorylated in an ATM-dependent manner following DNA damage in myeloid progenitor cells derived from wild type mice The data reported here show that the apoptotic pathway suppressed by Chk1 in response to replication inhibitors is clearly distinguishable from both the classical intrinsic death pathway and the Chk1-suppressed IR death response ( Replication stress developing as a result of DSB formation or processing triggers the ATR/Chk1 protein kinase cascade that suppresses an ATM- and ATR-dependent cleavage of caspase 2 and cell death (left, from Given the lethal effects of loss of Chk1 function on tumour cells exposed to DNA replication inhibitors, there has been interest in the use of Chk1 inhibitors in chemotherapy.", "Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03ba\u0392) transcription factors are upregulated by IR and have been implicated in radioresistance. The handling of these two cell lines in this manner has been supported by the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital IRB. A 10\u22361 total lipid to curcumin ratio (weight/weight) was used The effects of curcumin and IR on cell viability were determined by an Alamar Blue viability assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rh30 and Rh41 cells were pretreated with varying doses of liposomal curcumin (10, 25 and 50 \u00b5M) for varying lengths of time (0, 3 and 24 hr) prior to receiving a single dose of 10 Gy IR. We next sought to determine the effects of curcumin and IR on the proliferation of the ARMS cell lines. Apoptosis in control cells was 6.63%\u00b10.66 as compared to 10.1%\u00b11.6, or 9.9%\u00b10.8 in cells treated with radiation or curcumin alone, while the combination of radiation and curcumin resulted in 22.9%\u00b11.5 apoptosis (p = .0001) ( Since the classical NF-\u03ba\u0392 pathway involves the degradation of I\u03baB, we investigated whether radiation induced I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation in IR-treated rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Western blot showed IR induced a decrease in cellular I\u03baB\u03b1 levels within 1 hr and I\u03baB\u03b1 levels returned to control levels by 4 hr ( (A) Western blot showing radiation induces degradation of I\u03ba\u03b2\u03b1 in a time dependent manner in both Rh30 and Rh41 cell lines. We next performed western blot analysis to determine whether curcumin modulated these target proteins in rhabdomyosarcoma cells treated with IR. This analysis revealed that, while radiation induced the expression of cyclin D1, COX-2, MMP-9, XIAP, and Bcl-2, curcumin treatment suppressed their induction by radiation ( To further demonstrate the functional role of the radiation-induced canonical NF-\u03ba\u0392 pathway, the effect of IR on proliferation of Rh30 and Rh41cells expressing the I\u03baB\u03b1 super-repressor was analyzed. The Rh30 and Rh41 cells expressing the I\u03baB\u03b1 super-repressor were significantly more sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of 10 Gy IR when compared to the control (empty-vector expressing) cells and cells expressing the p100 super-repressor. The Rh41 EV and SR-p100 cell line had 11.66\u00b10.9% and 12.8\u00b10.5% Annexin V positive cells, respectively, as compared to 21.3\u00b11.5% Annexin V positive cells in the I\u03baB\u03b1 super-repressor cell line (p = 0.0007) ( We next determined whether curcumin sensitized rhabdomyosarcoma to IR (A) The combination of curcumin and radiation had synergistic antitumor activity in the Rh30 xenografts (synergistic index = \u22120.940, SE 0.072, 95% confidence interval \u22121.080, \u22120.799). Approximately 1 month after injection, mice bearing tumors of each cell line were size-matched into 2 groups, one group was subjected to IR (n = 10) while the other served as control. In the control tumors and tumors derived from the p100 super-repressor expressing cells exposed to IR, there was an increase in the NF-\u03ba\u0392 activity, specifically in complexes containing the p50 and p65 subunits. Tumors derived from I\u03baB\u03b1-SR cells were 94% smaller when IR was given, compared untreated xenografts (mean tumor volume = 62.4\u00b110.8 mm Radiation therapy is a critical component of the multimodality approach to the treatment of many solid tumors, including rhabdomyosarcoma. Thus, inhibition of NF-\u03ba\u0392 activity has the potential to sensitize tumor cells to IR. In the two alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines used in our study, IR upregulated NF-\u03ba\u0392 activity in both a time (maximally at 2 hours) and dose (10 Gy) dependent manner. We confirmed that IR-mediated induction of NF-\u03ba\u0392 activity occurred via the classical pathway in experiments with enforced expression of super repressor constructs which showed abrogation of radiation-mediated NF-\u03ba\u0392 activation in cell lines transduced with an SR-I\u03baB\u03b1 mutant (canonical) but not an SR-p100 (non-canonical) mutant. Treatment with curcumin, a naturally occurring inhibitor of NF-\u03ba\u0392 activity, prior to the delivery of ionizing radiation, inhibited the upregulation of NF-\u03ba\u0392 activity in the ARMS cell lines and xenografts in response to IR, as demonstrated by EMSA. This in turn led to increased IR-mediated tumor cell apoptosis and antitumor efficacy. We found maximal induction of NF-\u03ba\u0392 activation two hours after the delivery of ionizing radiation to ARMS cells In addition to demonstrating that blocking activation of NF-\u03ba\u0392 by curcumin resulted in IR-mediated induction of NF-\u03ba\u0392-responsive genes involved in cell proliferation (cyclin D1) and survival (XIAP and bcl-2), we showed that the combination of curcumin and IR caused a profound decrease in microvessel density in rhabdomyosarcoma xenografts. Thus, the mechanism of synergy between curcumin and IR is likely to be multifactorial and involves direct tumor cell cytotoxicity, inhibition of angiogenesis as well as radiosensitization.", "To analyze IR-induced cell death, dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and DNA fragmentation were determined by flow cytometry. IR induced caspase-dependent cleavage of the translational initiation factors eIF4G1, eIF3A, and eIF4B resulting in disassembly of the cap-dependent initiation complex. In addition, DAP5-dependent initiation complex that regulates IRES-dependent translation was disassembled in response to IR. Moreover, IR resulted in dephosphorylation of 4EBP1, an inhibitor of cap-dependent translation upstream of caspase activation. However, knock-down of eIF4G1, eIF4B, DAP5, or 4EBP1 did not affect IR-induced decline of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. Our data shows that cap-dependent translation is regulated at several levels in response to IR. However, the experiments indicate that IR-induced Mcl-1 decline is not a consequence of translational inhibition in Jurkat cells. Using Jurkat T lymphoma cells as a cell model, we examined protein translation and Mcl-1 levels in response to IR. To analyze cap-dependent protein translation in response to IR, Jurkat T lymphoma cells were irradiated with 10 Gy. Down-regulation of 4EBP1 was verified by Western blot (Figure Protein translation is frequently deregulated in tumor cells and accelerates tumorigenesis [ IR-induced cleavage of eIF4G1, eIF4B, eIF3A, and DAP5 coincided with disassembly of the cap-/eIF4G1-dependent and IRES-/DAP5-dependent initiation complex in Jurkat cells. Thus, a switch from cap-/eIF4G1-dependent to IRES-/DAP5-dependent translation, as suggested before [ In addition to caspase-dependent regulation, caspase-independent regulation of cap-dependent translation was observed in irradiated Jurkat cells. Apart from that, IR resulted in 4EBP1 dephosphorylation without affecting S6K in Jurkat cells suggesting an additional regulation of protein translation. Mcl-1 ubiquitin ligase E3 (Mule) and the Skip/Cullin/F-Box ligase complex containing \u03b2-transducin repeat-containing protein (\u03b2-TrCP) or FBW7 were able to ubiquitylate Mcl-1 and target the protein for proteosomal degradation [ In summary, our results indicate that IR inhibited cap-/eIF4G1-dependent and DAP5-dependent translation in Jurkat cells. The mechanism leading to translational inhibition in response to IR involved caspase-dependent cleavage of eIF4G1, eIF4B, eIF3A, and DAP5 as well as caspase-independent dephosphorylation of 4EBP1. IR-induced decrease of phosphorylated 4EBP1 did not result from inhibition of Akt and mTOR but probably from increased phosphatase activity. The effects of IR on protein translation are summarized in Figure Mcl-1: Myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1; IR: Ionizing radiation; eIF: Eukaryotic initiation factor; DAP5: Death associated protein 5; 4EBP1: eIF4E binding protein 1; IRES: Internal ribosome entry site; mTOR: Mammalian target of rapamycin; ERK1/2: Extracellular regulated kinase 1/2; CHX: Cycloheximide.", "In addition, this MAPK seems to be implicated in different biological responses to IR like bystander effects or senescence . Abundant literature has demonstrated activation of p38 MAPK upon IR treatment and its implications in biological processes like cell cycle or apoptosis . Our data support that, in spite of p38 MAPK activation by IR, its inhibition does not modify the response in any of the cell lines tested, or if so, it promotes an increase in radiosensitivity. N-[3-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1-(4-methylphenyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl]-N\u2032-[4-[2-(4-morpholinyl)ethoxy]-1-naphthalenyl]-urea (BIRB796, also known as Doramapimod) was purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) 5-Fluorouracil was obtained from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri, USA). Culture medium was replaced 24h after IR and refreshed every 2days until the end of the experiment (6days). SB203580 (10\u03bcM) or 5-FU (0.125\u03bcM) pretreatment was added, when indicated, 30min before IR and, 24h later, culture media were replaced by fresh media without SB203580 or 5-FU. To establish a role for p38 MAPK in the response to IR we decided to analyze several colorectal cancer derived cell lines (HT29, HCT116, RKO and HCT15) with different genetic backgrounds (vg. Then, dose\u2013response assays to IR were performed ( A) showing a radioresistant cell line (HT29) and various radiosensitive cell lines (HCT15, HCT116, and RKO). Therefore, we decided to focus onto HT29 and HCT116 cells as a model of radioresistant and radiosensitive cell lines respectively ( <0.001 at all doses, A), in which we evaluated time-course activation of p38 MAPK indicating that the time frame used for the p38 MAPK inhibitor was adequate with almost null p38 MAPK activation by IR at latter time points (D). In addition, BIRB796, specifically able to inhibit all four isoforms of p38 MAPK , was tested in HT29 and HCT116 cells, showing the same result as with SB203580 compound (). Selected pools showing reduced expression of p38 MAPK \u03b1, confirmed at RNA and protein level (B), were challenged against IR by dose response assay (C). H1299 cells, with a low p38 MAPK activation, were more radioresistant than H460 ( A and B), but again no effect was detected in both cell lines by the use of SB203580 or BIRB796 (A and B and ). While no effect of pretreatment with this drug was observed in HT29 cells ( A), a marked radiosensitizing effect was obtained in HCT116 model (B), except at 6Gy where the toxicity of IR alone is extremely high in this cell line. First, activation of p38 MAPK by IR seems to be clearly detected in several experimental models in cell culture in agreement with previous reports . Supporting our observation, it has been reported that c-Src could be implicated in the final activation of AKT through p38 MAPK, and its inhibition renders a slight increase in the apoptotic response to IR . Therefore, we could consider that p38 MAPK is implicated in the biological phase associated to IR exposure that includes latter effects such as apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, which can be triggered by several types of genotoxic agents. Indeed, this possibility suggests that activation of p38 MAPK could be a general response to DNA damage rather than a specific response to IR itself (see below). In this regard, it has been recently shown how SB203580 did not modify viability of mice in response to whole-body irradiation; however, the same compound in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was able to mitigate bone marrow suppression associated to IR, promoting an increase in the survival rate . While our data indicate that p38 MAPK seems to have a marginal role in response to IR or, if so, a citoprotective effect, JNK activation could be a critical step in the induction of apoptosis associated to IR . In fact, it has been recently reported a decline in p38 MAPK level in serum of HNSCC patients during IR and post IR periods, suggesting, at least in serum level, that a lower activity for the pathway should be obtained . Thus, we can speculate with the possibility that activation of p38 MAPK could be a consequence mediated by, for example, a decompensated RedOx state of the cell by ROS associated to IR rather than a specific response of the cells to IR itself, while in the case of CDDP the activation is even mediated by non-toxic compound containing platinum . In addition the use of BIRB796, able to inhibit all the p38MAPK members , discards the potential role of other p38 MAPKs, at least in our experimental models of HCT116, H460, H1299 and HT29 cells.", "Although radiation biomarkers have been reported in urine and serum, they are not informative about IR mediated tissue or organ specific injury. In the present study we report IR induced metabolic changes in gastrointestinal (GI) tissue of CD2F1 mice using ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Post-radiation GI injury is a critical determinant of survival after exposure to IR. Alternate methods including assessment of DNA damage and repair Biomarkers that can help identify exposed individuals are critically important in the event of mass casualty incidents The primary goal of the study therefore, was to identify metabolite markers of GI tissue injury in response to two sub-lethal IR doses of 4 and 8 Gy at 1 and 4 days post-IR exposure using a murine model. Future follow up studies with bio-fluids will augment the development of minimally invasive assays for evaluation of IR mediated tissue specific injury. Jejunum (two 5 cm sections) were harvested on day 1 and day 4 from animals exposed to 4 and 8 Gy of IR and from the sham treated groups (0 Gy) and cleaned by flushing with PBS. The Gene Expression Dynamic Inspector (GEDI) uses Self-organizing Maps (SOMs) to reduce data dimensionality with respect to gene number and to create characteristic visual representations for each sample We performed metabolomic profiling of GI tissue obtained from sham treated mice or those exposed to 4 or 8 Gy of IR, with six mice per treatment group. A total of 6421 (4 Gy) and 6478 (8 Gy) features were used for multivariate analyses ( The highlighted features exhibited high correlation values and were selected for further characterization ( A similar analysis was performed to compare the metabolomic profiles of sham treated mice with those that were exposed to 8 Gy of IR and Tryptophan was found to be up regulated in GI tissue, 1 day after IR exposure in a dose dependent manner. Dysregulation of tryptophan metabolism has been reported to result in gastrointestinal malfunction as well as the disruption of serotonin and kynurenine pathways Additionally, we found a significant dysregulation of lipid panel after IR exposure which is consistent with previous reports In order to characterize delayed GI tissue injury response, we selected 4 days as a post-IR exposure time point. Data pre-processing by XCMS resulted in the detection of 3851 & 3333 features for metabolomics profiling and 1697 & 815 for lipidomic profiling respectively in the positive mode ( The endogenous levels of metabolites spermidine, eicosenoic acid, PI (18:2/16:0) and taurocholic acid were found to be elevated in response to 4 Gy and 8 Gy IR exposures. The levels of UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, PE (18:2/0:0), PE (0\u201320:0/20:5) on the other hand were depleted post-IR exposure. The results depict clusters of metabolites that exhibit differential response in a dose and time dependent manner ( The Comparative canonical pathway analysis associated with GI tissue injury using murine model at different times and doses of IR exposure included arachidonic acid metabolism, eicosanoid signaling, and oxidative phosphorylation after 1 day of IR exposure. Malfunction in arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism has been reported in rat platelets after 24 h whole body radiation Exposure to IR is associated with induction of acute radiation syndrome (ARS) which can include depletion of bone marrow, internal bleeding, massive fluid and electrolyte loss from the GI tract and death. The mice were euthanized 1 day, post-IR exposure for blood and organ collection. Mean normalized ion abundance for each metabolite is plotted for groups of CD2F1 mice that were exposed to sham, 4 Gy or 8 Gy of IR at days 1 and 4. Statistically significant features detected for different IR doses and time points. The features that were significantly altered in the irradiated GI tissue after 4 days of IR exposure are listed.", "Inhibition or downregulation of PKC in primary human fibroblasts caused IR-dependent downregulation of the identified prosurvival (CREB phosphorylation) and antiapoptotic (Bad phosphorylation, Bcl-2) markers and thus lead to a proliferation stop and to apoptosis. Taken together, our analysis suggests that cytoplasmic PKC signaling conditions IR-stressed MRC-5 and IMR-90 cells to prevent irradiation-induced apoptosis. These findings contribute to the understanding of the cellular and nuclear IR response and may thus eventually improve the efficacy of radiotherapy and help overcome tumor radioresistance. Depending on the cell type, IR induces different responses and proteome changes. MRC-5 primary human lung fibroblasts were used in this study as a model cell strain, because these cells tolerate IR doses up to 80 Gy and do not induce apoptosis. Both doses induced key components of the classical DDR, including phosphorylation of ATM at serine 1981 (pS1981), of Chk1 at serine 345 (pS345), of H2A.X at serine 139 (pS139) and stabilization of p53 protein levels ( The strong reduction in colony formation of single cells after 10 days and the appearance of These results documented the suitability of 10 and 40 Gy IR to induce non-lethal, but senescence responses in primary fibroblasts. To quantify the kinetic proteome changes upon IR, MRC-5 fibroblasts were harvested at the 0.5, 2, 4 and 8 h time points after IR exposure (10 and 40 Gy) and RPPA analysis was performed ( The analysis described here identified distinct clusters based on the temporal up- and downregulation of specific proteins or protein modifications. In general, treatment of MRC-5 fibroblasts with 40 Gy induced more distinct clusters as compared with 10 Gy irradiation and three broad groups were apparent ( The detection of many classical DDR proteome changes upon both 10 and 40 Gy IR validated the RPPA analysis of IR-treated MRC-5 fibroblasts. The changes in PKC family members included the phosphorylation of the novel PKC- To elucidate whether PKC or other main signaling cascades regulate cell viability in NHFs upon IR treatment, a radiosensitivity screen with inhibitors specific for key components of the MEK-ERK, p38, JNK or PKC pathways was performed ( To confirm and validate PKC activation upon IR, western blot analyses were performed. In agreement with the RPPA results and the inhibitor studies, phosphorylation of PKC Although primary human fibroblasts are known to undergo senescence as a response to irradiation, the reduced phosphorylation of CREB and Bad, as well as the reduced cell viability, upon IR treatment and PKC inhibition or downregulation indicated the induction of apoptosis. In summary, these results demonstrated the IR-dependent activation of cytoplasmic PKC signaling and discovered the consecutive PKC-dependent activation of prosurvival signaling mediated via CREB and Bcl-2 as well as the inactivation of proapoptotic pathways (Bad), which direct normal human MRC-5 and IMR-90 fibroblasts towards senescence and prevent IR-induced apoptosis ( Human primary fibroblasts such as MRC-5 cells are able to repair DNA damage induced by IR doses up to 80 Gy. The network analysis of IR-induced proteome changes in MRC-5 fibroblasts presented here identified upregulation of known DDR factors (H2AX, p53, p21, MKK3/6, p38, MK2, Hsp27, Chk2) only 2\u20138 h after irradiation ( Most proteome changes, in particular upon 40 Gy IR, affected mitogenic signaling events controlling cell survival (MKK3/6-p38-MK2 pathway, MEK-ERK pathway, LKB-AMPK pathway, PKC-Bad pathway). The most important finding of this systematic RPPA analysis is the identification of PKC as a key player that orchestrates the downstream signaling pathways regulating apoptosis and cell survival ( This result has not only important implications for our understanding of the IR response but also for the comprehension of nuclear regulatory events and supports the concept of the cellular, in contrast to the nuclear, radiation response. This RPPA network analysis of IR-induced signaling identified a new, cytoplasmic, PKC-dependent regulatory mechanism that conditions stressed cells by preventing apoptosis. The PKC-dependent induction of prosurvival signaling and evasion of apoptosis is thus a mechanism, which renders primary human fibroblasts resistant to high doses of IR, and may thereby protect the microenvironment and permit survival of tumors. To identify significant proteome changes in response to IR, relative fluorescence intensities were imported to MeV version 4.6. Gene pathway membership data were obtained from protein interaction database, PID Significant proteome changes, identified by statistical (ANOVA) and fold-change analysis (log 2 cutoff) were subjected to protein\u2013protein interaction analysis using STRING (v. 9.0, For western blot analysis, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and bands were visualized by using either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1 : 5000; GE Healthcare, Life Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden) and ECL detection (GE Healthcare) or IR-dye-conjugated antibodies (1 : 15 000; LI-COR Biosciences) and detection by the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA).

( Pathway and protein\u2013protein interaction analysis of significant IR-induced proteome changes. Phosphorylation of PKC Model of PKC-dependent cellular prosurvival signaling in response to IR. IR-induced PKC signaling orchestrates cell survival via upregulation of Bcl-2 and phosphorylation of Bad and CREB. Hypersensitization with PKC inhibitors (GF109203X, Ro-318220) and genetic knock down (siPKC pan) leads to IR-induced activation of apoptosis mediated by p53 stabilization, upregulation of Bad and ARTD1 cleavage, as well as reduced senescence mediated via decrease in p21 protein levels and reduced", "To determine if proximal airway epithelium was properly differentiated, we examined levels of Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Next, we sought to utilise an To assess whether loss of Ssb1 affects CSR, we generated B cell specific conditional Given the perinatal lethality we observed in constitutive Monitoring of (A) Representative image of testes from Rosa26-CreER Histological examination of testes from 3-month-old To further characterize the consequences of Ssb1 ablation on fertility, we interbred induced To assess if conditional deletion of (A) Schematic diagram of the radiation challenge assay in Further, we performed complete blood count (CBC) analysis on peripheral blood of these mice to assess hematologic radiation toxicity, but no significant difference between the groups was observed ( To assess whether Ssb1 deficiency affects radiosensitivity in other tissues, we also isolated and exposed thymocytes to various doses of IR (1\u20136 Gy). We observed increased radiosensitivity in To further investigate the increased radiation sensitivity of conditional Five weeks after tamoxifen induction, nine-week-old To assess whether conditional (A) Long time survival cohort of Previous studies using siRNA depletion in human cells have reported a role for SSB1 in the proper co-ordination of DNA repair in response to IR Major unexpected findings include novel roles of Ssb1 in the regulation of lung and skeletal development, as constitutive germline ablation of Skeletal patterning is a complex process, and involves the spatial and temporal co-ordination of a number of developmental signalling pathways, including Hedgehog (in particular Indian Hedgehog [Ihh] and Sonic Hedgehog [Shh]), Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) and the Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-\u03b2) family, Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) and Wnt signalling Interestingly, the rib-cage phenotype we observe in Bone development can occur through two major processes, endochondral ossification, where a cartilage precursor template is laid down prior to bone formation, or intramembranous ossification, where mesenchymal cells condense and directly transition to form bone While the development defects in germline Aside from meiotic chromosome rearrangement, physiological programmed DSBs are also generated during Class Switch Recombination (CSR) in mature antigen-stimulated B lymphocytes A major role of DDR proteins, particularly crucial HR proteins, in mammalian cells is to maintain genomic integrity In conclusion, our results highlight a novel, and non-redundant role of Ssb1 in embryonic development, which may be due to a function independent of its previously described role in DNA repair.", "The percentage of proliferating cells was calculated as the ratio of Ki67-IR nuclei to DAPI-labeled nuclei multiplied by 100. Primary wildtype C57BL/6 astrocytes showed very low numbers of Ki67-IR nuclei (data not shown). In order to determine whether the expression of Akt, c-Myc or both oncogenes in primary p53 Control cultures (p53Crtl) showed no stem cell marker expression (A I\u2013A IV) and strong GFAP-IR (A V).

IR changes cellular metabolism, leading to EMT and CSC phenotypes.", "A total of 10 h later cells were mock treated or exposed to IR or medium containing HU, Mitomycin C or olaparib (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were transfected with siRNAs and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then plated onto coverslips and incubated for a further 24\u201348 h (depending on the post-treatment time point required) before treatment with 2Gy IR using an XRAD 225 X-ray generator (Precision X-ray Inc. Branford, CT, USA) at a dose rate of 0.591 Gy.min-1. Cells were fixed at 0, 1 and 24 h post-IR in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS followed by blocking in 3% BSA/PBS. As expected, dual knockdown of both splicing factors led to exacerbated sensitivity of cells to IR and HU treatment compared to depletion of either protein alone (Figure The cellular response to DNA damage is controlled by two main kinase signaling cascades, the ATM-Chk2 and ATR-Chk1 pathways, which are activated by double- and single-strand breaks respectively, thus leading to the regulation/activation of multiple cellular processes including DNA repair, apoptosis, transcription, cell cycle checkpoint activation and RNA processing.", "Quantification of pCaMKII-T286 IR was conducted at 10\u00d7 magnification using a light microscope (Olympus CX41, Olympus, Tokyo) connected to a computer with Bioquant Image Anaysis software (Bioquant Life Science Software v.8.40.20; Bioquant Corp, Nashville, TN). Mice in the reinstatement group emitted significantly more responses on the active lever, which produced cues (light and pump sound), as compared to the group that continued extinction, t(12) = 2.4, p = 0.03 ( Response-contingent cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior was associated with increased pCaMKII-T286 IR in specific corticolimbic nuclei: nucleus accumbens (AcbSh), cortex (anterior PIR), lateral septum, amygdala (LA and BLA), and mediodorsal thalamus. No changes were observed in other nuclei that showed prominent pCaMKII-T286 IR including central amygdala, dorsal striatum (medial and lateral), paraventricular thalamus, lateral habenula, and hypothalamus (dorsomedial and ventromedial) ( Cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior produced sub-regional effects on CaMKII-T286 phosphorylation in the nucleus accumbens. There was no change in MEAN \u00b1 SEM pCaMKII-T286 cells/mm No changes in were observed in MEAN \u00b1 SEM pCaMKII-T286 cells/mm Analysis of septal nuclei following cue-induced reinstatement identified a 1.46 fold increase in pCaMKII-T286 IR specifically in the lateral septum, t(7) = 2.13, p < 0.05 ( Analysis of the anterior piriform cortex, lateral to the nucleus accumbens, showed that reinstatement was associated with a significant increase in pCaMKII-T286 IR [t(8) = 1.99, p < 0.05] ( No changes were observed in in pCaMKII-T286 IR in the cingulate cortex subregions CG1, t(10) = 0.26, p = 0.80, or CG2, t(10) = 0.65, p = 0.53 ( Cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior was associated with a significant increase in CaMKII-T286 phosphorylation (i.e., activation) specifically in the lateral nuclei of the amygdala ( Cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior was associated with a site-specific increase in pCaMKII-T286 IR in the mediodorsal thalamus [t(8) = 1.9, p = 0.04] ( There were no changes in pCaMKII-T286 in the ventromedial or ventrolateral hypothalamus associated with cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior ( Addiction can be conceptualized as a disorder of neuroplasticity ( This premise is supported by growing evidence indicating that alcohol alters CaMKII expression and phosphorylation in brain regions that regulate the reinforcing effects of alcohol, such as the cortex, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala. Alcohol transiently increases CaMKII activity in mouse oocytes ( A key finding from this study is that cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior was associated with increased CaMKII-T286 IR in the nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh), with no effect in the accumbens core (AcbC) or dorsal striatum (medial or lateral). The nucleus accumbens is a major component of the mesolimbic reward pathway and a primary site of alcohol\u2019s positive reinforcing effects ( Sub-regional specificity was also observed in the amygdala where cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior was accompanied by a significant increase in pCamKII-T286 IR in the lateral and basolateral amygdala, but not in the central nucleus. The piriform is part of the olfactory cortex and plays a critical role in odor memory ( Results from this study also show that cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior is associated with increased CaMKII-T286 IR in the lateral septum (dorsal, intermediate, and ventral sub-nuclei combined) with no change in the medial septum. The lateral septum regulates neural and behavioral aspects of motivation and addiction ( pCaMKII-T286 IR was observed in a variety of thalamic nuclei ( Although this study shows an association between CaMKII-T286 activation and cue-induced reinstatement, it is important to consider several methodological caveats when interpreting the data.

We also found a positive correlation between VDR expression and the biochemical parameters associated with IR. It is conventional wisdom that 1,25(OH) It has been demonstrated that the intracellular concentrations of 1,25(OH) Interestingly, it has been described that VD decreases the chronic pro-inflamamtory status of adipose tissue by down-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokine production in a process in which NF-\u03baB and VDR is involved [ Metabolic interaction has been reported between the VD and IGF-1 axes experimentally, with evidence to show that IGF-1 exerts some effects through changes in VD activation while 1,25(OH) Our results showing higher expression of IGFBP-3, but not IGFBP-1, in VAT from the MO subjects are in accordance with other animal and in vitro studies [ In summary, our results indicate that serum levels of 25-OH-VD in MO subjects play a key role in the expression of VDR associated with IR. The regulation of IGFBP-3 by VDR activation may be one of the local and competitive mechanisms used by adipocytes to limit further fat gain and IR. HOMA-IR was calculated with the following equation: HOMA-IR = fasting insulin (\u00b5IU/mL) \u00d7 fasting glucose (mmol/L)/22.5. Combined gel shift and supershift experiments were performed with equal amounts of nuclear extracts of VAT from control (lanes 1, 4, and 7), LIR-OM (lanes 2, 5, and 8) and HIR-OM (lanes 3, 6, and 8) to show the ability of VDR to bind to the Significance of visceral adipose tissue IGFBP protein levels in control, LIR-MO and HIR-MO groups. xMAP assay of protein levels (columns in the \u201c NF-\u03baB activation in non-obese, LIR-MO, and HIR-MO.

Compared with the non-target-siRNA-transfected cells, knockdown of the endogenous Akt1 or Akt3 ( Residual DNA DSBs are the major cause of cell death and clonogenic inactivation induced by IR. Thus, we investigated whether knockdown of Akt isoforms differentially affects clonogenic activity alone as well as in combination with IR. The cells were lysed with lysis buffer An analysis of the \u03b3H2AX foci was used to evaluate the repair of the IR-induced DSBs following siRNA-mediated knockdown of the Akt isoforms. ( Akt1 and Akt3 but not Akt2 stimulate repair of IR-induced DSBs.", "Here we investigated whether EPO could reduce IR in type 2 diabetic mouse skeletal muscle and its possible signaling mechanisms of action. IR occurs most commonly within peripheral adipocytes and skeletal muscle Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein produced during fetal development within kidney and liver tissue, and has been widely used in the clinic to treat anemia induced by chronic kidney disease, tumors and other diseases. To test whether rhEPO could improve mouse glucose intolerance, Insulin has the ability to stimulate the production of nitric oxide (NO) which is important for insulin-stimulated glucose disposal As shown in Figure We further evaluated phosphorylated Akt, PI3K, IRS-1 and eNOS levels in total protein fractions of skeletal muscle tissue from These results suggest that IRS-1/AKT/PI3K signal pathways were activated by rhEPO treatment and rhEPO could promote NO products and increased eNOS activity in skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetic mice. To further determine whether rhEPO protects skeletal muscle against hyperglycemia via its specific EPO receptor, we isolated and cultured primary skeletal muscle cells from 12-week-old To clarify whether rhEPO activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is involved in EPO/EPOR signal transduction in skeletal muscle cells, we examined phosphorylated IRS-1 Suppression of EPOR resulted in a reduction in 2-DG uptake under insulin-stimulated conditions in skeletal muscle cell. Our findings indicate that EPO improvement of skeletal muscle insulin resistance may occur through induction of autophagy as a potential mechanism, as similar results were observed in dihydromyricetin Together, our results from the present study provide supporting evidence that EPO-EPOR interaction is an essential process for the induction of glucose uptake, and the possible mechanisms of its beneficial actions involve activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3K, AKT, IRS-1, and enhanced autophagy and reduced apoptosis in type 2 diabetic skeletal muscle. In summary, these findings shed light on possible new strategies for therapy of IR in diabetes and chronic kidney disease.", "In other words, adding as little as 1% of 51B cells to 51A cells in the inoculum significantly shortened the survival time of mice ( To determine the differential growth speed of each cell subpopulation The above characterization of GBM subcultures with Similar studies were then conducted to determine the impact of acute (2 Gy) or chronic (10 \u00d7 0.5 Gy or 10 \u00d7 1.0 Gy) IR on cellular bioenergetics 7 or 11 days following exposure, respectively. Following IR, glycolytic respiration and oxidative phosphorylation levels remained higher and lower, respectively, in 51A compared to 51B (Figure The difference in cellular bioenergetics of 51A, with a higher glycolytic respiration and lower oxidative phosphorylation compared to 51B, and the versatility in switching between two respiration systems upon radiation, suggested that 51A was more radio-resistant. Since 51B cells cannot form a colony either under adherent conditions or in soft agar, we determined the relative radiosensitivity of 51A and 51B by measurements of cell proliferation conducted 1 week after two weekly exposures (5 Gy each), and comparing to corresponding cells (seeded in half amount) without IR. The blue-stained cells were considered to be inviable cells from IR as they lacked the ability to exclude Trypan Blue dye, and were excluded in cell counting. In our previous study of radiation effects on glioma cells, we found that the extracellular level of MMP2 was upregulated by radiation [ We compared the redox status of cells in response to IR. As shown in Figure A fractionated IR was performed using 51A (3 or 5 x10 A repeat of the IR experiment was performed using 51A with lower seeding density (8 or 12 \u00d7 10 The data above showed the differential radiation-resistance and molecular profiles of two subpopulations with and without DM, and that the surviving cells with DM frequently mis-segregated their DM chromosomes to re-populate the population subset of cells lacking DM (see study on 51AS7 in Figure We cultured cells from 51A and 51B after chronic radiation in basal medium for 1 and 2 days and used conditioned medium (CM) to culture un-irradiated cells of both types, adding the supplements required by NS and SA-lines (EGF/bFGF/B27 for 51A and 10% fetal bovine serum for 51B) for five days, followed by cell invasion assays and quantification of genes which expressions were regulated by radiation.

Immunoblotting of CM-P with antibody against ANGTP1 failed to detect ANGTP1, as shown of WCL, while SPARC antibody detected SPARC made by 51B cells, which were not altered by IR (Figure Nearly 40% of GBM tumors demonstrate Radiation-induced oxidative stress has been shown to alter cell survival parameters through metabolic disruptions that alter the redox state and basal homeostasis of cells. Different alterations on redox status were seen in glioma cells without DM in 51B in which ROS level was stable after acute IR.", "The pJNK/JNK ratio was quantified by Western blotting analysis in the LV of mice with or without MLC901 during myocardial IR Cardioprotection is associated with the activation of pro-survival MAPKs. Ratios of pERK1/2/ERK1/2 and pAkt/AKT were evaluated in the LV of mice subjected to IR with or without MLC901 treatment. Phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and AKT was significantly increased in MLC901-treated LV compared to IR (**p = 0.005 and **p = 0.002, respectively; Fig. Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury affects not only the cardiomyocyte compartment but also all other cellular compartments, and the coronary circulation has a central role in it Improved coronary flow in MLC901 treated hearts subjected to IR Since it was previously observed that MLC901 treatment was associated with a pro-angiogenic protective effect after stroke Increased vascular density in the ischemic area in 4 month-MLC901 treated hearts. A 45%-decrease was observed in mice treated by MLC901 compared to non-treated IR. These data are supported also by the significant increase in the vessel density evaluated after a 4-month treatment in the infarcted area in MLC901 treated compared to non-treated IR hearts, suggesting that MLC901 is able to induce a vascular remodelling and repair as already reported after ischemic stroke in a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion EF was measured from the bidimensional mode (B-mode) after evaluation of the systolo-diastolic cavity volumes and from the area-length method In our study, the reduction in cardiac injury with MLC901 was paralleled with an improvement in LV systolic performance. MLC901-treated mice showed higher LV ejection fraction (LVEF) from 1 month to 4 months after MI compared to non-treated IR mice. This positive effect is associated with a trend in the improvement of survival rates in the group of mice treated by MLC901 compared to the non-treated IR during the 4 following months. It predicts clinical outcomes better than LVEF in patients with previous MI Measurements of conventional parameters for the study of systolic function (ejection fraction, STI-derived ejection fraction) and also advanced speckle-tracking based strain measures of cardiac performance, in particular global longitudinal strain show that global left ventricular function was improved in the group of mice treated by MLC901 compared to the non-treated IR group. Various protocols were applied: IR: 40 minutes ischemia\u201360 minutes reperfusion; IR IR SHAM: sham operation without coronary artery ligation (surgery placebo). To do this, hearts were mounted on a Langendorff apparatus and subjected to 1-hour global ischemia followed by 1-hour reperfusion (IR group).", "The most toxic form of DNA damage caused by IR is DNA DSBs. On the third day, cells were exposed to IR at a dose of 0.5, 1, or 1.5 Gy or not exposed to IR. Cells without \u03b2-Thujaplicin and cells treated with IR for 48 h were served as negative and positive control respectively. We treated cells with \u03b2-thujaplicin and induced DSBs by exposure to IR. We used colony formation assay to determine whether \u03b2-thujaplicin reduced the survival of U2OS osteosarcoma cells after IR. To identify an optimal combination of \u03b2-thujaplicin concentration and IR doses, we treated cells with \u03b2-thujaplicin at a range of concentrations (0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 \u03bcM) in combination with IR at a range of doses (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 Gy). When \u03b2-thujaplicin was combined with IR treatment at different drug concentrations and IR doses, colony formation decreased significantly as the drug concentration and IR dose increased ( Next we tested the combination treatment using \u03b2-thujaplicin and PARP inhibitor BMN673 on cell proliferation. In addition, we found that \u03b2-thujaplicin can radiosensitize osteosarcoma U2OS cells, a cancer cell type normally insensitive to IR. A.

These DA neurons, comprising 1\u20132 neurons of the PPL1 cluster, function in conveying an aversive stimulus when stimulated (Masek et al., We also found enhanced 5-HT IR in DA-deficient brains in the terminal regions of the PPL1 neurons, in the MB \u03b1-lobe. These changes may possibly be explained by 5-HT being now expressed or taken up more strongly in these PPL1 neurons or, as observed in vertebrate models for PD, where denervation of DA neurons was found to potentiate 5-HT IR at neuronal terminals (Zhou et al., DA deficiency has consequences on a broad variety of behaviors in DA neuron denervation strongly alters 5-HT neuron innervation in the rat striatum (Rylander et al., However, our data show decreases in 5-HT levels in terminal regions and altered 5-HT neuron plasticity in wild type brains with enhanced DA subsequent to L-DOPA treatment. The Supplementary Material for this article can be found online at: DA-deficient flies show increased 5-HT IR in neurons of the posterior lateral protocerebrum.", "The most recent findings suggest that p53 directly activates sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), which in turn facilitates export of FoxO1 (forkhead box protein O1) to the cytoplasm [124]. Besides direct regulation of metabolic enzymes, hypothalamic SIRT1/p53 pathway was implicated in the response towards ghrelin, the hormone regulating food intake [153]. High-glucose incubation of endothelial cells evoked the reduction of SIRT1 in concert with higher acetylation and activation of p53, which provoked the senescence and dysfunction of endothelial cells [183]. Other findings connected NAFLD pathology with the p53/miRNA34a pathway, known to repress SIRT1 (sirtuin1) expression [195]. Binding of IRS proteins and their phosphorylation precedes recruitment of PI3K, as well as subsequent PIP2 phosphorylation.", "This study was designed to investigate possible protective effects of sevoflurane on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) and its impact on expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and caspase-3 in rats, so as to provide new insights for the treatment of MIRI. Perfusion was performed using Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) refers to the damage to the myocardium caused by both the ischemia and the restoration of blood flow into the previously ischemic tissue. After reperfusion, the myocardial ultrastructure, function, metabolism and electrophysiological characteristics are further damaged, worsening the patients' condition ( Studies have shown that inhalation a certain amounts of anesthetics before ischemia or at the beginning of reperfusion can inhibit MIRI, and protect the myocardium ( The hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) can induce the expression of a series of downstream target genes under hypoxic conditions such as necrosis, ischemia and injury, and these downstream genes, which are involved in angiogenesis, sugar and iron metabolism and cell proliferation, play important roles in apoptosis ( In addition, HIF-1\u03b1 plays a key regulatory role in the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease and can inhibit MIS expansion to improve myocardial function ( Forty SPF grade male SD rats (weighing 250\u2013300 g) were purchased from Shanghai Experimental Animal Center of the Chinese Academy of Science (Shanghai, China). As shown in Inhalation of a certain dose of sevoflurane before myocardial ischemia or during the early stages of reperfusion has been shown to be able to protect the myocardium by inhibiting myocardial abnormalities during reperfusion through the activation of specific signaling pathways, and this myocardial protection is similar to that of ischemic preconditioning ( Apoptosis, which is regulated by anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 and apoptotic hydrolase caspase-3 through a series of complex processes, is an important molecular mechanism in the process of MIRI cell death and plays an important role in IR injury and prognosis ( In order to investigate the effects of sevoflurane on HIF-1\u03b1 expression and cell apoptosis, expression levels of HIF-1\u03b1, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 were quantitatively analyzed. It is known that activation of HIF-1\u03b1 can induce the expression of downstream genes involved in cytoprotection, so as to inhibit cell apoptosis and reduce myocardial injury caused by IR ( In conclusion, our study confirmed that sevoflurane (1MAC) treatment can improve the function parameters of hearts undergoing IR and reduces MIS. Our findings provide new insights for the diagnosis and treatment of MIRI. Effect of sevoflurane treatment on hemodynamic parameters of IR treated hearts.", "Deficiency of autophagy protein ATG16L1 is associated with increases in inflammatory diseases and lipid metabolism, but the connection between ATG16L1, IR, and obesity remains elusive. We hypothesize that myeloid ATG16L1 contributes to lipid loading in macrophages and to IR. ATG16L1 does not contribute to obesity, IR, adipose tissue inflammation or lipid loading in macrophages in mice fed HFD.", "According to this definition, the most important criterion is the presence of a glucose metabolism disorder with serum glucose levels (BG) \u22656.1 mmol/L or insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) model and/or insulin resistance and at least two other criteria: BMI \u226530 kg/m Patient with severe liver steathosis and metabolic syndrome Criteria for METS according to IDF (2005) Non-Alcoholic steatosis or Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is a metabolic disease caused by fat tissue dysfunction.", "IR and non-irradiated (NI) specimens were evaluated for flexural strength (\u03c3, n=30) followed by fractography (SEM), diametral tensile strength (DTS, n=30), hardness (H, n=10), surface roughness (R a , n=10) and chemical composition (n=3). The IR effect on each material property was statistically analyzed using Student's t test (\u03b1=0.05). IR significantly increased the mean \u03c3 values of VIT and KME and the mean DTS value of VIT (p<0.05). IR increased R a and H values for VIT and decreased H value for Z-250 (p<0.05). The remaining materials and properties were not significantly affected by IR (p>0.05). There was no significant change on materials composition after IR.", "Fasting levels of glucose, insulin, glycohemoglobin and selected IR-related and tumor-derived markers were measured. Analysis of 77 BCa-bearing patients and 71 controls showed an association between BCa and IR as demonstrated by impaired glucose/insulin homeostasis (increased fasting- and OGTT-induced glucose levels) and deteriorated IR indexes, which was especially patent in premenopausal women. The association between BCa presence and IR was markedly influenced by BMI, being obese BCa patients significantly more insulin resistant than controls. BCa presence was associated to elevated levels of IR (glucose, triglycerides) and tumor-derived (VEGF) markers, especially in overweight/obese patients. BCa presence is associated to IR in overweight/obese premenopausal but not in premenopausal normal weight or postmenopausal women. Our data support a bidirectional relationship between dysregulated/imbalanced glucose/insulin metabolism and BCa, as tumor- and IR-markers are correlated with the impairment of glucose/insulin metabolism in overweight/obese premenopausal BCa patients. Breast cancer (BCa) is the most frequent and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in female population [ Accordingly, in an attempt to unequivocally elucidate the association between BCa and glucose/insulin metabolism, by more accurately assessing IR, and by appropriately stratifying the patients by BMI and menopausal state, we have implemented a prospective study including 148 women with suspect of non-familial, sporadic BCa in whom we measured glucose, insulin, glycohemoglobin, and other IR-related and tumor-derived markers, as well as glucose/insulin levels during the OGTT. Specifically, mounting evidence indicate that several obesity-associated factors such as insulin, leptin, adiponectin or triglycerides can contribute to the development and/or progression of several cancer types, including BCa [ In summary, our results indicate that BCa presence is associated to higher IR in overweight/obese premenopausal woman but not in premenopausal normal weight patients or in postmenopausal woman. Further, our findings suggest a bidirectional relationship between dysregulated glucose/insulin metabolism and BCa, as both, tumor- and IR-related markers are correlated with the severity of glucose/insulin metabolism impairment in overweight/obese premenopausal BCa patients. Between 2011 and 2015, women received in the Mammary Gland Unit at the HURS with suspect of non-familial, sporadic BCa, considered within a group of common risk, image-diagnosed within BIRADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) grade 4\u20135 and subjected to core-needle biopsy of the mammary gland were invited to participate in this study. At 30, 60, 90 and 120 min [ Fasting indexes were calculated using the formula: HOMA-IR = [fasting insulin (mU/L)*fasting glucose (mmol/L)]/22.5 and Fasting blood was used to determine glucose, insulin, glycohemoglobin, lipids (non-esterified fatty acids [NEFA (Wako Chemicals GmbH, Neuss, DE)], total cholesterol [TC], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL], high density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL] and triglycerides [TG]).", "Supernatants containing equal amounts of protein were incubated with anti-IRS-1 (10\u03bcg/ml), anti-IRS-2 (10\u03bcg/ml), or anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) (10\u03bcg/ml) and then incubated with 10\u03bcl protein A\u2013Sepharose 6MB. IRS-1, IRS-2, and tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated from aliquots of the supernatant containing 10mg protein with anti-IRS-1, anti-IRS-2, or 4G10 antibodies, respectively, followed by protein A\u2013Sepharose 6MB. Homogenates of these tissues were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS or anti-phosphotyrosine (\u03b1-PY) antibodies. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IR was represented by an approximately 90kDa band of the phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of the \u03b1-PY immunoprecipitated ( , upper panels). With in vivo insulin stimulation, the respective tyrosine phosphorylation levels of IR of acute- and chronic-alcohol-administered rats were shown to be significantly increased: 1.9- (<0.05) and 3.0- (<0.05) fold in muscle, 1.9- (<0.05) and 3.9- (<0.05) fold in the liver, and 5.1- (<0.05) and 4.6- (<0.05) fold in epididymal fat, as compared to control rats (, lower panel). The amounts of IRS-1 protein in the liver, muscle, and the epididymal fat of acute- and chronic-alcohol-fed rats were found to be very similar to those of control rats (, top panel). Basal tyrosine phosphorylation levels of IRS-1 in these three tissues were similar in control and alcohol-fed rats (, middle panel). However, in the insulin-stimulated state, the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of IRS-1 in acute- and chronic-alcohol-administered rats were increased as compared to that in control rats (, lower panel). IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in muscle was increased by 3.6- (<0.05) and 2.9- (<0.05) fold, that in the liver by 2.4- (<0.05) and 2.4- (<0.05) fold, and that in fat by 1.8- and 2.5- (<0.05) fold, respectively, in acute- and chronic-alcohol-administered rats as compared to control rats. The hepatic tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 was enhanced by 2.8- and 4.1-fold in acute- and chronic-alcohol-administered rats, respectively, as compared with the controls (, lower panel). The adipose tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 was enhanced by 1.7- and 1.8-fold in acute- and chronic-alcohol-administered rats. These results suggest insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IR, IRS-1, and IRS-2 (liver only) in skeletal muscle, liver, and fat to be enhanced by alcohol loading. We measured PI 3-kinase activity in the immunoprecipitates with the respective antibodies against IRS-1, IRS-2, and phosphotyrosine. Insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activities associated with IRS-1 in muscle, hepatic, and adipose tissues of the chronic-alcohol-administered rats were increased to 1.9-, 2.9- (<0.05), and 3.0- (<0.05) fold, respectively, as compared to those in control rats ( ). In case of the acute-alcohol-administered rats insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activities associated with IRS-1 in the livers and adipose tissues were significantly increased to 3.2- (<0.05) and 2.8- (<0.05) fold, respectively, compared to those in control rats (). IRS-2 associated insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activities were increased in adipose tissues of acute-alcohol-administered rats and were 2.3- (<0.05), 3.2- (<0.05), and 2.5- (<0.05) fold higher, respectively, in hepatic and adipose tissues of chronic-alcohol-administered rats (). These results suggest insulin-induced activations of PI 3-kinase associated with IRS-1, IRS-2, and phosphotyrosine to apparently be enhanced by either acute- or chronic-alcohol administration. In skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes, the rate-limiting step of glucose uptake is determined by translocation of the highly insulin-sensitive type glucose transporter GLUT4 to the cell surface, in which insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase activations via the insulin receptor and its substrates, IRS-1 and IRS-2, have been shown to play an important role. Thus, we investigated how the insulin-induced phosphorylation of IR, IRS-1, and IRS-2 and resultant activation of PI 3-kinase in muscle, hepatic, and adipose tissues were affected by ethanol feeding. When ethanol was acutely or continuously loaded, insulin-induced phosphorylations of IR, IRS-1, and IRS-2 were all significantly increased as compared to controls (). Similarly, PI 3-kinase activities immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1, anti-IRS-2, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies in the rats chronically fed ethanol were apparently increased as compared to those of control rats. This result is contrary to previous in vitro studies showing phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1 to be inhibited when cultured cells are exposed to ethanol . The molecular mechanism underlying the enhanced insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IR, IRS-1, and IRS-2 is unclear, but two possibilities may be considered. Thus, some compensatory mechanism(s) may exist to regulate the efficiency of the phosphorylation of IR and IRS-proteins.", "Here we provide evidence that transcriptional activation of the human IR promoter requires the assembly of a transcriptionally active multiprotein-DNA complex which includes, in addition to HMGI-Y, the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor Sp1 and the CCAAT-enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBP beta). Functional integrity of this nucleoprotein complex is required for full transactivation of the IR gene by Sp1 and C/EBP beta in cells readily expressing IRs. We show that HMGI-Y physically interacts with Sp1 and C/EBP beta and facilitates the binding of both factors to the IR promoter in vitro. Repression of HMGI-Y function adversely affects both Sp1- and C/EBP beta-induced transactivation of the IR promoter. Together, these findings demonstrate that HMGI-Y plays significant molecular roles in the transcriptional activities of these factors in the context of the IR gene and provide concordant support for the hypothesis that, in affected individuals, a putative defect in these nuclear proteins may cause decreased IR expression with subsequent impairment of insulin signaling and action.", "Co-presence (0.03%) of polyethyleneglycol- p-isooctylphenyl ether (Triton X-100, TX) with tau2, however, abolished this IR on GCIs, but did not abolish tau2 IR on neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). It indicates that the appearance of tau2 IR on GCIs is not related to hyperphosphorylation of tau. These tau2-immunoreactive bands, except those from bovine brain, were similarly abolished in the presence of TX (0.06%), and repeated washing after exposure to TX restored the tau2 IR on immunohistochemistry and on immunoblot.", "Additionally, it is not known whether DNA-damaging drugs commonly used in chemotherapy, which may activate different signal transduction pathways than UV or IR, also confer Cdc25A degradation.", "When HeLa cells were exposed to a nonlethal dose of IR, where cells are presumably able to repair damaged DNA, HDAC4 foci were efficiently resolved. Members of the SIR2 family of HDACs have been implicated in the DNA response in budding yeast, contributing either directly or indirectly to the repair of double-strand breaks ( In linking a HDAC with the DNA damage response to agents inducing double-strand breaks, the results presented here may also have clinical implications for treating patients with cancer.

IR-induced accelerated proteolysis of Cdc25A leads to inhibition of the Cdk2 kinase activity, which in turn prevents loading of the Cdc45 origin binding factor on chromatin . Chk2 directly interacts with and phosphorylates Cdc25A in an ATM- and IR-dependent manner . Although plausible, a role of Chk1 in the rapid IR-induced intra-S-phase responses has not been directly demonstrated, and, in general, the specific function(s) of mammalian Chk1 in DSB-activated checkpoints is unclear. After IR, the activated Chk2 coregulates a subset of these residues on Cdc25A. Furthermore, the IR-induced acute acceleration of Cdc25A proteolysis requires ongoing Chk1 activity, as well as ATM-mediated phosphorylations of Chk1. Our results provide mechanistic insights into how Chk1 and Chk2 cooperate to avoid potentially cancer-promoting consequences of unscheduled DNA replication in response to IR. First, addition of the Chk1 inhibitor UCN-01 for 1 hr to human U2-OS cells in the absence of IR caused increased Cdc25A protein level and activity ( , lane 2). In cells grown without any drug, the Cdc25A protein and activity rapidly declined after 10 Gy IR (, lane 3), yet this response was abrogated when UCN-01 was added immediately before (, lane 4) or after (Supplemental Figure S1 at ) irradiation. Analogous to UCN-01, treatment of nonirradiated U2-OS cells with CEP-3891 caused a detectable increase in Cdc25A protein level and activity (, lane 3), and addition of CEP-3891 immediately before IR (, lane 4) diminished the rapid IR-induced downregulation of Cdc25A. Consistent with the effects seen with both chemical inhibitors of Chk1, Cdc25A protein level and activity increased in siRNA-transfected, nonirradiated cells (, lane 5), and the IR-induced downregulation of Cdc25A was impaired (, lane 6). Thus, three independent tools of Chk1 inhibition lead to Cdc25A stabilization in unstressed cells and prevented its efficient degradation after IR. Collectively, these data suggest that Chk1 controls both the basal and the IR-induced accelerated turnover of Cdc25A. When 33P-ortho-phosphate was used to label the cells, IR exposure (15 Gy) did not lead to any major change of the phosphopeptide pattern, suggesting that IR does not induce de novo phosphorylations on Cdc25A (negative data not shown). We next tested phosphorylation-site mutants of Cdc25A for their ability to be downregulated in the absence or presence of IR. Consistent with our previous results , the turnover of wild-type Cdc25A was accelerated in cells exposed to IR ( , upper panel). This quadruple mutant was significantly more stable than the wild-type Cdc25A regardless of IR exposure in both cycloheximide (, lower panel) and 35S-methionine-based pulse-chase assays. We and others previously showed that mutation of serine 123 alone was sufficient to impair the IR-induced Cdc25A degradation . These experiments confirmed that S123 is indeed a prominent residue involved in regulating the Cdc25A protein turnover, as this was the only site that affected the Cdc25A half-life when mutated alone, and prevented the IR-induced degradation ( and data not shown). Western blotting with anti-pS123 on lysates from IR-exposed versus untreated cells showed that S123 was already phosphorylated in undamaged cells (data not shown). In contrast, after IR exposure, the kinetics of S123 phosphorylation were faster and Cdc25A shifted more rapidly to slower migrating forms. Importantly, the chemical inhibition of Chk1 or Chk2 resulted in a delay in the IR-induced S123 phosphorylation, and this effect was consistently augmented when both inhibitors were combined . These data indicate that after IR-induced DNA damage, both Chk1 and Chk2 participate in phosphorylating Cdc25A on a residue critical for its stability. Indeed, the genetic downregulation of either Chk1 or Chk2 also leads to a decrease of IR-induced phosphorylation of Cdc25A on S123 . Second, after IR exposure, the rate of phosphate incorporation into at least a subset of these residues increases due to a combination of the ongoing activities of Chk1- and IR-induced Chk2 that jointly promote the accelerated turnover of Cdc25A. Since inhibition of Chk1 abrogates IR-induced downregulation of Cdc25A, we asked whether inhibition of Chk1 would affect the S phase checkpoint and cause RDS. Indeed, addition of the Chk1 inhibitors UCN-01 or CEP-3891 prior to irradiation partly rescued the inhibition of DNA synthesis after IR ( , left panel). Consistently, HeLa cells transfected with Chk1 siRNA showed less inhibition of DNA synthesis in response to IR than cells treated with control siRNA (, middle panel). Treatment with Chk2-specific siRNA also caused RDS (, middle panel), consistent with the previously identified role of Chk2 in Cdc25A degradation after IR . This may indicate that in the absence of Chk1 (which would lead to stabilization of Cdc25A even without IR), Chk2 alone is insufficient to stimulate the S phase checkpoint. In any case, the siRNA data do support our conclusion that Chk1 is an integral component of the rapid IR-induced S phase checkpoint. No significant effects were seen on DNA synthesis after IR by addition of UCN-01 or CEP-3891 to AT fibroblasts (, right panel). Consistent with the RDS phenotype, Cdc25A is not degraded efficiently in AT cells after IR ( and ). These data indicate that while Chk1-mediated control over the basal turnover of Cdc25A is ATM-independent, the accelerated destruction of Cdc25A after IR may depend on a functional link between ATM and Chk1. The IR-induced effects on Chk1 are less clear. Using the available phosphospecific antibodies and different cell types, we observed that Chk1 was phosphorylated on S317 and S345 rapidly after IR in a dose-dependent manner ( and data not shown). To test whether IR-induced phosphorylation of Chk1 is ATM-dependent, we used AT cells transfected with control vector or stably reconstituted with ATM . Strikingly, the control AT cells showed impaired phosphorylation of Chk1 on S317 after IR, and reconstitution with ATM rescued the IR-induced phosphorylation on S317 and S345 (data not shown). Remarkably, while the wild-type Chk1 efficiently rescued the IR-induced accelerated turnover of Cdc25A in cells deprived of endogenous Chk1, the Chk1 allele where both S317 and S345 were substituted to alanines was reproducibly less efficient . Collectively, these data suggest that in addition to its role in maintaining the physiological turnover of Cdc25A, Chk1 actively contributes to a full-scale destruction of Cdc25A after exposure to IR, and that the latter (but not the former) Chk1 function operates in an ATM-dependent manner. We could demonstrate that Chk1 is required for IR-induced downregulation of Cdc25A and that ablation of Chk1 function leads to RDS. One way that Chk1 participates in the IR-induced S phase checkpoint may again relate to its role in controlling the basal turnover of Cdc25A. We propose that such Chk1-mediated basal control of Cdc25A turnover is a necessary prerequisite to accommodate any IR-induced signals to accelerate the proteolysis of Cdc25A. Such a scenario is consistent with our observation that IR exposure did not involve new phosphorylation sites, but rather increased the rate of phosphorylation on the same residue of Cdc25A that was already phosphorylated by Chk1 in nonirradiated cells (see ). Furthermore, we showed that exposure to IR induced ATM-dependent posttranslational modifications of Chk1, including phosphorylation of serines 317 and 345. Together with the ability of immunopurified ATM to phosphorylate Chk1 and the fact that mutation of serines 317 and 345 impaired the ability of Chk1 to promote the IR-induced degradation of Cdc25A, these results strongly suggest that regulation of the IR-induced S phase checkpoint relies on the direct ATM-Chk1 functional interplay. Translated specifically to the Chk1-Cdc25A interplay, IR-induced Chk1 modifications may help protect this vital cellular factor (in unstressed cells, Chk1 is an unstable protein ), or secure and/or enhance the ongoing access of Chk1 to Cdc25A by recruiting essential cofactor, such as the recently identified claspin . Our results provide direct mechanistic evidence that this indeed might be the case, since Chk1 is an essential ATM-regulated component of the IR-induced signaling to accelerate proteolysis of Cdc25A. On the other hand, in response to IR, the ATM-dependent phosphorylations of Chk1 are less pronounced compared to the entirely ATR-dependent checkpoint responses such as stalled replication forks and/or the UV-type of DNA damage (; and our unpublished data). Thus, while ATR-mediated checkpoint responses appear to depend solely on Chk1 to switch the Cdc25A proteolysis to the accelerated mode, the IR-induced DNA damage in somatic cells requires a cooperative action of other ATM-induced factors such as Chk2 , previously identified in our laboratory as one mediator of the timely Cdc25A degradation in response to IR . First, the selective siRNA downregulation of Chk1 and Chk2, respectively, impaired the IR-induced Cdc25A phosphorylation. The proposed cooperative action of ATM-activated Chk2 and ATM-modified Chk1 might be instrumental to rapidly reach and maintain the threshold of the IR-induced cell defense mechanism that would be sufficiently high to prevent unscheduled origin firing and other events potentially priming for acute genetic instability. Regarding the IR-induced S phase checkpoint, we propose that the ATM signaling to Cdc25A may not need to initiate damage-specific pathways, but rather modulate the kinetics of the existing, Chk1-controlled S phase processes. In such a model, ATM-downstream (and strictly damage-inducible) events including IR-induced modification of Chk1 itself (this study) and activation of Chk2 would act as modifiers, nonessential to support the imminent requirement for cell survival but important especially under conditions when cells encounter increasing demand to cope with stress and more vigorous replication activity. Active involvement of Chk1 in the intra-S-phase cell cycle response to IR-induced genotoxic stress, uncovered in this study, is consistent with candidacy of Chk1 for a tumor suppressor, a notion supported by mutations of Chk1 detected in diverse human malignancies .", "Suboptimal dose of IR and SNAP up-regulated the cell-surface Fas antigen, detected by FACScan using FITC-anti-Fas antibody. When combined with IR or SNAP, agonistic anti-Fas antibody CH-11 resulted in marked enhancement of apoptosis. During the IR and SNAP sensitized Fas-induced apoptosis, mitochondria permeabilization, cytochrome c release, and DNA fragmentation were detected. Furthermore, combined treatment of IR and SNAP additively up-regulated the surface Fas protein expression and sensitized Fas-induced apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate that sensitization of HeLa cervical cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis by IR and NO donor is most likely due to the up-regulation of Fas expression and also provides a means with which to sensitize tumors to the killing effects of cancer therapy via the Fas receptor.", "To clarify the basis for cell killing during prostate cancer radiotherapy, we determined the IR-induced expression of several apoptotic- (bax, bcl-2, survivin and PARP) and G1-cell cycle checkpoint- (p53 and p21(WAF1/Cip1)) related proteins, in both normal (PrEC-epithelial and PrSC-stromal) and malignant (LNCaP, DU-145 and PC-3; all epithelial) prostate cells. We observed that IR-induced bax and p21(WAF1/Cip1) protein expression were attenuated selectively in normal stromal and epithelial cell cultures, yet maintained their p53-dependency in malignant cell lines. IR-induced apoptotic cell kill was minimal (less than 6% cell after a dose of 10 Gy at times of 24-96 h) and was not dose-dependent.", "Because of the ability of IR to induce apoptosis in malignant cells, it is frequently used in the treatment of many cancers . In MOLT-4 cells, IR causes increased expression of apoptosis inducing ligand (Apo2L), p53, type 3 inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, Fas, DR5, and Bax . These genes are believed to play critical roles in IR-induced apoptosis. However, of these genes, only Apo2L, Fas, and DR5 are specifically known to be transcriptionally upregulated in response to IR in MOLT-4 cells . Apoptosis induced by IR in MOLT-4 cells is characterized by multiple molecular events which include phosphorylation of stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) , depolarization of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (\u0394 ) , externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) , caspase activation , cleavage of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase , and fragmentation of chromosomal DNA . While it is clear that in MOLT-4 cells IR causes increased expression of specific genes involved in apoptosis, whether or not the altered expression patterns are critical for apoptosis remains unknown. To address this question, we investigated the effects of inhibition of de novo RNA and protein synthesis in IR-induced apoptosis of MOLT-4 cells. We blocked RNA and protein synthesis using act-D and CHX, respectively, prior to apoptotic induction by IR. We demonstrate that IR-induced apoptosis occurs in the presence of act-D but not CHX. These results suggest that in MOLT-4 cells, IR-induced apoptosis is independent of de novo RNA synthesis and dependent on de novo protein synthesis. We show that the required de novo protein synthesis occurs after 2 h post-IR and precedes \u0394 depolarization in the apoptotic cascade. Apoptosis was induced in MOLT-4 cells by exposure to 10 Gy IR. To characterize the apoptotic cell death of MOLT-4 cells following IR, we conducted a series of time course experiments. We measured cell death, PS externalization, and DNA fragmentation at 3 h intervals after IR. Cell death of MOLT-4 cells began to increase 6 h after IR (). We observed that the percentage of cells with externalized PS reached a maximum of 36.5% 12 h after IR (). Based on these results, we measured PS externalization and cell death at 12 h post-IR on all subsequent experiments. Similarly, in response to IR, the percentage of cells with fragmented nuclear chromatin increased in a time-dependent manner and was maximal 24 h after IR (). Therefore, we measured DNA fragmentation at 24 h post-IR in all subsequent experiments. We also observed that following IR, the percentage of cell death (PI positive cells) was greater than DNA fragmentation throughout the time course (). These results suggest that in MOLT-4 cells, IR may cause a decrease in plasma membrane integrity that precedes fragmentation of nuclear chromatin. Treatment with IR alone resulted in PS externalization of 36.5% of the cells while pretreatment with 1 \u03bcg/ml CHX inhibited PS externalization to 11.8% of the population (<0.001). Concentrations greater than 1 \u03bcg/ml CHX resulted in diminished inhibition of IR-induced PS externalization (). IR alone resulted in DNA fragmentation of 31.2% of MOLT-4 cells while pretreatment with 1 \u03bcg/ml CHX inhibited DNA fragmentation to 16.2% of the population (<0.01). Collectively, these results suggest that de novo protein synthesis is required for IR-induced apoptosis. Next, we investigated whether or not de novo RNA synthesis is required for IR-induced apoptosis. However, blocking de novo RNA synthesis with act-D did not inhibit IR-induced PS externalization or cell death at any concentration. Higher concentrations resulted in moderately decreased values of DNA fragmentation from that obtained with 0.1 \u03bcg/ml act-D. Interestingly, concentrations of act-D less than 0.1 \u03bcg/ml did not inhibit IR-induced DNA fragmentation, while concentrations equal to and greater than 0.1 \u03bcg/ml resulted in decreased DNA fragmentation. These results suggest that de novo RNA synthesis is not required for IR-induced apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells. We then investigated how IR-induced \u0394 depolarization is affected by inhibition of de novo protein and RNA synthesis. IR resulted in significant \u0394 depolarization 12 h after irradiation (<0.001). However, pretreatment of cells with CHX prior to IR resulted in dramatic inhibition (<0.001) of IR-induced \u0394 disruption ( ). These results suggest that de novo protein synthesis is required for \u0394 depolarization in IR-induced apoptosis. We then sought to determine the involvement of de novo RNA synthesis in IR-induced \u0394 disruption. This suggests that de novo gene transcription is not required for \u0394 depolarization in IR-induced apoptosis. We conducted time course experiments in which we added CHX to irradiated cells at 2 h intervals after IR (). Addition of CHX as late as 2 h after IR significantly (<0.001) inhibited apoptosis to the same extent as pretreatment with CHX 1 h prior to IR. These results suggest that translation of the proapoptotic protein(s) occurs after 2 h post-IR. For example, IR-induced apoptosis in rat thymocytes requires both de novo RNA and protein synthesis . However, in F9 teratocarcinoma cells, IR-induced apoptosis is independent of both de novo RNA and protein synthesis . In this study, we report that IR-induced apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells is dependent on de novo protein synthesis and independent of de novo RNA synthesis. Similarly, while IR causes increased transcription of proapoptotic genes in MOLT-4 cells , our results suggest that de novo gene transcription is not required for IR-induced apoptosis. In addition to altering gene expression, IR induces numerous apoptotic events . Depolarization of \u0394 is an early event in IR-induced apoptosis . We found that inhibition of de novo protein synthesis, but not RNA synthesis, prevented IR-induced \u0394 depolarization. These findings suggest that de novo protein synthesis is required for IR-induced \u0394 disruption in MOLT-4 cells. We also observed that translation of the required proapoptotic protein(s) occurs after 2 h post-IR. This finding is significant in light of the fact that SAPK/JNK is phosphorylated 1 h after treatment with 10 Gy IR in MOLT-4 cells . Collectively, these results suggest that translation of the proapoptotic protein(s) may occur downstream of SAPK/JNK phosphorylation and upstream of \u0394 depolarization in IR-induced apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells. In summary, we report a unique phenomenon in which apoptosis induced by IR requires de novo protein synthesis but not de novo RNA synthesis. These findings suggest that the mRNA of the gene(s) involved is stabilized to facilitate translation independent of de novo gene transcription in response to IR. Additionally, the proapoptotic protein(s) involved acts upstream of \u0394 depolarization and is translated after 2 h post-IR.", "As the diversity of IR applied in medicine, agriculture, industry, and the growing threats of global terrorism, the acquisition of radioprotectors is an urgent need for the nation. Due to the increased utilization of IR in human life and the growing threats of global terrorism, IR-induced normal tissue morbidities are of further importance to both civilians and military populations, since they are potentially subject to accidental or intentional nuclear mishaps. The term \u201cradioprotector\u201d primarily refers to free radical scavengers that avert the initial radiochemical events in cells following IR exposure. Currently, the majority of potential radioprotective chemical compounds under investigation are designed to scavenge IR-induced free radicals. IR exposure of PBL results in an increase in the intracellular ROS level in PBL.", "To simplify interpretation, we focused on the most upstream event in the insulin signaling cascade: IR autophosphorylation. To that end, CHO-IR cells were loaded with insulin at 4\u00b0C and washed extensively (in the absence of inhibitors), then warmed to 37\u00b0C for 5 min in the presence of IDE inhibitors (10 \u00b5M) or vehicle alone. The degree of insulin-stimulated (but not basal) IR autophosphorylation was consistently potentiated in the presence of Ii1 or the retro-inverso IDE inhibitor, ML3-XF ( Taken together, these results suggest that IDE normally regulates insulin signaling by virtue of its ability to rapidly degrade internalized pools of insulin; correspondingly, insulin signaling can be potentiated significantly by inhibiting IDE proteolytic activity. Expression and purification of IDE-CF-E111Q were performed as previously described IDE activity was quantified by monitoring hydrolysis of FRET1 Recombinant human insulin (Sigma) was applied to CHO-IR cells or HeLa cells grown to near-confluency on 96-well plates under normal cell culture conditions, and its disappearance over time in the presence of different concentrations of IDE inhibitors or vehicle was quantified using a HTRF-based insulin assay (CIS-Bio). CHO-IR cells were a generous gift from Dr. Michel Bernier (National Instutute on Aging) and HeLa cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. CHO-IR cells were cultured on poly-D-lysine glass bottom culture dishes (MatTek Corp.), loaded with FITC-ins CHO-IR cells were grown to near confluency in 6-well plates, washed, then starved for 6 h in insulin-free medium (DMEM/0.1% BSA). Cells were then cold-loaded with human insulin essentially as described Confluent monolayers of CHO-IR cells grown in 6-well culture dishes were cold loaded with 240 pM (0.03 MB DOC) Click here for additional data file.

We found that the elevated basal IR/PI3K/Akt signaling in serum-starved +/\u2212 hepatocytes coincided with decreased Increased insulin- and IL-6\u2013induced An increased rate of hepatic gluconeogenesis is primarily responsible for the enhanced HGP and fasting hyperglycemia that is characteristic of patients with type 2 diabetes ( TCPTP's primary metabolic function may be in the regulation of glucose production since whole-body glucose production and gluconeogenesis, as assessed in hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps and pyruvate tolerance tests, respectively, were reduced in fasted-HFF Recent studies have shown that IRS-1 and IRS-2 can differentially contribute to the regulation of hepatic metabolism, with IRS-1 being more closely linked to glucose metabolism, and IRS-2 to lipid metabolism in the fasted state ( Previous studies have identified PTP1B as an important regulator of hepatic IR signaling and HGP, and these effects have been linked to the regulation of IR-\u03b2 subunit Y1162/Y1163 phosphorylation ( PTP1B's role in IR and leptin signaling has led to considerable attention being focused on PTP1B as a target for development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of both type 2 diabetes and obesity.", "L-2286 significantly reduced the APP-IR axons in CSpT ( The immunohistochemical examination, and the following digital data assessment and statistical analysis, revealed that 100 \u03bcg/rat of i.c.v. L-2286 in both treatment paradigms significantly reduced the density of APP and mid-sized mouse anti-neurofilament clone RMO-14.9 (RMO-14) IR axons after head injury. Treatment immediately and 30 min post-injury reduced the density of APP-IR axons (damaged axons/mm In the assessment of the beam-balance test, sham-injured animals did not display any motor impairment. It should be noted, however, that in the case of RMO-14-IR axons, immediate post-injury treatment appeared to be far more effective, although this difference was not observed in APP-IR axons. Specifically, we demonstrated that RMO-14 and APP-IR axon populations display different reactions to the same neuroprotective intervention, a finding well explained in the aforementioned studies. Based on the finding that there is a strong decrease in the density of damaged IR axonal profiles, we assessed the functional efficacy of the therapeutic strategies applied. Two hours post-injury, animals were sacrificed for immunohistological assessment to determine the dose-response curve in terms of a reduction in the density of damaged IR axons in the corticospinal tract. Impaired axoplasmatic transport, long associated with TAI, was assessed by immunohistochemical detection of APP [ APP or RMO-14 IR axonal profiles were examined using a NIKON light microscope interfaced with a SPOT RT digital camera and a computer-assisted image analysis system (IMAGE-PRO PLUS v5.0.1) in a blinded fashion.

Insulin resistance was assessed using the homeostasis model (HOMA-IR). Elevated CRP were significantly associated with increased mean fasting insulin and mean HOMA-IR concentrations (p < 0.001). Women with CRP concentration >2.53 mg/l (upper tertile) had a 2.18-fold increased risk of IR (OR = 2.18 95% CI 1.51-3.16) as compared with those in the lowest tertile (<0.81 mg/l). Among men, those in the upper tertile had a 2.54-fold increased risk of IR (OR = 2.54 95% CI 1.54-4.20) as compared with those in the lowest tertile. Details of the study setting, sampling, and data collection procedures have been described previously [ Briefly, each participant was interviewed by a trained interviewer using a structured questionnaire validated by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) for assessing the prevalence of non transmissible disease (NTD) risk factors [ As an index of insulin resistance, we determined the Homeostatis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) index by dividing the product of fasting glucose (mg/dl) and fasting insulin (\u03bcIU/ml) by 405 [ All subjects provided informed consent and all research protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of National Institute of Health in Peru, Dos de Mayo Hospital, Peru and the Human Subjects Division at the University of Washington, USA. Associations of CRP with HOMA-IR and other continuous covariates (e.g., insulin and glucose) were determined using the Pearson's correlation coefficients. The distribution of fasting insulin, fasting glucose, and HOMA-IR were skewed to the right side, and the values were transformed to the natural logarithms in the analysis. Mean values of fasting insulin, fasting glucose, and HOMA-IR were compared across the different concentrations of CRP using linear regression procedures. * Data are mean \u00b1 SD, percentages or median (interquartile range) for variables with skewed distributions ** P-value from Chi-Square test for categorical variables or from Student's t-test for continuous variables Table *Adjusted Geometric Mean Values of Fasting Insulin, Fasting Glucose, and HOMA-IR, According to C-Reactive Protein Concentration and Gender.

The present study has shown that IR was associated with CRP, a marker of systemic inflammation, in the Peruvian adult population. After adjusting for BMI, age, and current smoking status, those in the upper tertile (CRP concentration >2.53 mg/l) had more than 2-fold increased risk of IR, compared with those in lowest tertile (CRP concentration <0.81 mg/l) in both men and women. Our observations among Peruvians are in agreement with reports from cross sectional and prospective studies of other populations that showed associations between IR and CRP [ A number of studies have reported that low-grade inflammation is a novel risk factor in all stages of atherosclerosis and acute coronary syndrome [ It has also been shown that CRP, in addition to providing downstream integration to overall cytokine activation, is bound to the membranes of damaged vascular cells where it activates complement proteins or enhances the production of thrombogenic agents [ Some important study limitations must be considered when interpreting the results of our study.", "Using PP2A inhibitors, as well as siRNA targeting various forms of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases, results presented in this report show that specific PP2A inhibition abrogates IR-induced activation of ATR and Chk1 kinases, as well as phosphorylation of Cdc2-Tyr15, and attenuates IR-induced G2/M arrest. These results suggest an important regulation of PP2A on IR-induced G2/M checkpoint signaling response. Results show that PP2A specific activity is required for IR-induced activation of G2/M checkpoint signaling and ultimately G2/M cell cycle arrest. To study the possible role of Ser/Thr phosphatase PP1 and PP2A in IR-induced DNA-damage checkpoint response, we examined the effect of phosphatase inhibitor OA on the activities of PP2A and PP1 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In brief, previously characterized methods were used to quantitate the relative activities of PP1 and PP2A ( We next examined the effect of PP2A inhibition by OA on IR-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest. For these studies, MCF-7 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 0.75 \u03bcM OA for 1 h and then exposed to increasing doses of IR. As shown in As previous studies have shown that G2/M cell-cycle arrest induced by DNA damage requires inhibition of Cdc2/Cycin B complex activity ( We also examined the effect of OA on IR-induced cell cycle response in other cell types, including HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells, T47D human breast cancer cells, U2OS human osteosarcoma cells and HPNE primary human pancreatic ductal cells. As shown in We next examined the effect of OA on the induction of G2/M arrest following IR exposure using a time course experiment. For these studies, MCF-7 cells were exposed to 20-Gy IR in the presence or absence of 0.5 \u03bcM OA and analyzed for DNA content by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) at the indicated times following IR exposure. As shown in As ATM is activated in response to IR, the effect of PP2A inhibition on ATM signaling was determined. For these studies, MCF-7 cells were exposed to 15-Gy IR in the presence or absence of 0.75 \u03bcM OA and incubated for an additional 1 h before analysis. As shown in Previous studies have indicated that ATM is the primary kinase that phosphorylates and activates Chk2 kinase ( Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that activation of ATR signaling is required for the induction of G2/M arrest in MCF-7 cells following IR exposure ( ATR kinase activity was also examined in cells treated with IR and incubated in the presence or absence of OA. As shown in As previous studies have indicated that ATR regulates G2/M checkpoint control through the activation of Chk1 kinase ( We next determined the effect of OA on IR-induced Chk1 kinase activation. As shown in Previous studies indicate that incubation of cells with OA is highly selective for inhibiting PP2A activity in intact cells ( We also examined the time course of the effect of PP2A on the induction of IR-induced G2/M arrest in MCF-7 cells. For these studies, MCF-7 cells transfected with siRNA targeting PP2A-C\u03b1/C\u03b2 were incubated for 2 days at 37\u00b0C and then exposed to 10-Gy IR. After IR treatment, the cells were harvested at the times indicated and analyzed for To determine the effect of PP2A-C knockdown on IR-induced G2/M arrest in other cell types, HEK293 and HNPE cells were transfected with siRNA targeting PP2A-C\u03b1/C\u03b2 and the effect was then examined following irradiation. As shown in As previous studies have shown that SV40-small t antigen binds to PP2A and suppresses PP2A phosphatase activity ( Consistent with the effect of OA on IR-induced G2/M arrest in MCF-7 cells, MCF-7 cells transfected with PP2A-C siRNA also exhibited a marked diminution in Chk1 activation following IR exposure, relative to control siRNA-transfected cells ( We also examined the effect of PP1, another major Ser/Thr phosphatase ( We also compared the effects of PP2A and PP1 on ATM signaling activation following IR exposure. For these studies, MCF-7 cells were transfected with siRNA targeting either PP1-C or PP2A-C\u03b1/C\u03b2, or with control nontargeting siRNA, and the activation of ATM and Chk2 in cells following IR treatment was examined. It has been previously shown that DNA damage induces phosphorylation of the Tyr15 residue of Cdc2, resulting in inhibition of Cdc2/Cyclin B activity and G2/M arrest ( Although previous studies indicate that IR exposure can also induce arrest in G1 in some cell types ( To examine whether PP2A is essential for the maintenance of IR-induced G2/M checkpoint activation, irradiated MCF-7 cells were incubated for 8 h in the absence of OA and then treated with the inhibitor. Under these conditions, inhibition of PP2A by OA several hours after irradiation produced no diminution of IR-induced G2/M arrest (see Both ATM and ATR have important roles in mediating the DNA-damage checkpoint response ( Chk2 activation by DNA damage is a multistep process ( Consistent with the effect of PP2A on IR-induced ATR activation, studies presented in this report indicate that PP2A is also required for Chk1 activation following IR (see A previous study showed that decrease in PP2A-A\u03b1 level in PC12 rat adrenal medulla pheochromocytoma cells by siRNA inhibits PP2A holoenzyme activity and results in apoptosis induction ( In summary, the results presented in this report suggest an important role of PP2A in IR-induced G2/M DNA-damage checkpoint response, which involves its predominant effect on the activation of ATR, Chk1 and Chk2 kinases following IR exposure. Cells were transfected with siRNA at 100 nM using Dharma Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was performed on 20 000 cells using a FACS calibur instrument (Beckon Dickinson, Mansfield, MA, USA), as described previously ( MCF-7 cells were exposed to IR in the presence or absence of 0.5 \u03bcM OA and harvested at 2 h following IR exposure. PP2A inhibition by OA abrogates IR-induced G2/M cell-cycle arrest. ( Effects of PP2A inhibition on IR-induced ATM and ATR signaling activation. ( PP2A-specific inhibition attenuates IR-induced G2/M checkpoint response. The cells were treated with 15-Gy IR or nonirradiated, incubated for an additional 24 h and analyzed for levels of the catalytic subunit of PP4, PP5 and PP6 by western blotting (", "We also demonstrate that acetylation of SMC3 at Lys(105) and Lys(106) is induced by IR and this induction depends on the acetyltransferase ESCO1 as well as the ATM/ATR kinases. Consistently, both ESCO1 and SMC3 acetylation are required for intra-S phase checkpoint and cellular survival after IR. Although both IR-induced acetylation and phosphorylation of SMC3 are under the control of ATM/ATR, the two forms of modification are independent of each other and both are required to promote reinforcement of SMC3 binding to cohesin sites.", "Subsequent studies have shown that TGFbeta is a major mediator of cellular and tissue responses to IR and have revealed novel facets of its complex biology.", "The RIS also increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) IR and complement receptor type 3 (OX-42) IR in the hippocampal CA1 regions and striatum but not PVN. In confocal immunofluorescence study, the IL-1beta IR increased by RIS were colocalized with only NeuN, but not GFAP or OX-42 in the hippocampal CA1 region, striatum and PVN. Our results indicate that RIS increases IL-1beta IR on neuron, but not astrocyte or microglia in the hippocampal CA1 region, striatum and PVN, suggesting that the IL-1beta IR on neuron may play an important role during RIS.", "A technical factor altering the IR of A\u03b2 peptide may have contributed to this underestimation: the use of heat enhances the visualisation of IA\u03b2, but formic acid impedes it [ This point of view has been stimulated by the analysis of Tg mice.", "Highly synergistic effects of IR and 8-Cl-cAMP were observed in both cell lines when examined by the MTT viability and BrdU proliferation assays. The combination of IR and 8-Cl-cAMP at clinically relevant doses exerted substantial growth inhibition. The combination of IR and 8-Cl-cAMP caused a significant disturbance in the distribution of cell cycle phases. The initial resistance to IR-induced apoptosis in these p53-deficient prostate cancer cell lines was overcome through an alternative proapoptotic pathway induced by 8-Cl-cAMP. Considering the low effective doses of treatments, improved tumor eradication rates and minimal undesirable side effects, the combination of IR and 8-Cl-cAMP could be the therapy of choice in treating prostate cancer.", "IR remains one of three main therapy choices for oncology, the others being surgery and chemotherapy. Understanding how cells and tissues respond to IR is essential for improving therapeutic regimes against cancer. Numerous studies demonstrating the changes in the transcriptome following exposure to IR, in diverse systems, can be found in the scientific literature. However, the limitation of our knowledge is illustrated by the fact that the number of transcripts that change after IR exposure is approximately an order of magnitude lower than the number of transcripts that re-localize to or from ribosomes under similar conditions. Furthermore, changes in the post-translational modifications of proteins (phosphorylation, acetylation as well as degradation) are profoundly important for the cellular response to IR. These considerations make proteomics a highly suitable tool for mechanistic studies of the effect of IR. In doing so we hope to provide a strong incentive for the study of proteome-wide changes following IR exposure. For example, in the \u201cradiation bystander effect\u201d described in mammalian cell culture and mice, irradiated cells make their neighbors more prone to death [ The studies described to this point indicate that IR exposure can set into motion multiple primary and secondary cellular responses, some of which function by cell non-autonomous mechanisms. In fact, one could argue that proteomic analyses are required to fully understand short and long-term consequences of IR exposure. It is our hope that this review will provide strong motivation for increased proteomic analyses of IR responses. In fact, damage to membrane lipids occurs after IR exposure and may have a role in signaling through the generation of ceramide [ Regulation of protein synthesis is critically important for the generation of proteins required for cell growth, proliferation and survival [ Translation occurs in three distinct stages: initiation, elongation, and termination ( In contrast to cap-dependent initiation, cap-independent initiation requires only a subset of eIFs and utilizes a structured internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located in the 5' UTR of mRNAs which is capable of binding some of the factors that participate in canonical translation initiation [ In contrast to initiation, a single known mechanism mediates translation elongation. Elongation begins when GTP-bound elongation factor 1 \u03b1 (EF1\u03b1) brings an amino acyl tRNA to the ribosome [ Limited cap-independent initiation occurs in homeostatic cells, for example, during mitosis and differentiation; however it becomes the predominant form of translation during various forms of cellular stress (e.g., IR, hypoxia, lack of nutrients) [ The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway acts to integrate extracellular signals and nutritional status with cellular growth. Recent studies indicate that the EF2 kinase (EF2K), which phosphorylates and inactivates EF2, is modulated in response to genotoxic stress [ Evidence for translational regulation in response to IR comes from several ribosome-profiling studies. For example, in glioblastoma cells numerous mRNAs are recruited to and from polysomes 6 hours after IR exposure [ A similar study that examined glioma, breast, lung and pancreatic cancer cells also showed profound changes in polysome profiles after irradiation [ Following exposure to IR, multiple mechanisms appear capable of inhibiting translation factors that participate in cap-dependent initiation (red fonts in In murine fibroblasts and human leukemia cells, IR exposure activates p21-activated kinase 2 (Pak2, gamma-Pak) [ HuR is an RNA-binding protein that has been shown to bind and regulate the stability and translation rate of many mRNAs encoding proteins for cell proliferation, cell death and stress responses. IR exposure alters the mRNAs that associate with HuR and these changes are dependent on the ATM kinase, a key mediator of DDR [ MDM2 (mouse double minute 2), a protein classically known for mediating p53 degradation appears to have a direct role in translation [ Finally, translation termination factor eRF3 was recently shown to be a target of caspase-mediated degradation following exposure to UV and etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, in multiple cell types [ It has been known for some time that inhibition of protein synthesis modifies radiation responses. Despite significant changes in the transcriptome and in the polysome profile, the resulting changes to the proteasome were modest [ Prior studies suggest that low doses of IR (0.2\u20131 Gy) may yield proteomic responses that are sensitive to experimental design and chance variation and are often contradictory [ ATM kinases are key mediators of DNA damage responses in diverse eukaryotes that range from yeast to humans. Indeed, many candidate markers have been identified in studies of head and neck, breast, prostate and rectal cancers [ Multiple lines of evidence suggest that protein synthesis is not only mis-regulated but also contributes to diseases for which IR is a therapeutic module. Caspases are the obvious proteases active in cells destined to die, but we have yet to reach a comprehensive understanding of whether and how protein stability is altered in surviving cells after IR exposure. Synthesis counter-balanced by degradation could produce protein-to-protein variations in the effect of IR, with many of these changes resulting in functional consequences. Proteome-wide analysis of protein levels coupled with polysome profiles will supplement transcriptome datasets and will help us reach a more complete understanding of responses to IR.

In the current study, we compared the lesions of atherosclerosis after feeding on HFFD for 8 and 16 weeks in an attempt to investigate the short-term effects of HFFD-induced IR on the early-stage lesions as well as the long-term effects of HFFD-induced IR on the advanced lesions of atherosclerosis. It should be pointed out that; however, enhanced aortic and coronary atherosclerosis induced by HFFD occurs through several mechanisms, among which IR may play the major roles. For example, IR can be an antecedent or cause of elevated levels of plasma lipids, adipose tissue accumulation and fatty liver as described above. Therefore, it is conceivable that IR together with elevated plasma lipids and adipose accumulation [ We have shown that HFFD-fed WHHL rabbits showed enhancement of the atherosclerosis.", "Homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) was used as an IR index.

A growing body of evidence suggests that several components of MS may be important co-factors in chronic HCV-infected patients [ MS is now considered to be a clinical entity associated with the presence of IR at the cellular level and with endothelial dysfunction, and its related clinically adverse cardiovascular outcome. The higher prevalence of MS in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, compared with those infected with a non-1 genotype, is interesting and may suggest a specific role of the HCV genotype 1 virus in inducing metabolic abnormalities such as IR [ There is a strong association between MS and treatment outcomes (using PEG-IFN and ribavirin) in patients with chronic hepatitis C. MS was significantly associated with the lack of SVR after adjusting for ethnicity, genotype, obesity, baseline HCV RNA, steatosis and fibrosis.", "We have now studied the role of miR-223, which is also abnormally expressed in the AT of IR subjects. Our data indicates that miR-223 is significantly overexpressed in the AT of IR women, regardless of whether they had PCOS or not. miR-223 expression in AT was positively correlated with HOMA-IR. In conclusion, in AT miR-223 is an IR-related miRNA that may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of IR-related disorders. miRNA genes can be epigenetically regulated and miRNAs can themselves repress key enzymes that drive epigenetic remodeling and directly modulate gene transcription in the nucleus through recognition of specific target sites in promoter regions [ Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders, affecting \u22657\u20139% of reproductive-aged women, even when defined conservatively [ We previously reported that miR-93 is upregulated in adipose tissue (AT) from PCOS and non-PCOS women who display IR [ It is unclear whether miR-223 may also regulate IR in adipocytes. In the present study, we examined the role of miR-223 in the AT of four groups of women: those without PCOS or IR; those without PCOS, but with IR; those with PCOS, but without IR; and women with PCOS and IR. We hypothesized that abnormal expression of miR-223 plays a role in the metabolic dysfunction of PCOS and IR. After incubation, 6-NBDG (20 Insulin resistance at baseline was estimated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR); a HOMA-IR value <2.5 was considered normal and a HOMA-IR value \u22652.5 indicated IR [ Of the 33 subjects included, 15 (7 without and 8 with PCOS) did not have IR as defined. Among the 18 subjects with IR, 8 did not have PCOS and 10 had PCOS. The expression of miR-223 was significantly increased among all women with IR ( Subjects with IR (regardless of the presence of PCOS) tended to have a greater mean body mass index (BMI) than subjects without IR ( To determine the role of and mechanism by which miR-223 induced IR in adipocytes, we overexpressed miR-223 in human differentiated adipocytes As tumor necrosis factor- In a previous study, we examined the expression of miR-223 in AT from a total of 25 subjects, and our findings indicated that miR-223 tended to be overexpressed in PCOS and non-PCOS women with IR [ GLUT4 is the major protein responsible for insulin-mediated glucose translocation into adipocytes [ In the present study, we examined the regulation of GLUT4 expression by miR-223. Although We previously reported that the expression of miR-93 was significantly increased in the subcutaneous abdominal AT of all PCOS patients studied and non-PCOS women with IR [ In addition to our findings that miR-223 and miR-93 regulate IR in AT by targeting GLUT4, these two miRNAs have also been found to suppress proinflammatory activation of macrophages by targeting IRAK4 (for miR-93) [ miR-223 and miR-93 have been found to have similar functions yet they may or may not target the same genes. Both miRNAs regulate cancer activity by targeting the same gene E2F1 [ In conclusion, our data indicates that miR-223 is overexpressed in the subcutaneous AT of subjects with IR, regardless of PCOS status, and that miR-223 expression is positively associated with IR The authors gratefully acknowledge the contribution of the PCOS patients and controls who participated in this study. (a) Depicted is comparison of the levels of miR-223 expression in the AT of women with and without IR; miR-223 was significantly overexpressed in the IR group. (c) Depicted is comparison of the levels of miR-223 expression in the AT of women: (A) without PCOS or IR, (B) without PCOS (non-PCOS), but with IR, (C) with PCOS and IR, and (D) with PCOS, but without IR; the expression of miR-223 was significantly higher in the AT in women with IR. mFG score is the modified Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism score; HOMA-IR is homeostasis model assessment for estimating insulin resistance. Relationship of miR-223 to PCOS and IR status and BMI.", "Mice with villin-Cre-mediated IGF1R or IR deletion in CECs and floxed littermates were fed a high-fat diet to induce obesity and hyperinsulinemia or control low-fat chow. In contrast, IR loss increased CEC apoptosis in both diet groups but did not prevent antiapoptotic effects of obesity. Levels of p53 protein were significantly reduced in CECs of obese mice with intact IR but increased in both lean and obese mice without IR. Levels of mRNAs encoding proapoptotic Perp and the cell cycle inhibitor Cdkn1b/p27 were reduced in CECs of obese mice and increased in lean mice lacking IR. Together, our studies provide novel evidence for antiapoptotic roles of obesity and IR, but not IGF1R, in colonic epithelium after DNA damage. However, neither IR nor IGF1R deletion prevented a reduction in radiation-induced CEC apoptosis during obesity and hyperinsulinemia.", "The RNA concentration was estimated by spectrophoto-meter and only pure RNA ( Mouse metatarsal treated with different growth factors (insulin or IGF-1) or femurs from 3-week-old mice were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, decalcified in 8% Na The mutant or control chondrocytes were plated in six-well plates with the density of 1\u00d710 For comparison of cellular and tissue parameters between the wild-type and mutant mice, the statistical analysis was performed using the Microsoft Excel data analysis program for Student\u2019s To begin to examine the effects of insulin on chondrocytes, we determined the effects of insulin and IGF-1 on the growth of fetal metatarsal rudiments To determine the importance of insulin signaling on growth plate development We next examined the effect of deletion of IR on chondrogenic differentiation in primary chondrocytes. Monolayers were infected with either Ad-GFP or Ad-Cre (100 MOI) and efficiency of the IR deletion was verified by measuring IR mRNA and protein expression 48 h after infection ( The observation of increased chondrocyte numbers in growth plates from the mice lacking IR suggested the possibility of compensatory upregulation of IGF production and signaling, a similar phenomenon previously observed in osteoblasts lacking IGF-1R To begin to address the mechanisms for the decreased size of the hypertrophic chondrocytes in the In the present study, we used the Cre-loxP technique to remove IR from chondrocytes, which has enabled us to determine the contribution of insulin signaling through its cognate receptor. We show that the loss of IR signaling causes upregulation of IGFs and IGF-1R, which appear to act in a compensatory fashion to regulate the proliferation and hypertrophy of chondrocytes. Insulin promotes growth of fetal metatarsal bones Alterations of growth plate development in mice lacking IR in chondrocytes. ( Disruption of IR impairs differentiation of chondrocytes Upregulation of IGF-1R-dependent signaling in chondrocytes lacking IR. ( Disruption of IR decreases size of hypertrophic chondrocytes associated with upregulation of TSC2.", "Current address: Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Sciences Center, San Antonio, TX Despite a recent shift away from anti-insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) therapy, this target has been identified as a key player in the resistance mechanisms to various conventional and targeted agents, emphasizing its value as a therapy, provided that it is used in the right patient population. Molecular markers predictive of antitumor activity of IGF-IR inhibitors remain largely unidentified. The data demonstrate that expression of total IR rather than individual IR isoforms inversely correlates with single agent cixutumumab efficacy in pediatric solid tumor models in vivo. Total IR, IR-A and IR-B expression adversely affects the outcome of cixutumumab in combination with chemotherapy in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of lung adenocarcinoma. IR-A overexpression in tumor cells confers complete resistance to cixutumumab in vitro and in vivo while IR-B results in a partial resistance. Resistance in IR-B-overexpressing cells is fully reversed by anti-IGF-II antibodies, suggesting that IGF-II is a driver of cixutumumab resistance in this setting. The present study links IR isoforms, IGF-II and cixutumumab efficacy mechanistically and identifies total IR as a biomarker predictive of intrinsic resistance to anti-IGF-IR antibody. This study identifies total IR as a biomarker predictive of primary resistance to IGF-IR antibodies, and provides a rationale for new clinical trials enriched for patients whose tumors display low IR expression. For more than two decades, the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system, which includes receptors (IGF-IR, IGF-IIR, insulin receptor), ligands (IGF-I and IGF-II) and high affinity IGF binding proteins (IGFBP1\u20136), has been studied with great interest in cancer biology. While this highly-regulated pathway plays a crucial role in the normal development and growth of tissues, its deregulation contributes to tumor initiation, proliferation and survival ( Over the last decade, a number of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) directed against IGF-IR have made their way into clinical trials ( In the present study, we provide evidence that IR, irrespective of isoform type, mediates primary resistance to IGF-IR targeted therapy and can be used as a potential biomarker for patient selection.

A549, NCI-H1299 and MCF-7 cells were cultured in F-12 HAM, RPMI 1640 and IMEM medium, respectively, supplemented with 1X GlutaMAX supplement (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO Plasmids with cDNA encoding the IR-A and IR-B sequence were generated at Eli Lilly. cDNAs encoding IR isoforms were amplified with 5\u2019TATACTAGTATGGCCACCGGGGGAAGGAG-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-TAATCTAGACTAAGAAGGATTGGACCGAGGC-3\u2019 primers, digested with Spe-I and Xba-I and ligated into pLVX-IRES-puro HIV-1-based lentiviral expression vector (Clontech \u00ae, Mountain View, CA, USA). A549, NCI-H1299 and MCF-7 cells were transduced with the respective virus for 48 hours and then cultured in the presence of puromycin (1 \u00b5g/ml) for selection of stably transduced A549 (A549-Mock, A549-IR-A, A549-IR-B), NCI-H1299 (NCI-H1299-Mock, NCI-H1299-IR-A, NCI-H1299-IR-B) and MCF-7 (MCF-7-Mock, MCF-7-IR-A, MCF-7-IR-B) variants. ( Experimental studies in xenograft models of pediatric solid tumors were conducted through Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) and have been described previously ( To study the antitumor efficacy of cixutumumab in xenograft A549 model with overexpression of IR isoforms, mice (n=30 for each variant) were subcutaneously injected with 2 \u00d7 10 Tumor size was measured twice weekly via calipers. RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically with the OD Commercial TaqMan Gene Expression assays were purchased from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY, USA) for quantification of total IR (INSR, Assay ID: Hs00961554_m1), IGF-IR (IGF-IR, Assay ID: Hs00609566_m1), IGF-I (IGF-I, Assay ID: Hs01547656_m1), IGF-II (IGF-II, Assay ID: Hs01005963_m1) and EGFR (EGFR, Assay ID: Hs01076078_m1). Full length mRNA transcript sequences for IR-A (NM_001079817) and IR-B (NM_000208) isoforms were retrieved from the NCBI Reference Sequence database. The IR-B TaqMan Gene Expression assay was designed using the Custom TaqMan Assay Design Tool from Life Technologies. Custom-made primers/probe sequence for IR-B includes: probe sequence: 5\u2019-TCCCCAGAAAAACCTC-3\u2019, forward primer: 5\u2019-CCTGCACAACGTGGTTTTCG-3\u2019 and reverse primer: 5\u2019-CGGCACCAGTGCCTGAA-3\u2019. To confirm specificity of the IR-B probe, spiking experiments were performed utilizing plasmids containing cDNA encoding IR-A or IR-B. It was not possible to identify completely specific TaqMan probes to IR-A. IR-A expression levels were, therefore, calculated by subtracting IR-B values from total IR values. Student\u2019s To understand the prevalence of IGF-IR, IR-A and IR-B mRNA expression in patient tumor samples, we evaluated mRNA levels of IGF-IR and IR isoforms using TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) RNA-seq data from 6,943 samples representing 21 tumor types. These results suggest that expression of all three receptors significantly varies between tumor types and individual tumors ( As previously demonstrated ( It is important to state that cixutumumab exhibits equipotent binding to both human and mouse IGF-IR and is therefore suitable for xenograft studies in mice. We observed elevated levels of growth hormone, IGF-I and insulin in the circulation of mice treated with cixutumumab ( To understand if baseline IR and IGF-IR expression in tumor tissue is predictive of cixutumumab efficacy It is known that IGF-I primarily stimulates IGF-IR whereas IGF-II is capable of activating both IGF-IR and IR-A. As demonstrated by qPCR, IGF-I expression was barely detectable in most samples (range: 0\u20131,100, mean 74 copies/ng cDNA) while IGF-II was expressed at markedly high levels (range: 0\u2013107,723, mean 23,657 copies/ng cDNA) in a significant number of tumor models ( Clinical data indicate that IGF-IR antibodies display rather weak single agent activity in epithelial tumors, and in most trials they were used in combination with other antitumor agents including chemotherapy. We therefore tried to understand if baseline IGF-IR and IR expression was associated with the antitumor efficacy of cixutumumab used in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin, which is a standard of care in NSCLC with non-squamous histology. When combined with chemotherapy, cixutumumab displayed significantly improved efficacy over chemotherapy alone in 3 out 9 patient-derived models of lung adenocarcinoma (LA) ( To understand if there is a mechanistic link between individual IR isoforms and cixutumumab resistance, we developed stably transduced variants of NSCLC and breast cancer cell lines (A549, NCI-H1299 and MCF-7) that overexpress either IR-A or IR-B. A549, NCI-H1299 and MCF-7 cells display sensitivity to cixutumumab when tested A previous study has shown that IGF-II acting though IR-A could be accountable for the limited efficacy of anti-IGF-IR therapy ( IGF-IR mAbs have been tested in multiple clinical trials ( The objective of our study was to explore the role of the insulin receptor as a potential negative predictive biomarker for IGF-IR targeted therapy. To our knowledge, this study is the first report demonstrating the adverse impact of both IR isoforms on the efficacy of IGF-IR mAb, cixutumumab. Based on epidemiological studies, obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) were found to be associated with increased cancer risk and mortality ( In previously published studies, the role of individual IR isoforms as a potential mechanism of intrinsic resistance to IGF-IR targeting had not been dissected, although studies in Ewing\u2019s sarcoma cell lines with almost exclusive expression of IR-A (~100% of total IR) support a role of this isoform in the development of drug resistance ( In normal tissue, the two IR isoforms mediate very distinct functions. IR-B, which primarily is expressed in the liver, muscle and fat tissue, regulates metabolic functions while IR-A, highly expressed in various tissues during prenatal life, mediates proliferative and antiapoptotic effects ( Earlier publications reported different ligand specificity for the two IR isoforms. Insulin is known to bind to both IR-A and IR-B. IGF-II binds to IR-A with an affinity similar to insulin and seems to be also capable of binding to IR-B with several fold lower affinity ( IGF-II targeting may thus represent an interesting alternative to the anti-IGF-IR blockade, with the advantage of reducing signaling via IR. BI-836845 and MEDI-573 are fully human mAbs currently in preclinical and clinical development, respectively, which neutralize both IGF-I and IGF-II and are efficacious in experimental tumor models ( IGF-IR TKIs are known to block both IGF-IR and IR tyrosine kinase activity ( Based on the current findings, we argue that discovery of suitable biomarkers to guide patient selection should become a priority to enable successful IGF-IR targeted therapy. Previous work based on expression profiling in sarcoma and neuroblastoma identified potential predictors of intrinsic and acquired resistance to IGF-IR inhibition. Higher levels of IGF-I, IGF-II and IGF-IR were linked to a better response to IGF-IR TKI whereas IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-6 overexpression were observed in resistant models ( Furthermore, while many pharmaceutical companies discontinued their IGF-IR programs in Oncology, there is growing evidence that IGF-IR pathway is implicated in the development of resistance to novel targeted agents (ALK inhibitors, next generation EGFR TKIs) ( The following authors are employees of Eli Lilly and Company: A. Correlation analysis of total IR Growth curves of patient-derived lung adenocarcinoma xenograft tumors in response to cixutumumab, cisplatin/pemetrexed or cixutumumab/cisplatin/pemetrexed. Two IR isoforms confer resistance to cixutumumab Insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) mediates resistance to cixutumumab in tumor cells over-expressing IR-B. Clonogenic assay in A549 cells that overexpress IR-B", "IR increased autophagy level by more than 129% in DMSO-treated cells, while only by 47% and 27% in KU55933-treated and ATM(-/-) cells respectively. MAPK14 knock-down alone gave rise to the basal autophagy level, but decreased notably after IR. KU55933 and ATM knock-down inhibited IR-induced autophagy by activating mTOR pathways. ATM promoted IR-induced autophagy via the MAPK14 pathway, mTOR pathway and Beclin1/PI3KIII complexes.", "Several pathways were uniquely regulated by EVLP+ATL1223 including the downregulation of genes involved in IL-1 signaling such as ADCY9, ECSIT, IRAK1, MAPK12 and TOLLIP. From the analysis, a noticeably greater number of IL-1 signaling genes were down-regulated in the EVLP+ATL1223 group including down-regulation of ADCY9, ECSIT, IRAK1, MAPK12 and TOLLIP ( Our group and others have demonstrated in preclinical models that DCD lungs with extended warm ischemic times (up to 60 minutes) may be rehabilitated by EVLP to an acceptable state for transplantation ( The present study introduces a novel murine model of EVLP of DCD lungs, which provides a fundamental framework for future studies aimed toward identifying potential predictive markers of PGD after EVLP and transplantation as well as the assessment of novel targeted therapies for EVLP-mediated donor lung rehabilitation. Importantly, EVLP with A Because lungs are perfused with acellular Steen solution, neutrophil numbers in lungs were overall lower than what is typically observed after IR A traditional measure of lung function during EVLP, often used to predict successful transplantation, has been the partial pressure of oxygen (PO Gene expression analysis revealed a large number of canonical pathways, including many associated with inflammation and innate immune responses, that are significantly affected by EVLP, with the overall affect being downregulation of most genes in these pathways. The induction of inflammatory responses after reperfusion is believed to be the major contributor to IR injury and PGD after transplantation, and the present study suggests that proinflammatory responses in DCD lungs occur quickly after perfusion and that EVLP with Steen solution effectively attenuates these responses via modulation of the expression of many proinflammatory genes.", "Alternative methods based on surrogate markers derived from fasting insulin and glucose, such as the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), have been validated and proposed [ This research aims to determine the optimal cutoff value of HOMA-IR for MetS diagnosis in healthy adolescents, to examine whether IR assessed by using this cutoff value is related to anthropometric, metabolic, and cardiovascular risk profile, and to evaluate the association of IR with genetic, biological, and environmental factors. A HOMA-IR value of 2.6 showed the best sensitivity (59%) and specificity (87%) for diagnosing MetS (AUC: 0.821; correctly classified: 87%; LR+: 4.5) ( As shown in In this cohort of healthy Chilean adolescents of low to middle SES, the optimal cutoff point of HOMA-IR for IDF MetS diagnosis was 2.6 (sensitivity: 59% and specificity: 87%). Adolescents with HOMA-IR \u2265 2.6 showed a significantly higher prevalence of obesity (40.4%), abdominal obesity (61.5%), hypertriglyceridemia (20.4%), high blood pressure (18.4%), fasting hyperglycemia (19.3%), and MetS (33.0%). Thus, HOMA-IR of 2.6 or higher would find young individuals with greater biological risk. In adolescents, HOMA-IR values ranging from 2.2 to 5.3 have been reported as cutoff for diagnosing MetS, but these studies vary greatly in their design, sample size, age and nutritional status of participants, and degree of pubertal development [ In this sample, FHDM, obesity, sarcopenia, and low adiponectin were all independently associated with a significant increased risk of IR. All these factors have been recognized as important determinants of IR and TD2 in pediatric populations [ This research has limitations that should be considered when interpreting its results. One limitation is that we estimated sarcopenia from DEXA scans and calculated fat-free mass rather than a more direct method of assessing muscle mass [ This research provides results that confirm that in adolescents a value of HOMA-IR \u2265 2.6 is associated with greater cardiovascular and metabolic risk [ This research was carried out with financial support from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and National Institutes of Health (USA), under Grant R01HL088530-2980925. ROC curve to determine the optimal cutoff value of HOMA-IR for MetS diagnosis in healthy adolescents. Prevalence rates of cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors by HOMA-IR. Significance level: Background characteristics of adolescents in the sample by insulin sensitivity ( Association between IR and sex, obesity, sarcopenia, low adiponectin, life-style habits, and HFDM2 in adolescents ( Influence of FHDM, physical inactivity, sarcopenia, obesity, and low adiponectin over the risk of insulin resistance ( OR [95% CI]: odd ratio [95% confidence interval].", "We have recently reported that expression of Dclk1, a Tuft cell and tumor stem cell (TSC) marker, 24h after high dose total-body gamma-IR (TBI) can be used as a surrogate marker for crypt survival. C57BL/6 mice received a 6% pectin diet and 0.5% pectin drinking water (pre-IR mice received pectin one week before TBI until death; post-IR mice received pectin after TBI until death). Animals were exposed to TBI (14 Gy) and euthanized at 24 and 84h post-IR to assess ISC deletion and crypt survival respectively. In pre-IR treatment group, we observed a three-fold increase in ISC/crypt survival, a two-fold increase in Dclk1+ stem cells, increased overall survival (median 10d vs. 7d), and increased expression of Dclk1, Msi1, Lgr5, Bmi1, and Notch1 (in small intestine) post-TBI in pectin treated mice compared to controls. We also observed increased survival of mice treated with pectin (post-IR) compared to controls. Dietary pectin is a radioprotective agent; prevents IR-induced deletion of potential reserve ISCs; facilitates crypt regeneration; and ultimately promotes overall survival. The resultant mucosal ulceration (mucositis), pain, and related sequel are a cause of significant morbidity [ The adult intestinal epithelium is continuously and rapidly replaced by cell replication within the crypts of Lieberk\u00fchn, and subsequent migration of their progeny takes place onto the villus epithelium in the small intestine, or onto the surface epithelium in the colon [ Agents given before the radiation treatments are termed radioprotectors, where as agents given after treatment are termed radiation mitigators [ Here, we report that dietary citrus pectin is a radioprotective agent, prevents IR-induced deletion of ISCs, facilitates crypt regeneration, and promotes overall animal survival. One set of mice were euthanized at 24h post-IR for IHC and mRNA analysis. A second set were given BrdUrd at 82h post-IR and then euthanized at 84h for the microcolony assay. The final set of mice was subjected to overall animal survival studies up to 288h post-IR\u2014times of death were noted. After washing, slides were devolved with Diaminobenzidine (Sigma\u2014Aldrich) [ Following the IR treatment, animals were euthanized at 3.5d (84h). A surviving crypt was defined as containing five or more adjacent, BrdUrd-positive nuclei [ Following the IR treatment mice in the pre-IR pectin and post-IR pectin groups were kept on pectin diet and pectin water and mice in control group were kept on normal diet and water and monitored for survival (n = 6 in each group). Overall survival was defined as the time interval between the completion of IR and the final euthanasia. Total RNA isolated from mouse intestines (24h post-IR) (n = 3 per group and one sample per mouse) was subjected to reverse transcription with Superscript II RNase H\u2014Reverse Transcriptase and random hexanucleotide primers. 82 h post-IR, these mice were injected with BrdUrd, then euthanized at 84h post-IR. Panel B is the high-powered magnified images of the panel A and panel D is the high-powered image of panel C. The average number of surviving crypts per cross section was counted for total of 30 cross sections and is presented in panel C. The values in the bar graph are given as average \u00b1 SEM and * denotes statistically-significant differences (* C57BL/6 mice (n = 6) on control diet died at an average of 6.7 days (with a median value of 7 days and 95% CI = 5\u20137.5 days) after treatment, whereas mice (n = 6) pretreated with pectin diet on average lived beyond 10 days (with a median value of 10 days and 95% CI = 9\u201312 days) post-14 Gy IR ( (A and B) Pre-IR pectin treatment: C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with either control or pectin diet for one week prior to 14 Gy IR injury (n = 6 in each group). (C and D) Post-IR pectin treatment: C57BL/6 mice were subjected to 14 Gy IR injury and fed with control or pectin diet (n = 6 in each group). (E) Table represents the Median and the 95% CI values in the pre-IR pectin treatment and post-IR pectin treatments. Control mice in the pre-IR pectin treatments had a median survival of 7 d with a 5\u20137.5 d 95% CI; Pectin treated mice had a median survival of 10 d with a 9\u201312 d 95% CI. In the post-IR pectin groups, control mice had a median survival of 5.5 d with a 5\u20136 d 95% CI; pectin treated animals had a median survival of 6.5 d with a 6\u20137 d 95% CI. To demonstrate the effect of post-IR pectin treatment, animals were initially treated with 14 Gy TBI and fed with control (n = 6) or pectin (n = 6) diet ( In order to demonstrate whether ISCs are protected and are responsible for the increased crypt and overall survival of mice pretreated with pectin, we performed mRNA and protein analysis of genes that are known to play an important role in stem cells. Results from our previous studies demonstrated that the number of Dclk1+ stem cells at 24h post-IR is an indicator of surviving crypts at 84h post-IR [ C57BL/6 mice in the control group (A) and the pectin-treated group (B) were subjected to 14 Gy TBI. 24h post-IR, the small intestines were isolated, fixed, processed, and stained with anti-Dclk1 antibody (n = 3 in each group). The average number of Dclk1 positive cells per cross section was counted for total of 30 cross sections and presented in panel C. The values in the bar graph are given as average \u00b1 SEM and * denotes statistically-significant differences (* Total RNA isolated from the intestines of 24h post-IR samples (n = 3) was subjected to RT-PCR for stem cell related genes such as Dclk1, Msi1, Lgr5, Bmi1, and Notch1. These chemicals included amino-acid cysteine and thiol compounds [ In this study, mice pre-treated with dietary citrus pectin (in animal feed and drinking water) were subjected to high-dose IR (14 Gy). For the microcolony assay, one set of mice were administered BrdUrd at 82 h post-IR and killed at 84h. The other set of mice were subjected to overall animal survival studies up to 288h post-IR\u2014times of death were noted.", "To test the neuroprotective efficacy of Cordyceps sinensis mycelium (CSM) in a rat model of focal cerebral IR, ischemic animals were treated with CSM. CSM significantly inhibited IR-induced up-regulation of NF-kappaB activation and the brain production of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, iNOS, ICAM-1, and COX-2.", "As shown ( In conclusion, we have demonstrated a post-translational method allowing site-specific incorporation of nitrile-based IR probes into peptides and proteins via cysteine alkylation or arylation. Materials, methods and FTIR spectra are available free of charge via the Internet at", "In this study, we tested whether the status of PTEN determined fate of the cell by examining PTEN-deficient U87, U251, and U373, and PTEN-proficient LN18 and LN428 glioma cells after exposure to IR. Furthermore, transfection with wild-type (wt) PTEN or AKT small interfering RNA induced a change from premature senescence to apoptosis and depletion of p53 or p21 prevented IR-induced premature senescence in U87 cells. Our data indicate that PTEN acts as a pivotal determinant of cell fate, regarding senescence and apoptosis in IR-exposed glioma cells.", "Furthermore, MSH6 exhibited diffuse nuclear staining in the majority of untreated cells and forms discrete nuclear foci after NCS or IR treatment. MSH6 colocalizes with \u03b3-H2AX at sites of DNA damage after NCS or IR treatment. MSH6-deficient cells were hypersensitive to NCS- or IR-induced cell death, as revealed by a clonogenic cell-survival assay. To visualize \u03b3-ray- or NCS-induced foci, untreated cells or cells treated with 100 ng/ml NCS were cultured on coverslips coated with poly- After treatment with NCS or IR, 5 \u00d7 10 DSB repair was assayed by alkaline single-cell agarose-gel electrophoresis as described previously. For production of DSBs, HeLa cells were treated with 100 ng/ml of the radiomimetic drug NCS or 5 Gy of IR. Immunoprecipitation with anti-MSH6 antibodies revealed that endogenous MSH6 bound Ku70 and that treatment with NCS or IR increased the amount of MSH6 bound to Ku70 ( MSH6 interacts with Ku70. ( To confirm these results, we also measured the persistence of DSB in NCS- or IR-treated HeLa cells stably transfected with MSH6 or control shRNA by single-cell electrophoresis (the comet assay). NCS or IR treatment induces DSBs, visible as increased DNA mobility or \u2018comet tails\u2019. At 30 min after NCS or IR treatment, control and MSH6-knockdown cells exhibited comparable levels of DNA damage. However, when the persistence of unrepaired DNA-strand breaks was analyzed at a various times after NCS or IR treatment, cells depleted of MSH6 exhibited significantly lower repair efficiency than control cells ( MSH6 knockdown results in decreased DSB repair. ( Since radiosensitivity of cells is also affected by proteins involved in DSB repair, we monitored the survival of cells depleted of MSH6 after exposure to NCS or IR. The sensitivity of the cells to NCS or IR was examined by assaying colony formation after NCS or IR treatment. Second, we found that Ku70 co-immunoprecipitates with MSH6 from HeLa cell extracts and that this interaction is enhanced after radiomimetic NCS or IR exposure. Third, MSH6 forms NCS- or IR-induced nuclear foci that colocalize with \u03b3-H2AX at the sites of DNA breaks. An early step in the cellular response to DSBs is phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX ( NHEJ was previously reported to be decreased in MMR-deficient colon cancer cell lines in comparison to MMR-proficient cells ( Cell lines defective for any of the DSB repair genes are generally highly sensitive to IR and have marked deficiencies in DSB repair ( Although this is the first report demonstrating that MSH6 regulates MHEJ activity, many questions remain regarding how NHEJ is actually regulated by the MSH6.", "In this study, the expression of scaffold proteins JIP1 and JIP3 and their roles in the regulation of JNK activity were investigated in simulated IR in a cell model (H9c2). JIP1 protein expression was significantly decreased, whereas JIP3 protein expression was increased in IR H9c2 cells. Adenovirus-induced overexpression of JIP1 reduced IR-induced JNK activity and apoptosis. Conversely, overexpression of JIP3 increased JNK activity and apoptosis following IR. Depletion of endogenous JIP1 by siRNA treatment increased the IR-induced JNK activity, whereas siRNA-mediated depletion of endogenous JIP3 inhibited JNK activity. These results suggest that JIP1 and JIP3 play important roles in the activation of JNK during simulated IR challenge in H9c2 cells.", "Serum CRP and WBC were significantly correlated with HOMA-IR and risk factors of IR. Relative risks of IR for each 1-SD increase of Ln (CRP) and Ln (WBC) were 1.28 (1.10-1.47) and 1.15 (1.01-1.31), respectively after adjustment for age, sex, obesity measurements, and other traditional risk factors. Additional adjustment for WBC slightly attenuated the association between CRP and IR [1.25 (1.08-1.45); P = 0.003] whereas adjustment for CRP substantially attenuated the association of WBC with IR toward null (P = 0.134). Moreover, individuals with both high levels of CRP and WBC were at higher risks of IR than those with high CRP or WBC alone. Both CRP and WBC were significantly associated with risks of IR. CRP might be a more effective biomarker in terms of the association with IR.", "Excessive complement activation following IR induces endothelial cell injury, altering vascular and endothelial barrier function causing tissue dysfunction. To mitigate the IR response, various systemic anti-complement therapies have been tried. The etiology of ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is multi-factorial and occurs in a variety of clinical scenarios including replantation of traumatic limb amputations or transplantation of tissues/organs. All tested concentrations appeared to functionalize membranes in a dose-dependent manner ( In surgical procedures that could benefit from localized anti-complement therapy to reduce IRI, a BioFLV incubation time of < 40 min seems reasonable. The results demonstrated that as BioFLV incubation time increased, membrane biotinylation also increased in a dose-dependent manner ( Since the success of any anti-complement therapy in IRI is dependent on the duration of its action in the first 24 h, in vivo experiments were conducted to determine whether biotin linked SA-FITC remained incorporated on the endothelial surface of vessels after 48 h of reperfusion. In contrast, elective procedures involving In the immediate post-operative period, IR-induced excessive complement activation has been implicated in delayed graft function of transplanted organs and also as a contributing factor for acute and chronic rejection. Furthermore, in IRI where the endogenous complement regulatory proteins on endothelial cells are overwhelmed, this therapy can be easily administered Display of biotin tethers on fibroblast cell membranes is altered by biotinylated fusogenic lipid vesicle (BioFLV) formulation.", "There is no effective pharmacologic agent available to prevent the release of high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1) or to ameliorate IR injury. This pilot study sought to develop a model in beagle dogs for the purpose of testing the efficacy of a necrosis modulator, necrox-7, to prevent hepatic IR injury in beagle dogs. Liver biopsy demonstrated marked necrosis and inflammatory infiltrates in group A, whereas group B showed little evidence of IR injury. This pilot study developed a hepatic IR injury model, demonstrating that necrox-7 reduced hepatic necrosis secondary to IR injury in a large animal setting.", "Here we tested the hypothesis that the absence of CD36 protects mice from IR associated with diet-induced obesity and hyperlipidaemia. Adipose tissue from These data suggest that a CD36-dependent inflammatory paracrine loop between adipocytes and macrophages facilitates chronic inflammation and contributes to IR common in obesity and dyslipidaemia. After, GTT was greatly impaired in WT vs. Protection from diet-induced IR in CD36 CD36 has been shown to be a co-receptor for Toll-like receptors (TLRs). To control for degree of adiposity as a potential confounder, we studied 12-week HFD-fed apolipoprotein E null ( To identify sites of IR, HFD-fed WT and CD36 contributes to inflammation and macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue after HFD. Metabolic stress from HFD feeding is also known to cause activation of the regulatory mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase JNK and trigger the development of IR. JNK can directly induce IR by serine phosphorylation of the adapter protein, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), at inhibitory sites which in turn decreases IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and blocks insulin receptor signalling. Plasma from HFD-fed An important feature of adipose tissue inflammation and IR is the predominance of a classical M1 pro-inflammatory macrophage vs. an M2 anti-inflammatory tissue-residing macrophage. Similar to To understand the functional implications of oxLDL-mediated changes in p-JNK, p-IRS-1, and p-AKT, we examined the effect of oxLDL on physiologic correlates of insulin sensitivity in 3T3L1 adipocytes. We next used an In this report, we provide multiple lines of Although our work and work by others have shown that macrophage scavenger receptors are sometimes associated with an anti-inflammatory phenotype because of their role in the clearance of apoptotic cells and resolution of inflammation, The contribution of CD36 to IR is controversial. Some genetic cohort studies suggest that CD36 protects against IR, Diabetes and IR increase inflammation and ROS which may contribute to atherosclerosis by both creating modified LDL ligands and causing endothelial dysfunction. Some studies have suggested that adipose tissue macrophages are both necessary and sufficient for the development of IR in obesity. To further examine the contribution of macrophage CD36 to HFD-induced IR, we analyzed data from a prior study from our group in which bone marrow (BM) transplantation was used to determine the role of macrophage CD36 in atherosclerosis. Our data provide evidence that absence of CD36 protects mice from IR associated with diet-induced obesity and hyperlipidaemia and that CD36 ligands such as oxLDL are capable of mediating a CD36-dependent inflammatory paracrine loop between adipocytes and their associated macrophages. This facilitates chronic inflammation in adipose tissue and contributes to the IR common in obesity and dyslipidaemia ( CD36 contributes to inflammation and impaired insulin signalling in adipocytes and macrophages.", "However, the role of miRNAs in IR-induced senescence has not been well defined. Thus, the purpose of this study is to identify and characterize senescence-associated miRNAs (SA-miRNAs) and to investigate the role of SA-miRNAs in IR-induced senescence. In human lung fibroblasts (WI-38 cells), premature senescence was induced either by IR or busulfan (BU) treatment, and replicative senescence was accomplished by serial passaging. The role of SA-miRNAs in IR-induced senescence was characterized by knockdown of miRNA expression with anti-miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs) or by miRNA overexpression through the transfection of pre-miRNA mimics. We identified 8 SA-miRNAs, 4 of which were up-regulated (miR-152, -410, -431, and -493) and 4 which were down-regulated (miR-155, -20a, -25, and -15a), that are differentially expressed in both prematurely (induced by IR or BU) and replicatively senescent WI-38 cells. Functional analyses revealed that knockdown of miR-155 or -20a, but not miR-25 or -15a, markedly enhanced IR-induced senescence, whereas ectopic overexpression of miR-155 or miR-20a significantly inhibited senescence induction. Furthermore, our studies indicate that miR-155 modulates IR-induced senescence by acting downstream of the p53 and p38 MAPK pathways and in part via regulating tumor protein 53-induced nuclear protein 1 (TP53INP1) expression. Our results suggest that SA-miRNAs are involved in the regulation of IR-induced senescence, so targeting these miRNAs may be a novel approach for modulating cellular response to radiation exposure. Previous studies implicate miRNAs in senescence and aging, which includes the observation that overexpression of miRNA We and others have demonstrated that IR exposure induces premature senescence in a variety of cells and tissues both WI-38 cells (human embryonic lung diploid fibroblasts) obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were maintained and cultured as previously described ( SA-\u03b2-gal staining and BrdU incorporation assays were used to determine cellular senescence as previously described ( Western blotting analysis was performed as previously described ( Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and quantified using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer. Differences were considered significant at To indentify SA-miRNAs and elucidate their roles in regulating cellular senescence, we induced cellular senescence in WI-38 cells by serial passaging, exposure to IR, or treatment with the alkylating agent BU as previously described ( As shown in To validate the microarray results, we profiled the expression signature of SA-miRNAs in senescent versus control WI-38 cells. We compared the SA-miRNA expression of quiescent and SV40 transformed cells with that of senescent cells as shown in Oncogenic stress-induced senescence represents an important type of cellular senescence, which significantly contributes to tumor prevention ( The SA-miRNA profiling data showed that no significant changes were observed in the levels of miR-493 and miR-410 in Ras-transduced senescent cells versus pBabe-transduced cells ( Next, we investigated whether any of the 4 down-regulated SA-miRNAs might play a role in regulating IR-induced premature senescence. AMOs (also known as antagomirs) is an effective tool to knock down miRNAs ( We also performed gain-of-function (GOF) analysis of SA-miRNAs by transfecting the cells with pre-miRNA precursors to determine if exogenous overexpression of SA-miRNAs influences IR-induced senescence. As shown in Because tumor suppressor p53 is a key regulator of DNA damage responses (DDR) and IR-induced cell cycle arrest ( To determine if the p38 MAPK pathway is implicated in the regulation of SA-miRNAs, we used SB203580 to pharmacologically inhibit the p38 MAPK pathway and performed SA-miRNA expression profiling of irradiated WI-38 cells. MiR-34a has been shown to be a transcriptional target of p53, and exogenous overexpression of miR-34a induces senescence in tumor cells ( To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that knockdown of endogenous miR-155 or miR-20a with AMOs enhances IR-induced senescence, whereas exogenous overexpression of miR-155 or miR-20a attenuates senescence. To identify such targets of miR-155, we found that TP53INP1 is a target of miR-155 that is likely involved in modulating IR-induced senescence. Our data also show that inhibition of TP53INP1 by siRNA attenuates IR-induced senescence in WI-38 cells. Our observations are in agreement with the previous studies showing that over expression of TP53INP1 induces DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest in both p53-dependent and p53-independent manners ( Given the importance of p53 pathway in regulating DDR and IR-induced cell cycle arrest ( In summary, our studies indicate that down-regulation of miR-155, \u221220a, \u221225, and \u221215a is a characteristic miRNA expression profile of senescence and that SA-miRNAs are implicated in the regulation of IR-induced senescence. This study was partially supported by CA08860, CA122023, ACS IRG-97-219-08, AI067770-05 and NIH RR014516. Induction of senescence in WI-38 cells was performed by serial passaging, exposure to 10 Gy IR, or treatment with the alkylating agent busulfan (BU, 120 \u03bcM) as previously described ( TaqMan MicroRNA Assays were used to determine the expression levels of SA-miRNAs in senescent WI-38 cells. The levels of up-regulated (A) and down-regulated (B) SA-miRNAs in replicatively senescent cells (Rep) and prematurely senescent cells (induced by IR and BU) were normalized to the control cells and graphed. Kinetic changes of up-regulated (C) and down-regulated (D) SA-miRNAs versus time after IR were plotted. A. upper panel, representative pictures of IR-induced senescent cells showing SA-\u03b2-gal positive staining (Blue); lower panel, representative pictures of proliferating cells that are positive for BrdU staining (Green). a, A. WI38 cells were doubly transfected (48 hr prior to and 3 days post IR) with either 100 nM p53 siRNA (siRNA) or 100 nM control scramble oligonucleotides (Scr). Seven days post IR, SA-miRNA expression levels in irradiated cells were determined by real-time RT-PCR and normalized to those of control cells.", "In comparison with the model group, the number of cortical P 16 IR-positive neurons reduced significantly in M-ST 36-GB 39, M-GV 20-CV 4 and medication groups (P < 0.01), and those of cortical pRb and c-fos IR-positive neurons increased remarkably in M-ST 36-GB 39, M-GV 20-CV 4 and medication groups (P < 0.01, P < 0.05).", "It also diminished insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, PI3K (p85), and serine phosphorylation of Akt without affecting the phosphorylation of IR, ERK1/2, P38, and JNK. LYRM1 regulates the function of IRS-1, PI3K, and Akt, and decreases GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in response to insulin.", "Thus, targeting the inflammatory signaling pathways induced by IR offers the opportunity to improve the clinical outcome of radiation therapy by enhancing radiosensitivity and decreasing putative metabolic effects. Since inflammation and sex steroids also impact tumorigenesis, a therapeutic approach targeting glucocorticoid receptors and radiation-induced production of tumorigenic factors might be effective in sensitizing certain tumors to IR. In human glioblastoma cells, exposure to gamma-irradiation stimulated release of IL-6 and IL-8 into culture supernatants (Pasi et al., Some concern had been raised about the effect of IR on the expression of the pleiotropic cytokine TNF. The majority of the studies points to an activatory action of IR. It has been shown previously that both, low (0.075 Gy) and high (2 Gy) doses of IR causes sustained stimulation of IL-12 and IL-18 secretion by mouse macrophages (Shan et al., Interestingly, RP105 (radioprotective 105 kDa), a TLR-related molecule, was recently identified on human B cells and DC (Fugier-Vivier et al., A promising approach in cancer therapy also might be targeting heat shock proteins (HSP), a class of proteins which are induced under physiologic stress to promote cell survival in the face of endogenous or exogenous injury. Screening of nearly 1,000 primary human tumor biopsies and the corresponding normal tissues revealed that human carcinomas, but none of the tested normal tissues, frequently present Hsp70 on their cell surface (Multhoff et al., Apart from their intracellular localization, Hightower and Guidon Jr. ( We recently observed an increased surface expression of Hsp70 in colorectal tumor cells after IR alone or in combination with hyperthermia (HT) while the amount of extracellular Hsp70 was only increased when HT was given additionally (Schildkopf et al., HSP over-expression in tumor cells plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis by inhibiting apoptosis and senescence. As discussed in this review, exposure to IR leads to activation of several transcription factors modulating the expression of numerous factors promoting cancer development.", "However, the effect of Rho-kinase (ROCK) on IR has not been definitely determined. Thus, the aims of the present study were to determine whether ROCK activation induces IR or affects myocardial structure and function, as well as the possible mechanisms underlying this process. The protein levels of MYPT-1 (characteristic of ROCK activation), IRS-1 and AKT were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. In hearts from MS rats, we found increased protein levels of phospho-MYPT-1 and phospho-IRS-1 (Ser307) and decreased phospho-AKT compared to levels in normal rats. In conclusion, the results suggest that ROCK-mediated IR is involved in the development of myocardial impairments in MS rats and that this effect is mediated probably via the IRS-1/PI3-kinase/AKT pathway.", "In contrast to Spartan\u2019s UBZ domain, the UBZ of Rad18 is dispensable for PCNA ubiquitylation ( Our results also suggest that UV-induced PCNA ubiquitylation, like IR-induced H2AX phosphorylation ( In addition to enhancing PCNA ubiquitylation, Spartan may have other roles in the response to UV damage. On the following day, cells were irradiated with the indicated doses of UV or IR. Cell viability was measured using the fluorometric alamarBlue reagent (Invitrogen) 10 days after UV or IR irradiation. (B and C) Spartan knockdown cells are sensitive to UV, but not IR. U2OS cells transfected with control, Spartan, Rad18, or ATM siRNA were treated with the indicated doses of UV (B) or IR (C). ATM knockdown cells are hypersensitive to IR and serve as a positive control in (C). Cells stably expressing SFB-Spartan were treated with 2 Gy IR and analyzed with the indicated antibodies.", "We examined the influence of exercise (3 times/week) for 12 weeks on the levels of serum CRP, leptin, insulin, homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in all groups. There were significant correlations between HOMA-IR and the individual components of the metabolic syndrome. Assess the relationship between HOMA-IR and the metabolic syndrome parameters. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the correlations between HOMA-IR and the individual components of the metabolic syndrome. There were significant correlations between HOMA-IR and the individual components of the metabolic syndrome (Table Pearson Correlation Coefficients between HOMA-IR and the individual components of the metabolic syndrome HDL-C = high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; HOMA-IR = insulin resistance as assessed by homeostasis model. It is slightly lower than a previous study [ The relationship between obesity and CRP levels in the children is limited, especially among the children younger than 12 years of age [ In the present study the metabolic syndrome group had a greater TG and a lower HDL-C concentration similar to previous reports [ Several physiological mechanisms exist to explain the changes in CRP and IR with exercise. Improvements in IR have been observed in adults upon participation in exercise programs; however, similar studies in overweight and obese children are limited [ The most significant effects of exercise on metabolic syndrome parameters are observed in HDL-C. MS: Metabolic syndrome; CRP: C-reactive protein; TG: Triglycerides; HDL-C: High-density lipoprotein cholesterol; TC: Total cholesterol; LDL-C: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; HOMA-IR: Homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance.", "Drosophila has been a good model to study the effects of IR because DNA damage responses as well as underlying genes are conserved in this model, and because streamlined gene families make loss-of-function analyses feasible. Indeed, Drosophila is the only genetically tractable model for IR-induced, p53-independent apoptosis and for tissue regeneration and homeostasis after radiation damage. We report here the first analysis of IR-induced, genome-wide gene expression changes in wild type and p53 mutant Drosophila larvae. The results solidify the central role of p53 in IR-induced transcriptome changes, but also show that nearly all changes are made of both p53-dependent and p53-independent components. p53 is found to be necessary not just for the induction of but also for the repression of transcript levels for many genes in response to IR. Furthermore, Functional analysis of one of the top-changing genes, EF1a-100E, implicates it in repression of IR-induced p53-independent apoptosis. These and other results support the emerging notion that there is not a single dominant mechanism but that both positive and negative inputs collaborate to induce p53-independent apoptosis in response to IR in Drosophila larvae. Second, all genes that show significant and reproducible induction or repression (\u00b11.5-fold or greater, p<0.005) between ANY \u00b1IR sample pairs at 2 or 18 hr, in To identify genes for further analysis, we applied a more stringent cut-off (\u22652-fold, p<0.001). Our findings extend to the larvae a conclusion based on gene expression analysis in embryo, that p53 is the major regulator of IR-induced changes in the transcriptome. The number of genes affected by IR in p53 mutants was less than one fifth of what is seen in A new theme that emerged from our data is that induction of apoptosis accompanies changes not only in pro-apoptosis genes but also in anti-apoptosis genes. For example, E2F2 was found previously to inhibit p53-independent apoptosis During normal cell cycle progression, E2F1 activates and E2F2 represses genes encoding essential replication factors at the G1/S boundary, in preparation for DNA synthesis Eiger, a ligand that activates of JNK signaling, is dispensable for p53-dependent apoptosis EF1\u2013a100E is induced by IR but only in p53 mutants at 18 hr post irradiation. First, irradiation is known to change the profile of mRNAs on the ribosome in mammalian cells In summary, we propose that the role of p53 in inducing apoptosis after IR exposure is not only through transcriptional activation of pro-apoptotic genes such as Flies were raised under standard conditions at 25\u00b0C.", "Efforts to ameliorate IR injury have been hindered in absence of adequate pre-clinical models. The goal of the present study was to develop a simple, efficient, and cost-effective means of studying hepatic IR injury. Accentuated damage to a hypoxic organ upon its reperfusion is a ubiquitous phenomenon encountered in a variety of clinical settings Most evidence for the underlying molecular mechanisms of hepatic IR has been obtained through whole animal, While hepatocyte isolation has yielded successful In 1968 Wicks and colleges published a sentinel paper describing hepatic organ culture The goal of the present study was to adapt the technique of hepatic organ culture in order to develop an The study was conducted with approval from the Animal Studies Committee (ASC) at Washington University in Saint Louis. Differences between groups were compared using Relative to the periphery, greater histologic injury was seen toward the center of liver cubes subjected to H&E staining of liver cubes at 6 hours following IR injury revealed extensive vacuolar degeneration in experimental cubes ( Following 24 hours in culture, experimental liver cubes underwent 60 minutes of hypoxia whereas controls remained normoxic. At 12 hours rediffusion, the level of TNF-\u03b1 was significantly higher in the media of experimental cubes compared to controls (11.78 \u00b1 1.21 pg/m Progress towards ameliorating the clinical effects of IR depends upon the adequacy of pre-clinical models. Both activated caspase-3 and TUNEL stain with greater intensity toward the periphery of liver cubes subjected to IR.", "With increasing reports on the role of vitamin D on elements of diabetes and metabolic syndrome such as adiposity, glucose homeostasis, lipid profiles and blood pressure, further investigation for evidence is greatly encouraged ( While longitudinal studies and intervention trials have shown inconsistent results for the association between vitamin D and IR or MS, numerous cross-sectional studies have demonstrated in favor of the relationship. In a national level prospective cohort study of 35,671 subjects followed in Korea from 2004 to 2006, significant increasing trend for MS was observed with increasing age ( The purpose of our study was to investigate the relationship of serum OHVD levels with IR and MS in elderly Koreans by repeated measures up to 3 times. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Seoul National University Hospital (IRB No. Characteristics of study subjects across quartiles of OHVD levels on all three visits are described in Numbers and their percentages of subjects for abnormal categories of components for metabolic syndrome across quartiles of serum OHVD levels are shown in Effects of serum OHVD levels on continuous variables (BMI, TG, HDL cholesterol, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, SBP, and DBP) across differently adjusted models were analyzed by mixed model analysis, and are shown in Effects of OHVD levels on categorical variables of MS components across differently adjusted models were analyzed by generalized estimating equations. Our results showed statistically significant inverse association of OHVD levels with IR, TG and blood pressure. The Troms\u00f8 study in Norway showed significant increase in total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels and decrease in serum TG levels across increasing serum OHVD quartiles in cross-sectional study, but significant association was found with serum TG levels only in longitudinal study ( Our results on OHVD levels and insulin or HOMA-IR showed clear inverse relationship, and conforms with previous studies that used HOMA-IR as a marker to indicate IR. In a meta-analysis including 4 prospective studies and 14 cross-sectional studies, the odds ratio for a 16 ng/mL or 39.94 nM (2 SD) increment in serum OHVD level was 0.84 (95% CI 0.78-0.90) ( Relationship between OHVD levels and insulin, HOMA-IR, SBP, DBP as continuous variables in our study showed statistical significance, but relationship between OHVD levels and 'hypertensive', 'diabetic' categories of MS did not. Because another Korean study suggested that the relationship between vitamin D and the risk of hypertension might be associated with a low habitual calcium intake and a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Korea ( To our knowledge, this is the first study that has performed a repeated measure analysis in investigating the effect of OHVD levels on IR and MS. However, effects of PTH levels on IR or MS still remains a controversy as the previous results have been inconsistent.

IR decreased primary neurosphere formation by 28%, but did not reduce secondary neurosphere formation. In contrast, LY364947 prior to IR decreased primary neurosphere formation by 75% and secondary neurosphere formation by 68%. To test this, we exposed GL261 neurospheres to 3 daily fractions of 2 Gy with or without LY364947 and performed comet assays to evaluate unresolved DNA damage at 24 hr after the final dose ( Our prior studies showed that To test the idea that TGF\u03b2 inhibition affects GIC self-renewal following IR, we examined CXCR4 and Notch1, which have been implicated in GIC self-renewal pathways ( GBM is a cancer characterized by a high degree of radioresistance, evidenced by inevitable local and/or disseminated recurrence. First, we use both a small molecule inhibitor of TGF\u03b2 type I receptor kinase, LY364947, as well as a pan-specific TGF\u03b2 neutralizing antibody, 1D11, to target the TGF\u03b2 pathway in combination with IR.", "In stark contrast, a separate FRAP study revealed that >80% of GFP-tagged mouse 53BP1 displayed a dramatically slower dynamic exchange (complete turnover in >1500s) at IR-induced nuclear foci (). These data suggest the possibility that DDR proteins display different mobility at artificial nuclear strips of DSBs than at near-physiological IR-induced nuclear foci. We found that MDC1 and 53BP1 have extremely different kinetics and levels of retention at foci, with contrasting dynamic responses to IR-induced DNA damage. The ectopic proteins resembled the endogenous MDC1 and 53BP1 proteins by forming an increased number of foci after IR treatment (). Here we compared the dynamics of these proteins specifically at nuclear foci formed after IR-induced DNA damage. We found that MDC1 moved more slowly with a reduced rate of exchange at IR-induced foci compared to the nuclear bodies of undamaged cells (D and E, gray arrows in graphs), indicated by a \u223c2.5-fold increase in of the slow mobile species (, IR-damaged cells). However, the final equilibrium remained unchanged indicating that \u223c80% of MDC1 is consistently mobile (or \u223c20% of MDC1 is stably retained) both at nuclear bodies and at IR-induced foci. Intriguingly, the kinetic parameters of MDC1 at IR-induced foci (\u223c80% mobile fraction, two-phase kinetics, up to 115s; see , IR-damaged cells) differ considerably to that previously reported at UV laser-induced nuclear strips of DSBs (\u223c80% mobile fraction, one-phase kinetics, \u223c7s) (), implying that these two DNA damage-induced structures may not be biologically equivalent. Unlike MDC1, 53BP1 was more dynamic in its exchange at foci following DNA damage, and its mobile fraction increased from \u223c35% to \u223c55% (D and E, black arrows in graphs) with a similar of up to 176s (, IR-damaged cells). This information is quite consistent with a previous FRAP analysis of mouse 53BP1 which displayed a similar recovery of \u223c60% within the same time frame (500s) after photobleaching of individual IR-induced foci, though it took longer (1500s) to reach a final plateau of \u223c85% (). In summary, we identified that MDC1 reduces its turnover rate at foci upon IR, whereas 53BP1 increases its proportion of mobile molecules under the same condition (F). We then used our inducible cell lines to express YFP-tagged MDC1 and 53BP1, and measured the fluorescence intensities of individual nuclear bodies in undamaged cells and nuclear foci in IR-damaged cells (C). Despite dramatic differences in dynamics, MDC1 and 53BP1 were present in similar quantities with an average total of \u223c1200 molecules per individual structure, whether it is a nuclear body or IR-induced focus. These results, when combined with the percentages of mobile/immobile fractions of the two proteins at different foci (), suggest that IR-induced DNA damage has little effect on the ratio of mobile/immobile MDC1 molecules, but stimulates the expansion of the 53BP1 mobile pool possibly to facilitate DNA repair (D, black arrow). To address this, we examined the impact of MDC1 knockdown on the actual number of 53BP1 molecules at IR-induced foci. We then used the VLP-based assay to compare the quantity of 53BP1 molecules at IR-induced foci in cells with normal MDC1 expression (control siRNA) or in the absence of MDC1 (MDC1 siRNA). Following the identification of a subset of MDC1-dependent 53BP1, we investigated whether MDC1 plays a role in regulating the mobility or retention of 53BP1 at IR-induced foci. These responses are in remarkable agreement with the effect of MDC1 knockdown (A and B; ), leading us to conclude that only a subset of 53BP1 is immobilized by MDC1 through direct association at IR-induced foci. To examine whether this minimal foci-targeting region resembles wild-type 53BP1 in dynamic turnover at IR-induced foci, we established an MCF-7-based inducible cell line expressing YFP-tagged 53BP1(1231\u20131709) () for FRAP and iFRAP analyses. Our photobleaching experiments in living cells found that the majority of MDC1 was highly dynamic at both nuclear bodies and IR-induced foci. Using live cell FRAP and iFRAP analyses performed over a 500s time interval, we showed that \u223c80% of MDC1 is under constant turnover with only \u223c20% present as a stable immobile pool at individual nuclear bodies and IR-induced foci. A detailed quantification of fluorescence intensities revealed a positive impact of MDC1 knockdown, or compromised MDC1-53BP1 binding, on 53BP1 copy number at IR-induced foci, providing evidence that MDC1 acts as an upstream regulator and contributes to recruitment of \u223c60% of 53BP1 molecules at individual DNA repair foci (F). This idea is quite consistent with our results highlighting major differences in the exchange rates and retention of MDC1 and 53BP1 at IR-induced foci. We recently used detailed cell imaging studies to show that 53BP1-positive foci are distinguishable from BRCA1-positive foci in IR-damaged cells (). A defining observation of this current study is the identification of a relatively small mobile pool (\u223c55%) of 53BP1 at mature IR-induced foci, which contrasts with a previous analysis of 53BP1 dynamics that reported a \u223c100% mobile fraction of 53BP1 at UV laser-induced nuclear strips of DSBs (). This is also notably different to several other YFP-tagged DDR proteins including BARD1 (), BRCA1, Abraxas and RAP80 () which are significantly more dynamic with a similar mobile fraction (\u223c80%) to that of MDC1 at IR-induced foci.", "showed that mice lacking IR in CNS exhibit significantly more severe impairment of peripheral glucose homeostasis than mice lacking IR in the peripheral tissues [ Aging-associated increase in central and peripheral insulin resistance could contribute to both diabetes and AD.

This study focuses on the potential role of leukotrienes (LTs) in obesity-associated inflammation and IR. We also studied the role of LTs in AT infiltration with macrophages and T cells, and the subsequent development of IR, in mice deficient for 5-LO or treated with its inhibitor Zileuton. To investigate the in vivo role of LTs in obesity-associated inflammation and IR, we used LT-deficient 5-LO Body and tissue weights and serum characteristics of animals studied Metabolic analyses of HFD-fed mice deficient for 5-LO or treated with the 5-LO inhibitor Zileuton. Body weights during metabolic tests Similarly, HFD-fed mice that were already IR regained insulin sensitivity after 2 weeks of daily treatment with the 5-LO inhibitor Zileuton, as measured by ITTs and GTTs ( Next, we quantified macrophages and T cells in AT from HFD-fed 5-LO ATM and T-cell quantification in HFD-fed mice deficient for 5-LO or treated with the 5-LO inhibitor Zileuton.", "Fenofibrate, indicated for hypertriglyceridemia, simultaneously reduces IR and shifts in lipoprotein diameter. Recent research indicates that the subfraction distribution within each fraction may be more informative in understanding lipoprotein metabolism and its associations with disease risk than traditional lipid measures [ Increases in the number of small LDL and HDL particles are associated with the development of IR and atherosclerosis [ There is, however, a significant interindividual variation in the response to fenofibrate across a range of lipid phenotypes [ GOLDN is part of the PROgram for GENetic Interaction Network, a group of family intervention studies focusing on gene\u2013environment interactions.", "IR can directly damage the atomic structures of nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. Both the direct and indirect effects of IR initiate a series of downstream signaling events that result in either the repair of damaged macromolecules or evolve toward some form of cell death. In tumor cells, the most biologically sensitive and clinically relevant macromolecule influencing cell death is DNA, which is susceptible to single-strand breaks (SSBs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Giusti et al., After radiation exposure, tumor cells undergo different types of tumor cell death, including: apoptosis, necrosis, mitotic catastrophe (MC), autophagy, and senescence (Gudkov and Komarova, The classical pathways of IR-induced cell death well described Evidence in experimental models suggests that radiation-induced promotion of anti-tumor immune responses can explain these abscopal effects (Chakravarty et al., Apoptosis is a highly regulated mechanism of programmed cell death that plays a fundamental role in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis to eliminate unwanted, damaged, or abnormal cells. Genes involved in apoptosis may act in concert or show redundancy (Kuribayashi et al., Depending on dose and cell type, RT may cause apoptosis via the membrane stress pathway (ceramide production and subsequent second messenger signaling), the intrinsic pathway (mitochondrial release of cytochrome and subsequent apoptosome formation), and the extrinsic pathway (death receptor mediated caspase activation) (Figure IR-induced apoptosis through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is mediated by DNA SSBs and DSBs (Gudkov and Komarova, The accumulation of p53 is critical to IR-induced apoptosis. In the cytoplasm, p53 is associated with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-X Bax induces permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane to trigger cell death through the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (Marzo et al., In addition to the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, IR is also involved in the canonical extrinsic apoptotic pathway. IR activation of p53, results in downstream transactivation of CD95/Fas, KILLER/DR5, and the CD95/Fas ligand (CD178) (Sheard, Strategies aimed at augmenting apoptosis constitute a common research area in oncology. However, p53 is mutated in ~50% of cancers and the apoptotic machinery is defective in most others, influencing responses to IR. In fact, tumors that are susceptible to p53 dependent apoptosis are quite radiosensitive, whereas, tumors that overexpress antiapoptotic proteins (BCL2, Bcl-X In cancers with p53 mutations, unchecked cell proliferation occurs in spite of DNA damage by IR. Cells display the morphological features of organelle swelling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and plasma membrane permeabilization with subsequent loss of intracellular contents, including immune stimulating \u201cdanger signals\u201d (Galluzzi and Kroemer, IR-induced necrosis in tumor cells is not to be confused with the indirect effects of IR occurring as untoward toxic effects in the clinic, like delayed osteoradionecrosis or central nervous system (CNS) radiation necrosis after high dose IR exposure of normal bone or brain tissue, respectively (Chrcanovic et al., Recent literature suggests that IR can directly induce regulated tumor cell necrosis (Nehs et al., RIP1 is a key upstream kinase involved in the activation of necroptosis (Degterev et al., Recent work by Nehs et al. demonstrated that necroptosis contributed to IR-induced cell death of anaplastic thyroid and adrenocortical cancers (Nehs et al., MC occurs after failed mitosis. MC acts as an oncosuppresive mechanism for the avoidance of genomic instability (Vitale et al., Mutant p53 tumor cells are susceptible to IR-induced MC (Ianzini et al., Interestingly, MC is associated with delayed apoptosis in irradiated tumor cells. This effect is paralleled by p53 suppression of cyclin B1 expression during IR-induced G2 cell cycle arrest. As expected, inactivation of DNA damage checkpoint kinases prevents senescence and restores cell cycle progression (Fagagna et al., The telomere also plays a crucial role in IR-induced senescence of cancer cells (Crompton, Senescent cells have a distinct secretory repertoire called senescence associated secretory phenotype or SASP (Coppe et al., Autophagy is characterized by the segregation of damaged or unwanted ER and cytoplasmic constituents into autophagosomes, destined for lysosomal degradation. Autophagy is noted for its role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in tumor cells undergoing chronic hypoxia and nutrient depletion (Bursch et al., While IR has been shown to induce autophagy in tumor cells, the literature is conflicting, regarding whether IR-induced autophagy promotes cell survival or cell death (Paglin et al., Specifically, the upstream molecular machinery involved in IR-induced autophagy remains unclear (Li et al., Upon initiation of autophagy, the phagophore (a nidus for membrane production) is generated either Several key proteins regulate autophagy. Reduced HMGB1 binds to RAGE, induces Beclin dependent autophagy and promotes resistance to IR and chemotherapy in pancreatic and colon cancer cells (Tang et al., ATP release is yet another important ICD component. However, emerging clinical evidence has renewed interest in studying the mechanisms of IR-induced ICD. Several reports have shown that IR and chemotherapeutic agents induce \u201cdanger signals\u201d that may contribute to an immune-mediated response at the tumor site, thereby reverting the immunosuppressive microenvironment of established tumors (Ma et al., The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.", "Animal model studies show that interruption of immune cell-mediated inflammation by any one of several methods almost invariably results in the prevention or delay of obesity and/or IR. These seemingly contradictory results indicate that a more comprehensive understanding of human IR/T2D-associated immune cell function is needed to leverage animal studies into clinical treatments. The appreciation of IR/T2D as an inflammatory disease began about two decades ago with publication of \u2018outlier\u2019 work showing tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) promotes IR ( Inflammation in T2D occurs on multiple levels, as demonstrated by elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum and in important metabolic regulatory tissues such as liver and adipose tissue (AT). Numerous rodent model studies implicate inflammation in obesity and/or IR etiology by showing that inactivation of a pro-inflammatory modulator prevents IR. These studies include either naturally occurring mutant or experimental knockout mice, or antibody blocking approaches that target molecules such as Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) or TLR4 ( A minority of pro-inflammatory molecules, including TLR5 and IL-17, appear to prevent obesity and/or IR in the DIO model. In the case of TLR5, a TLR that is not expressed by lymphocytes or adipocytes ( New data indicate that immune cells also respond to the physiological changes that accompany obesity and IR; therefore, immune cells may influence ongoing T2D pathogenesis independent of roles they play in disease etiology. This relatively linear pathway to T2D is consistent with results from time course DIO mouse studies, although the rapid induction of IR in response to a lipid bolus in mice argues that non-linear pathways also exist ( Lymphocyte subsets are altered in obesity and generally skew towards pro-inflammatory phenotypes and functions, thus lymphocytes contribute to local (AT) as well as systemic inflammation in T2D. Independent analysis of tissue sections of human visceral AT revealed a lower FOXP3 (Treg):Tbet (Th1) ratio, indicative of a pro-inflammatory T-cell balance, is associated with BMI ( Although the finding of expanded Th1/Th17s and decreased Tregs in obese AT is consistent with current dogma, it does not necessarily nullify the findings of increased Tregs in AT (and blood) of morbidly obese individuals ( Human analyses implicating elevated Th1 and decreased Treg cells in IR mirror studies completed in DIO mice; however, studies on roles for Th17 cells have been less consistent across species. However, despite these shortcomings, the demonstration of decreased AT T-cell infiltration in response to T2D treatments (76,77, see below) is consistent with pro-inflammatory T cells supporting IR/T2D in mice or humans and justifies more systematic analyses. Perhaps the first study to indicate B cells play any role in obesity and IR was completed in New Zealand obese (NZO) mice, a strain naturally prone to obesity and IR. Unlike wildtype NZO, B-cell-null NZO males fail to develop IR. B-cell-null mice had less visceral AT, even upon high fat diet challenge ( Another mechanism proposed for antibody-mediated metabolic control is the prospect of auto-antibodies promoting IR/T2D. This seemingly heretical concept has been ignited by work demonstrating a limited T-cell repertoire in DIO mice ( Recent work on blood from phenotypic human T2D may explain some of the confusion concerning the autoimmune aspects of obesity/IR/T2D and initiate a better understanding of the so-called \u2018type 1.5 diabetes\u2019, also known as latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA)( Defining T2D as a true autoimmune/loss of self-tolerance disease would have substantial clinical impact, given the recent development and clinical trials of multiple autoimmune disease drugs. Importantly, IL-10 overexpression can prevent IR in the DIO model ( Our published work on B cells from blood of T2D patients support the more global possibility that lack of B-cell-produced IL-10 in T2D patients may compound elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine production from a variety of cell types. Pro-inflammatory IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3 promote human adipocyte IR and lipolysis and inhibit adipogenesis ( The first demonstrations of changes in innate immune cells in response to diet-induced AT expansion were completed almost a decade ago. These studies showed a positive association between macrophages and BMI in obese mice (prior to diet-associated insulin elevation) and in humans ( Although virtually everyone in the field of immunometabolism agrees that macrophages play major roles in IR development, the exact mechanism by which they are activated (including differential AT depot recruitment, Apart from precision in nomenclature that could be fully embraced only by the wordsmiths among us, the designation of F4/80 In addition to DCs as APCs, unique specializations of DCs also explain why understanding this cell type may be important for defining inflammation in obese AT. Macrophages, on the other hand, circulate as precursor monocytes, which can undergo long-term obesity/IR/T2D-associated changes, including enhanced ability to produce inflammatory cytokines in the absence of elevated anti-inflammatory cytokine production (Jagannathan-Bogdan, unpublished data). Furthermore, LPS alone had only a modest ability to support Th17 function in the absence of direct T-cell activation ( Although much of the work outlined above focuses on the role of one particular cell type in IR/T2D, it is obvious that the reality is more complex than the function of any one cell can explain. The overriding principle supported by currently available immunometabolism studies is that multiple immune cell subsets likely play key roles in each of the many pathways to IR and T2D. Mice used for metabolic studies are often rendered IR due to genetic manipulation, such as a gene knockout. Feeding generally continues for 12\u201316 weeks, although some investigators analyze outcomes after a year or more of high fat diet (HFD) ( Despite the shortcomings in mouse models of both obesity/IR and immunological responses outlined above, many of the immunological findings in the DIO model accurately recapitulate changes in blood immune system cells in long-term T2D patients as reported by our group and others ( Data from multiple studies in combination with our results indicate important relationships among immune cells that differ among lean/non-diabetic, obese, and T2D individuals. These data must be interpreted in the context established by murine DIO studies: immune cells can cause IR/T2D, and immune cells from healthy donors can also be significantly influenced by ongoing disease. Our working model describing these interactions is shown in In non-diabetic (ND) lean individuals, monocytes, T cells, and B cells secrete relatively low to undetectable levels of cytokines that insignificantly affect AT and vice versa in a non-pathogenic homeostasis ( The evidence from DIO mice clearly shows that almost any interruption in inflammation prevents obesity and/or IR, thus strongly supports the importance of inflammation in the etiology of metabolic disease. In contrast, most human immunometabolism studies to date have been snapshots from variably matched populations representing lean/IS, obese/IS, obese/IR, and/or T2D. However, one intrinsic characteristic of these human sample studies is a focus on disease pathogenesis, rather than on disease etiology that can be studied only as subjects transition from obese/IS to obese/IR/T2D. Part of the explanation for the lack of focus on halting the transition from obese/IS to obese/IR/T2D is the perceived \u2018danger\u2019 of immunomodulatory drugs, although some drugs, such as the B-cell depletion drug rituxan, have high safety profiles and do not result in general immunosuppression in adults ( In the end, the immunometabolism field must come to some conclusion as to the overarching goal of this newly defined research area. Overall pathogenic pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by immune cells promote AT IR (red double-headed arrow). Taken together, all of these factors promote IR and systemic inflammation in T2D. Treg expansion in morbidly obese individuals may curb, at least in part, inflammation-mediated metabolic imbalance/IR.", "However, it remains poorly understood whether IR induces apoptosis and what factors are involved in IR-induced apoptosis in skeletal muscle. Using a murine model of tourniquet-induced hindlimb IR, we investigated the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in skeletal muscle. Compared to sham treatment, tourniquet-induced IR significantly elevated mitochondria-derived superoxide production, activated opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), and caused apoptosis in the gastrocnemius muscles. Pretreatment with a superoxide dismutase mimetic (tempol, 50 mg/kg) or a mitochondrial antioxidant (co-enzyme Q Exsanguinating injury of the extremity is a major cause of battlefield deaths and an important cause of preventable trauma fatalities in civilian medicine The cell death secondary to IR is a mixture of cell necrosis and apoptosis LDH (lactate dehydrogenase, cytosolic protein maker) and COX IV (cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV, mitochondrial protein marker) were measured by Western blot analysis. Male C57BL6 mice (10\u201312 weeks of age, 27\u201334 g, n = 102, Charles River Laboratory) were housed under controlled temperature and humidity and a 12\u223612-h dark-light cycle, and were provided water and mouse chow Mice were assigned randomly to sham and tourniquet-induced IR groups. In sham and IR groups, mice were intraperitoneally administered vehicle, 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidinyloxy (tempol, a superoxide dismutase mimetic, Alexis Biochemicals Co., CA), cyclosporine A (CsA, an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore, Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO), or co-enzyme Q MitoTracker green: mitochondrial marker; MitoSOX red: mitochondrial superoxide marker. A, time-course for the changes of the absorbance at 540 nm in the isolated mitochondria of the gastrocnemius muscles from sham and tourniquet-induced IR groups. *P<0.05 vs. sham; At the end of sham or tourniquet-induced IR protocol (3 h ischemia and 4 h reperfusion), gastrocnemius muscle was immediately harvested and washed with a cold isolation buffer A (in mM): 70 sucrose, 210 mannitol, 1 EDTA, 50 Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). As shown in Superoxide-sensitive probe MitoSOX Red is thought to be a useful tool for measuring mitochondria-derived superoxide We also investigated the effects of tempol and CoQ Ca A significant increase of caspase 9 activity was found in IR gastrocnemius muscles compared to sham gastrocnemius muscles ( TUNEL staining was performed to identify apoptotic nuclei ( Our present study reports that tourniquet-induced IR (3 h ischemia and 4 h reperfusion) increases mitochondria-derived superoxide production, causes mPTP opening, and induces apoptosis in mouse gastrocnemius muscles. Although the mechanisms responsible for IR-induced apoptosis are still unclear, much evidence has demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction could play a central role in cell death leading to both necrosis and apoptosis in many tissues Mitochondria as the major source of superoxide have been found in the skeletal muscle There are several different types of cells in the skeletal muscles including skeletal myocytes, vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, infiltrated inflammatory cells, etc. For the isolation of mitochondria, we found that content of pure mitochondria in IR gastrocnemius muscles was lower than that in sham gastrocnemius muscles. One possibility is that mitochondria are broken by tissue homogenization and tourniquet-induced IR. Recently, connexin-43, a major gap junction protein is thought to be involved in preconditioning-induced cardioprotection In conclusion, mitochondria-derived superoxide is overproduced in skeletal muscle during tourniquet-induced IR. The elevation of mitochondria-derived superoxide contributes to IR-induced apoptosis in skeletal muscle through activating mPTP opening.", "Conversely, overexpression of TRIP12 or UBR5 degraded endogenous RNF168 (E), which was accompanied by suppression of IR-induced 53BP1 focus formation in a catalytic-dependent fashion (F). Thus, active TRIP12 and UBR5 E3 ligases are required to suppress excessive chromatin ubiquitylations at IR-induced DSBs. To test this, we used the TRIP12 and UBR5 knockdown as a molecular tool to maximally mobilize endogenous RNF168, exposed cells to increasing doses of IR (0.25\u20134 Gy), and quantified in hundreds of randomly chosen cells the magnitude of ubiquitin-dependent protein accumulations at damaged chromatin. Strikingly, naive U-2-OS cells and primary human fibroblasts responded to the increasing dose of IR by a progressive reduction of fluorescence intensity and areas of nuclear foci occupied by 53BP1 (A, A, and S6B). Although the sum of 53BP1 fluorescence associated with all IR-induced foci per nucleus increased up to 1\u20132 Gy (corresponding to 20\u201340 DSB), it began to decline at higher doses (B). Consistent with this conclusion, the absolute number of 53BP1 foci per nucleus increased only up to 1 Gy of IR (C). Most importantly, the combined TRIP12/UBR5 knockdown elevated the threshold to higher IR doses at all assay levels, including the intensity, area, and number of 53BP1-decorated nuclear foci, respectively (A, 5B, 5D, and B). Although TRIP12/UBR5 depletion did not generally affect IR-induced ATM autophosphorylation (B), it caused a marked reduction of KAP1 phosphorylation (A), and also, this effect appeared to be mediated by elevated RNF168 (A). In our experimental conditions, the dynamic range of chromatin ubiquitylation is saturated at IR doses that correspond to (maximally) 20\u201340 DSBs. A plasmid containing the full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) for human TRIP12 was obtained from Source BioScience (cloneIRCMp5012E0132D; transcript ENST 00000389044, Ensembl release 66) and was subcloned into the pAc-GFP-C1 vector (Clontech).", "The IR undergoes autophosphorylation after insulin binding, which initiates a signaling cascade initiated by tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (IRS), followed by phosphorylation of phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase (PI3K), phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), Akt, and protein kinase C (PKC). Studies by Tan and colleagues, in healthy non-diabetic subjects, showed an association between AGE levels, inflammatory markers and insulin resistance (the latter by the homeostatic model assessment index or HOMA-IR) Therapies that modulate generalized insulin resistance such as PPAR\u03b3 or PPAR\u03b1 agonists have been shown in animal models to improve myocardial function in part by decreasing circulating levels of fatty acids and switching myocardial substrate metabolism towards glucose The mechanisms for and consequences of insulin resistance in the heart are complex and multifactorial. ROS and products of incomplete oxidation impact signaling cascade such as PKC, JNK and IKK, as well as that of IRS-1 and downstream signaling mediators in the insulin signaling pathway, such as PI3 kinase, Akt and AS160, resulting in reduced GLUT4 translocation and consequently a decrease in glucose uptake in to the heart.", "Further, we found that ANXA1 knockdown sensitized cells to IR via a mechanism that was not potentiated by KU55933. To investigate the role of ATM kinase activity in spatial protein dynamics, both in the coordination of critical interactions and subsequent exchanges within DDR complexes, and in the movement of proteins between different cellular compartments, we combined stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based tandem mass spectrometry (MS) and a subcellular fractionation protocol to compare the proteome of cells treated with and without KU55933 for 1 h following IR. 10 Two populations of primary human lung fibroblasts (IMR90) were grown in either \u201clight\u201d media ( A total of 18,271 pairs of distinct light and heavy peptides were quantified ( Challenged by such a large proteomic data set, we sought to identify whole pathways that are reconfigured in cells treated with KU55933 following IR. To validate our MS, we fractionated IMR90 cells treated with or without KU55933 following IR and immunoblotted 53BP1, the chromatin fraction. We generated clonal populations of H460 cells in which ANXA1 is knocked down by an shRNA and clonal H460 control cells expressing a scrambled shRNA ( We combined SILAC MS/MS, a subcellular fractionation protocol, and network analyses to interrogate the dynamics of the cellular proteome that are dependent upon ATM kinase activity following IR. This observation appeared to conflict with our previous observation that neither the accumulation nor the resolution of 53BP1 in DDR complexes visualized in fixed cells were affected by ATM kinase inhibition for 1 h following IR. This model is consistent with our observations that ATM kinase inhibition for 1 h following IR increased persistent chromatid aberrations and increased cell death.

Although at 2 and 4 Gy, IR reduced the CFE of RAP80 Previous studies indicated that RAP80 facilitated the translocation of BRCA1 to IRIF ( Previously, we demonstrated that siRNA knockdown of RAP80 expression stabilizes p53 and results in increased transactivation of p53 target genes and increased apoptosis following DNA damage ( Regulation of cell-cycle checkpoints is an integral part of the DDR ( Premature senescence observed in MEFs deficient in H2AX, ATM or BRCA1 expression has been reported to be associated with chromosomal instability ( To further examine whether the loss of RAP80 expression resulted in genomic instability, we analyzed metaphase spreads prepared from RAP80 Mice deficient in several DDR proteins have been reported to exhibit an increased susceptibility to cancer development due to increased genomic instability ( Previous studies have shown that the loss of the tumor suppressor p53 greatly enhances tumor development in mice ( p53 We next compared the susceptibility of RAP80 Previous reports demonstrated that RAP80 plays an important role in DDR signaling.

IR was measured before and after the 14-day treatments using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique, and changes in IR were evaluated using the mean glucose disposal rate that was normalized to body weight (M BW ) and lipid metabolism.

Early studies determined that biguanides, including metformin, increased the phosphorylation and activation of AMPK, thereby protecting the heart against IR injury [ The cardioprotective effects of AMPK activation are associated with inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition pores (PTP) [ In this study, we examined whether simultaneous PTP inhibition and AMPK activation provided synergistic cardioprotection against Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250\u2013275 g, Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were housed in individual cages in a temperature controlled room under a regular light-dark cycle. As shown in Figures Overall, these results suggest that activation of AMPK and inhibition of PTP protect the heart during cardiac IR by reducing infarct size and improving cardiac function. We examined the effects of A-769662 and/or SfA on phosphorylation of AMPK and PPAR Overall, these results indicate that, unlike metformin, A-769662 does not phosphorylate AMPK at Thr In the next set of experiments, we evaluated the effects of A-769662, SfA, or the combination on mitROS production in cardiac IR. We measured H Analysis of enzymatic activity of ETC complexes demonstrated that cardiac IR reduced the activity of complexes I, III, and IV by 28%, 44%, and 50% ( Next, we measured citrate synthase activity as a marker of mitochondrial mass. Our results showed that IR reduced citrate synthase activity in mitochondria. Treatment with SfA, A-769662, or their combination did not prevent the effect of IR, suggesting that improvements observed with ETC complexes are not due to increased mitochondrial mass ( These results demonstrate that cardiac IR decreased the activity of ETC complexes I, II, III, and IV. Mitochondria isolated from mouse hearts expressing kinase-dead (KD) AMPK demonstrated increased hydrogen peroxide production and decreased resistance to PTP opening compared to WT counterparts [ Notably, PTP opening occurs at reperfusion, but not during ischemia, and reaches a maximum within 10\u201315 min of reperfusion [ Although we and others have established that the beneficial effects of AMPK activation against cardiac IR are mediated through PTP formation, the specific mechanisms associated with AMPK-induced inhibition of the PTP are still unclear.

The most likely mechanism is the promotion of IRS1 phosphorylation, which leads to insulin sensitivity restoration. In addition, the area under curve (AUC) of the glucose tolerance and insulin resistance index (IRI) was calculated using the following formula. The expression profiles for 19 IR-related proteins and 15 IR-non-related proteins were then subjected to clustering analysis using the ward algorithm in the absence of data standardization using JMP software tool (Research Triangle Park, NC).

As shown in To compare the effects of MLE and MLEF, the expression of proteins that were significantly differentially expressed is plotted in Validation of protein expression levels using Western blot analysis Western blot analysis of three proteins, namely, JNK, IRS1, and PDK1, was conducted, and the results are presented in (A) Relative expression levels of the three proteins in samples from model (M), MLE treatment (MLE), MLEF treatment (MLEF), and normal (N) animals; (B) Western blot analysis of the expression levels of JNK, IRS1 PDK1, and GAPDH in the same set of samples. Particularly, we have (1) tested the toxicity of MLE on mice; (2) tested the effects of MLE on fasting glucose levels in normal rats; (3) constructed an insulin resistance rat model; (4) tested the effects of MLE and MLEF on the rat model based on the measurement of levels of BG, cholesterol, and triglyceride and subsequently calculated the IRI; and (5) explored the potential molecular mechanism using an antibody microarray platform. By contrast, in IR model rats, the treatment with MLE (75 mg/kg BW) or MLEF (35 mg/kg), prior to and during high-energy-diet feeding and alloxan injection, significantly decreased the fasting BG levels. Trends of reduction on BG levels at the 0.5 h, 2 h, AUC of the tolerant test, cholesterol level, and IRI were also observed to be insignificant. Previous studies showed that IR can be induced by long-term excessive fat and/or carbohydrate feeding in animals [ The animal model used in the current study is established based on the method recommended by the China SFDA for the evaluation of health food products, which aims to help in the reduction of BG level. Insulin binding leads to phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, which includes insulin receptor substrates (IRS1, 2, 3, 4), SHC, GAB1, CBL, and other signaling intermediates [ In our present study, IRS1 is the most up-stream protein in the signal pathway, whose expression levels have been found to be significantly downregulated in the model animals and upregulated after MLE and MLEF treatment ( In summary, the data support the following model, (i) the treatment with high fat diet and alloxon injection inhibits IRS1 phosphorylation and activation. IRS1 activation is responsible for the stimulation of glucose transport and glycogen synthesis and inhibition of gluconeogenesis. As a result, the cells are not sensitive to insulin; (ii) treatment with MLE and MLEF upregulates the IRS1 phosphorylation to a level similar to that in the normal group.", "In radiosensitive ATM deficient cells, the defects in triggering the whole DDR following IR lead to checkpoint failure and to the accumulation of unresolved DSBs [ In order to determine a relationship between persistent radiation-induced DSBs and apoptosis, we had to first determine the ability to undergo apoptosis in AT and normal lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Indeed, at 48 hours pIR, the percentage of normal cells with \u226510 To further analyze this possibility, we proceeded to analyze radiation-induced DSBs in normal and AT lymphoblasts undergoing apoptosis. The characteristic DSB-signaling processes of the DDR, such as phosphorylation of histone H2AX forming visible foci, are eventually abolished in cells undergoing last stages of apoptosis, probably due to DNA condensation [ Within the above mentioned fraction of cells undergoing early apoptosis (An+/PI\u2212), most of them had It is important to note that An+/PI\u2212 cells might be considered viable, as early apoptosis is believed to be reversible if the conditions inducing apoptosis are removed [ Annexin-V/PI and TUNEL methodologies have been used to analyze IR-induced apoptosis. TUNEL detection on slides and subsequent microscope analysis allows the combination of TUNEL and protein immunodetection\u2014like The results in this work show that AT LCL efficiently undergoes IR-induced apoptosis to a higher level than its normal counterpart at all times analyzed. The frequency of cells entering in S-phase for each cell type and each time point is shown, evidencing lack of IR-induced G1 checkpoint arrest in AT cells.", "In most organisms homolog pairing relies on the formation of physiological DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) that are formed by the transesterase Spo11 during the leptonema substage of prophase I Meiotic homology search in many organisms is associated with chromosome movements in the presence of physiological DSBs Meiotic chromosome mobility is thought to support the chromosome pairing process in meiotic prophase and is generally driven by cytoskeletal forces, either by microtubules (mammals, worms and fission yeast) However, it is not known whether the IR- and ROS-induced stalling of meiotic chromosome movements in budding yeast relates to a protective mechanism that paralyzes chromosome mobility upon exposure to a genotoxic environment, or whether this effect solely relates to the sensitivity of the actin cytoskeleton to oxidative agents To study the consequences of IR exposure on meiotic chromosome mobility we followed nuclear and chromosome movements in X-irradiated and non-irradiated live To determine the reaction of meiotic fission yeast cells to the exposure with IR we irradiated sporulating cultures with increasing doses of 240 kV X rays. Cells were irradiated 2\u20133 h after transfer to sporulation medium when most cells are in the horsetail stage, sporulation rates were determined 20 h post IR in three independent experiments. To see whether this is the case for IR-induced DSBs in meiotic cells, we irradiated motile and Thiabendazole (TBZ)-paralyzed horsetail cells at concentrations that inhibit horsetail movements without affecting spore viability With the onset of first meiotic prophase Irradiation of horsetail-stage cells with increasing doses of X rays of Rec8-GFP and Tubulin-GFP still revealed the typical mobility of meiotic nuclei driven by astral MT oscillations as revealed by time lapse cinematography ( Controls with the MT-drug TBZ prior to irradiation reduced horsetail motility to an average of ~2 \u03bcm/min ( Because antioxidants can ameliorate radical effects on meiotic chromosome mobility Ionizing radiation creates radicals and reactive oxygen species that in budding yeast have been shown to reduce actin-dependent meiotic chromosome mobility Inducing ROS with increasing concentrations of H While elevated ROS levels have been noted to affect the microtubule cytoskeleton in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. To determine the amount of IR-induced DSBs in meiotic fission yeast cells, we stained DSBs with a modified 3\u2032-end labelling protocol that reveals IR-induced DSBs in meiotic cells but fails to detect physiological meiotic DSBs The obtained yield of IR-induced DSB foci is somewhat below the 0.15 DSB/Gy expected in G Using 3\u2019-end labelling, we noted a different DSB dose response of meiotic budding yeast cells compared to fission yeast cells, the former displaying 0.2 DSB foci/Gy Next we determined homologous chromosome pairing at two different LacO/LacI-tagged loci. Five hours post IR 76% of exposed cells were still in prophase I, as identified by horsetail morphology and Rec8-GFP expression, while in the control only 53% of cells were still in prophase I ( IR-induced misrepair of DSBs generates dicentric chromosomes (carrying two centromeres), and acentric fragment(s) that are also seen after failure of DSBs repair. Indeed we observed anaphase bridges and chromosome fragments in irradiated cells ( Meiotic chromosome movements in budding yeast meiosis depend on actin polymerization When we investigated the actin cytoskeleton in control and irradiated horsetail cells by TRITC-Phalloidin staining we noted the expected actin patches in control prophase cells ( Overall, these data suggest that IR exposure leads to formation of ROS that disturb the actin cytoskeleton that is important for spore formation. It appeared that absence of meiotic chromosome mobility did not improve the IR-induced reduction of sporulation or spore viability, indicating that chromosome mobility is not regulating the repair of (IR-induced) DSBs in prophase I of It is known that one or two DSBs that remain unrepaired can kill a G1 yeast cell In all, it appears that the chromosome movement system of fission yeast is relatively insensitive to DSB formation, since most irradiated cells still performed robust movements in the presence of more than 20 IR-induced DSBs, which are only a fraction of the about 50\u201380 physiological DSBs per recombination-proficient In budding yeast meiotic chromosome mobility has been observed to be particularly vulnerable to IR exposure with mobility stalling in pachytene cells exposed to more than 40 Gy While ROS affected MT- and actin-driven nuclear mobility to different extent, an additional protection against ROS could be achieved by pretreatment with the antioxidant NAC that improved horsetail speed approx. Antioxidant treatment was done as described previously for budding yeast using N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC; Sigma-Aldrich) The actin cytoskeleton was stained with phalloidin-TRITC (Sigma-Aldrich) as described IR-induced DSBs were detected with a modified 3\u2032end-labelling assay as described ROS were detected in yeast cells with the ROS-specific probe dihydroethidium (DHE; Molecular Probes), a free radical sensor that in its reduced form exhibits blue fluorescence in the cytosol as described Live cell imaging was done using our 4D live cell microscope system (TILL [now FEI]) as described in detail elsewhere For volume determination live cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (0.5 \u03bcg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) in distilled water for 10 min at RT. ( Without IR exposure (0 Gy; recording time 4 min) horsetail nuclei perform long continuous movements.", "Activation of the IGF pathway, by binding of the growth factors IGF-I and IGF-II to the receptors IGF-IR and IR, respectively, triggers complex signaling cascades that regulate cell growth, survival, proliferation, and differentiation in developmental stages [ HGF is secreted by mesenchymal cells and stimulates epithelial cell proliferation, motility, scattering, morphogenesis and angiogenesis via phosphorylation of HGFR receptor, also known as c-Met or simply MET.", "However, exposure to IR doses above 8 Gy results in gastro-intestinal (GI) syndrome characterised by denudated villi, apoptosis of crypt cells and elevated inflammatory responses. Multiple strategies have been employed to investigate novel agents to protect against IR induced injury. Since cellular redox homeostasis plays a pivotal role in deciding the cell fate, present study was undertaken to explore the potential of 1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ), a pro-oxidant, to ameliorate IR induced GI syndrome. NQ protected INT 407 cells against IR induced cell death of intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. Further, knocking down Nrf2 rescind the NQ mediated protection against IR induced cell death. In conclusion, NQ protects against IR radiation induced GI syndrome in vitro by perturbing cellular redox and activating Nrf2 pathway. This is the first report highlighting the potential of a pro-oxidant to ameliorate IR induced GI injury.", "The results for AMPK or pAMPK protein levels were consistent with the results of Western blot analysis ( In the pancreas ( In gastrocnemius muscle ( In the epididymal adipose tissue ( In this study, we found: (1) higher sugar level at 15 and 30 min in the DHF group than in the VHF group; (2) the serum insulin level at 15, 30 and 60 min were significantly higher in the DHF group than in the VSD group; (3) lower liver IR and AMPK mRNA and protein in the DHF group than the other three groups; and (4) lower IR and IRS-1 mRNA expression in the epididymal adipose tissue in the VHF and DHF groups than the other two groups. IGF-1 gene expression was reported to be downregulated in liver tissues and progressively decreased with the severity and duration of diabetic state [ Additionally, we found IR and AMPK mRNA levels were both decreased in the livers of the DHF group compared to that in the other groups. In gastrocnemius muscle, IR mRNA expression was decreased in the DSD, VHF, and DHF groups compared to that in the VSD group. In the epididymal adipose tissue, we observed decreased IR and IRS-1 mRNA expression in the VHF and DHF groups. In both the muscle and adipocytes, binding of insulin to its receptor, insulin receptor phosphorylation and activation of tyrosine kinase, and IRSs phosphorylation are reduced. In adipocytes isolated from obese humans with type 2 diabetes, expression of IRS-1 is reduced, followed by IRS-1\u2013associated PI3K activity decreased, then IRS-2 becomes the main docking protein for PI3K [ This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (number 2014032607, approved date 2014/05/05).", "IR was performed for 45 minutes after the drugs' applications. While serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) of the IR group were significantly higher than those of the TQ plus \u03b1-TP, TQ and \u03b1-TP groups (p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.008, respectively) and IL-6 (all p<0.001), the reduced glutathione (GSH) level of the IR group was lower than that of the other three groups. While neuronal nitric oxide synthase activity of nerve tissues of the IR group was significantly lower than that of the TQ plus \u03b1-TP group, the muscle tissue caspase-3 activity was higher than that of the TQ plus \u03b1-TP group. Administration of TQ plus \u03b1-TP may strongly protect muscle and nerve tissues against IR injury via their synergistic effects.", "The adipose tissue insulin resistance index (calculated as the product of fasting insulin and FFA concentrations) (Adipose IR) and the area under curve of FFAs during the OGTT were compared between glucose tolerance categories. Adipose IR significantly increased across glucose tolerance categories (P for trend < .001). Within the normal glucose tolerance participants, an increase in adipose IR was observed related to an increase in 2-hr glucose levels. In a subsample of participants who underwent abdominal imaging for determination of lipid partitioning (n = 115), a tight relation of visceral fat (r = 0.34; P < .001) and the visceral/sc fat ratio (r = 0.55; P < .001) with the Adipose IR index was evident. Glucose tolerance category, degree of obesity (body mass index-z score), IL-6, and low adiponectin emerged as significant predictors of the Adipose IR. Adipose IR is associated with reduced suppression of FFAs during the OGTT and with an altered adipocytokine profile.", "The main purpose of this paper is to study the protective effect of PPs on peripheral blood, liver and spleen injuries in mice induced by IR.

[ The decrease observed in NAp Electron Microscopy, DNA laddering, flow cytometry, TUNEL assay, Although the same sample size was used in some similar papers,[ From the delineated data in this study, it could be concluded that IR could induce apoptosis in human peripheral blood leukocytes through the formation of free radicals leading to cellular damage.", "On the basis of these observations, we designed a strategy to prevent DNA damage repair in BC cells using a hypomethylating therapy (HMT; An increase in total H4K20me2 levels was found using western blot analysis after IR; however, it was only observed at high doses of radiation. Hypomethylating conditions are thought to inhibit cellular SAM-dependent methylases, and no specificity was demonstrated in the HMT after H3K79me2 levels were evaluated in BC cells ( Because the functions of BRCA1 have been shown to be controlled by protein methylation, Cells exposed to IR subsequently arrest in various phases of the cell cycle to repair damaged DNA, and, depending on the extent of the damage, such cells can either enter mitosis or die via apoptosis. Other BC cell lines harboring p53 mutations, such as MDA-MB-231 and 4T1, are highly resistant to both apoptosis and the induction of senescence after IR. Here, we observed that this HMT impedes the recruitment of 53BP1 and BRCA to the chromatin regions flanking DSBs, thereby inhibiting DDR signals in BC cells treated with IR. Although inhibition of H4K20 and H3K79 dimethylation clearly explains the decrease observed in IR damage-induced focus formation in 53BP1, The identification and characterization of CICs enriched in stem cell-like functions and the establishment of a link between CICs and therapy resistance have been main focuses of cancer research in recent years. ( The HMT impeded DNA damage repair and sensitized BC cells to IR-induced apoptosis.", "The present study aimed to investigate the possible cardioprotective effects of p-nitro caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE-NO 2 ) on myocardial IR-induced injury in vivo . To generate a rat model of myocardial IR, the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 30 min, followed by reperfusion for 2 h. The rats were administered either the sham treatment (the sham and IR control groups) or the therapeutic agents [the caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and CAPE-NO 2 groups] 10 min prior to the occlusion. Myocardial IR-induced injury is characterized by: A significant increase in the levels of myocardial enzymes, including creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate transaminase; a marked increase in intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression levels, lipid peroxidation products and inflammatory mediators; and a significant decrease in myocardial antioxidants, including catalase, total superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. In the present study, pretreatment with CAPE-NO 2 significantly ameliorated these changes, and decreased the infarct size, as compared with the IR control group (10.32\u00b13.8 vs. 35.65\u00b15.4%). Furthermore, western blotting demonstrated that pretreatment with CAPE-NO 2 downregulated the myocardial IR-induced protein expression levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax), cleaved caspase-3, P38 and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. CAPE-NO 2 also upregulated the myocardial IR-induced expression levels of Bcl-2, phosphoinositide-3-kinase, phosphorylated Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin.", "Here, we report that IR induced caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation and subsequent apoptosis only in p21-deficient colon carcinoma cells, whereas similar treated wild-type cells were permanently arrested in the G(2)-M phase, correlating with the induction of cellular senescence. Interestingly, activation of the mitochondrial pathway, including caspase-2 processing, depolarization of the outer mitochondrial membrane, and cytochrome c release, was achieved by IR in both cell lines, indicating that p21 inhibits an event downstream of mitochondria but preceding caspase-9 activation. IR-induced p21 protein expression was restricted to the nucleus, and no evidence for a mitochondrial or cytoplasmic association was found. Consistent with this assumption, we found that CDK inhibitors potently abrogated IR-induced caspase processing and activation without affecting mitochondrial events. Thus, our results strongly indicate that p21 protects cells from IR-induced apoptosis by suppression of CDK activity that seems to be required for activation of the caspase cascade downstream of the mitochondria.", "The differences in the response to IR-induced DNA damage and increased reactive oxygen species between normal human fibroblasts (NHFs) and cancerous SHSY-5Y cells were considered. In addition, NHF cells appeared to quench the oxidative stress induced by IR, and after 24 h no DNA damage was present. These results indicate that there is a differential response between this cancerous and normal cell line in their ability to respond to low-dose IR, and these differences need to be exploited in order to treat cancer effectively. Further study is needed in order to elucidate the mechanism by which SHSY-5Y cells undergo apoptosis following radiation and why these normal cells are better equipped to deal with IR-induced double-strand breaks and oxidative stress.", "The replication of telomelysin is controlled by the human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter and has been shown to be effective in sensitizing cells to IR ( Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenol that is present in more than 72 plant species. KU59403 increased the cytotoxicity of the topoisomerase I and II poisons camptothecin, etoposide, and doxorubicin, It should be noted that CGK-733, a small molecule that was initially reported to inhibit both ATM and ATR kinase activities and block checkpoint signaling with great selectivity, was later retracted ( Human single-stranded binding protein 1 is required for the activation of ATM through the recruitment of the MRN complex to the break site ( The checkpoint kinases, Chk1 and Chk2, are critical for cell cycle activation following the induction of DSBs and serve to maintain the genomic integrity of cells ( Of these checkpoint kinases, Chk1 is critical for the induction of HR, as inhibition of Chk1 UCN-01, a staurosporine inhibitor was the first inhibitor identified for both Chk1 and Chk2 and treatment with this compound lead to G2/M checkpoint deficiencies in IR-treated p53-deficient tumor cells ( XL-844, also known as EXEL-9844, is a potent, ATP-competitive inhibitor of Chk1 and Chk2.

We demonstrated that O1 and O3 subjects with IR showed higher oxidative damage to their plasma lipids and proteins than NW subjects. Our study revealed an association between the presence of carbonyl stress, IR, and insulin polymer formation in obese subjects.", "", "Downregulation of miR-21 in radioresistant NSCLC A549 cells inhibited the colony-forming ability and proliferation of A549 cells after IR. Moreover, silencing miR-21 enhanced apoptosis of A549 cells induced by IR accompanied by decreased phosphorylated-Akt protein level. However, PI3K activator IGF-1 reversed suppression of phosphorylated-Akt protein level and promotion of apoptosis of A549 cells after IR caused by miR-21 knockdown. Silencing miR-21 in radioresistant NSCLC A549 cells sensitized them to IR by inhibiting cell proliferation and enhancing cell apoptosis through inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. PCR-based detection of miR-21 was performed by the TaqMan miRNA assays (ABI, Forest City, CA) as described previously [ 48 h after anti-miR-21 or anti-miR-NC transfection, subconfluent cell monolayers were treated with After exposure to various doses of IR, cells were trypsinized, washed, and replated at 200 cells per 10-cm dishes. Twenty-four hours before IR, 200 Attached cells were harvested at 48 h after IR for apoptosis detection using the annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (Sigma, Louis, MO). Compared with anti-miR-NC-transfected A549 cells, the level of miR-21 expression in anti-miR-21-transfected cells was significantly decreased by about 64% ( To assess whether miR-21 downregulation could sensitize NSCLC A549 cells to IR, the A549 cells transfected with either anti-miR-NC or anti-miR-21 were irradiated and their response was analysed. In clonogenic survival analysis, we observed the expected decreased survival capacity of A549 cells transfected with anti-miR-21 14 days after IR ( To confirm the increased IR sensitivity of A549 cells, the effect of miR-21 on cell proliferation was further analysed at 72 h after IR ( We next explored the role of miR-21 in the apoptosis of NSCLC A549 cells induced by IR. Anti-miR-21 or anti-miR-NC was transfected into A549 cells and was exposed (or sham exposed) to 8 Gy of IR. As shown in Because the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is associated with apoptosis, we subsequently examined the potential effects of miR-21 on the activation of PI3K/Akt pathways by IR to explore the potential molecular mechanisms. By Western blot, we found that the endogenous level of phospho-Akt expression (Ser473) in anti-miR-21-transfected A549 cells was downregulated compared to that in anti-miR-NC-transfected A549 cells after IR ( To further confirm the molecular mechanisms of radiosensitization by miR-21 knockdown in NSCLC A549 cells, we next treated the cells with or without PI3K activator IGF-1 and then examined the effects of miR-21 downregulation on cell apoptosis induced by IR. Among them, miR-21 is reported to play a role in radioresistance of cancer, including glioblastoma [ Our data showed that, following the transfection of anti-miR-21 into A549 cells, the inhibition of survival fraction caused by various doses of IR was enhanced compared with radiotherapy alone. This result suggests that miR-21 is closely associated with the therapeutic efficiency of IR on radioresistant A549 cells and downregulation of miR-21 may sensitize A549 cells to IR. It is reported that miR-21 could stimulate growth in NSCLC [ Cell apoptosis induced by IR is one of the most important effects of tumor radiotherapy. Furthermore, miR-21 is reported to be an antiapoptotic factor in lung cancer [ To explore the potential molecular mechanisms of radiosensitization by miR-21 knockdown in NSCLC A549 cells, we focused on analysis of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway because the influence of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway on IR-induced apoptotic propensity is well documented [ In summary, the present study found that downregulation of miRNA-21 sensitized radioresistant NSCLC A549 cells to IR by inhibiting cell proliferation and enhancing apoptosis through inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. A549 cells were transfected with either anti-miR-21 or anti-miR-NC and 48 h later were exposed to 8 Gy of IR and the growth characteristics of A549 cells were determined by MTT assay 72 hours after IR. Apoptosis in anti-miR-21- (or anti-miR-NC-) transfected A549 cells combined with (or without) IR (8.0 Gy) was detected through annexin V-FITC/PI staining by flow cytometric analysis.", "RanBPM contains several conserved domains including a SPla/Ryanodine receptor (SPRY), a protein interaction module ( Our previous investigations have provided evidence that RanBPM functions as an activator of apoptotic pathways and regulates the activation of apoptosis induced by DNA damage ( In follow-up studies aimed at characterizing IR-induced RanBPM relocalization, we found that RanBPM clustered into discrete perinuclear foci where it co-localized with ubiquitin, dynein and HDAC6, revealing that these RanBPM aggregates correspond to aggresomes. We previously reported that IR treatment induces RanBPM relocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm ( (A) Hela cells either untreated or 72 h after IR treatment (10 Gy) were immunostained with RanBPM and Golgin-97 antibodies and DAPI. To assess whether RanBPM IR-induced foci were indeed aggresomes, we co-stained Hela cells following IR treatment with an antibody directed against ubiquitin, a well-established marker for aggresomes ( Since aggresomes have been documented to form in response to proteasome inhibitors, such as MG132, we conducted experiments to determine whether RanBPM was recruited to aggresomes in response to MG132 in Hela cells. Following MG132 treatment, we observed the relocalization of both HDAC6 and dynein with RanBPM to perinuclear aggregates ( RanBPM expression is not affected either by IR ( (A) Hela cells stably expressing control shRNA or RanBPM shRNA were subjected to IR treatment (10 Gy) or left untreated, or treated with MG132 (10 \u00b5M) or vehicle (DMSO) and fixed 72 h following IR or 16 h following MG132. At least 150 cells were scored per experiment for the presence of RanBPM and HDAC6 aggresomes and the results (IR treatment, left graph, and MG132 treatment, right graph) are expressed as percentage of cells containing RanBPM aggresomes (solid bars) or HDAC6 aggresomes (open bars). Asterisks indicate statistical significance for the differences in percentage of aggresomes obtained in control versus RanBPM shRNA cells, Since aggresomes are formed in response to UPS defects, we thought it was important to determine whether the induction of aggresomes by IR is triggered specifically through signaling by the DNA damage response to the UPS, or is due to secondary effects of IR, such as protein oxidation. Asterisks indicate statistical significance between treatments and cell lines, Confocal microscopy analyses conducted on both IR and MG132-treated cells revealed that RanBPM and HDAC6 co-localized within the aggresome (as evidence by the white co-localized voxels, (A) IR (10 Gy, 72 h) and MG132 (10 \u00b5M, 16 h) treated Hela cells were analyzed using confocal microscopy, and colocalization of HDAC6 and RanBPM analyzed using Imaris software. Increased HDAC6 activity is known to be associated with increased cell motility, in part through deacetylation of \u03b1-tubulin, but also due to the increased chaperone function of deacetylated Hsp90 towards oncogenic proteins such as Akt/PKB, ErbB2 and c-Raf ( To our knowledge, this is the first report documenting aggresome formation in response to IR or other DNA damaging agents. We have shown here that both IR and etoposide that specifically induce DSBs result in the formation of aggresomes. Intriguingly, however, we only observed aggresomes in response to high doses of IR (10 Gy) which induce massive cell death ( This study has uncovered a new role for RanBPM in aggresome formation and as an HDAC6 inhibitor.", "This accidental observation led to important implications for the mechanism of IR, treatment of diabetes and the use of anti-aging agents such as rapamycin to prevent diseases. In MEM, basal levels of phospho-AKT(T308) and phospho-AKT(S473) were undetectable and insulin dramatically induced AKT phosphorylation on both sites ( The phosphorylation pattern of IRS1 in response to insulin was also changed in IR. Using antibodies against phospho-S1101, we found lack of phosphorylation of this residue in DMEM- and insulin-induced IR ( Changes in phosphorylation of IRS1 at S1101 could serve as a marker of IR, which is reversed by rapamycin. We therefore next investigated phosphorylation of IRS1 on S636/639, which was reported to be phosphorylated in the S6K1 feedback loop. Like S6, IRS1-S636/639 was not phosphorylated in MEM ( PF-4708671, an inhibitor of S6K, As shown in C2C12 cells are often used to study IR. In normoglycemic serum-free medium, insulin induced phospho-AKT and phospho-S6 ( Here we found that hyperglycemic medium caused IR in RPE cells. IR was associated with phosphorylation of the S6K and its substrates, S6 and IRS1 (S636/639). As IR was also manifested by the lack of induction of targets downstream of mTORC1 in response to insulin (such as pS6, HIF1 The effect of insulin, hyperglycemia and rapamycin on the phosphorylation of IRS1 is extremely complex. Second, hyperglycemia causes IR.", "In this study, we elucidated the role of integrins in regulation of IR-altered adhesion between breast cancer cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which is a key step in the initial phase of metastasis. While IR-induced adhesions between MDA-MB-231 cells to fibronectin, laminin, collagen I and collagen IV, only blocking of the adhesion between \u03b15\u03b21 integrin and fibronectin using anti-\u03b15\u03b21 integrin antibody could completely inhibit the radiation-induced adhesion of the cells. Cells (1 \u00d7 10 MDA-MB-231 cells were lysed in 2% NP-40 buffer (2% NP-40, 80 m Student\u2019s We first determined the effect of IR (10 Gy) on the avidity between breast cancer cells and each of the ECM proteins, including fibronectin (FN), laminin (LN), vitronectin (VN), collagen I (Col I) and collagen IV (Col IV). Our data show that while the expression of \u03b21 integrin was not significantly changed, the expression of \u03b15 integrin was increased in a time-dependent manner ( ATM and ATR protein kinases are a critical intermediate in a number of cellular responses to ionizing radiation, including phosphorylation of p53 and gene expressions ( Cancer metastasis is a complex process and consists of a series of distinct steps that result in the transfer tumor cells from a primary site to a distant locations ( To further determine the molecular mechanism of ionizing radiation-induced ECM interaction of breast cancer cells, we determined the role of integrins, known as ECM receptors, in mediating ionizing radiation-induced ECM protein binding of MDA-MB-231 cells which we clearly showed the adhesion of which was upregulated by IR ( Since ionizing radiation-induced expression of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin has been suggested as having an important role in the regulation of cancer cell invasiveness ( To elucidate the potential molecular mechanism for cell adhesion in response to IR, we determined the effect of IR on the surface and total expressions of \u03b15\u03b21 and \u03b12\u03b21 integrins since functional blocking of these integrins reduced the cell adhesion ( The authors thank Dr. Kimberly Suzanne George for editorial assistant. The effect of IR on adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells to ECM proteins.", "They were applied immediately following each IR dosing of 10 Gy/day for 4 days. Both CO and CWH significantly inhibited IR-induced MCP1 (p < 0.01), KC (p < 0.05), and G-CSF (p < 0.001). IR-induced erythema and blood vessel dilation were significantly reduced by CWH (p < 0.001) but not by CO at day 10 post-IR. Both agents inhibited IR-induced IL-1\u03b1 (p < 0.01), MCP1 (p < 0.05), and vascular endothelial growth factor (p < 0.05). There were continuous inhibitory effects of CWH on IR-induced skin toxicities and inflammation. In contrast, CO treatment resulted in skin reactions compared to IR alone. Our results suggest that both CO and CWH reduce IR-induced inflammation and CWH reduced IR-induced erythema. In summary, CWH showed promising effects in reducing IR-related inflammation and skin toxicities, and future proof-of-principal testing in humans will be critical in evaluating its potential application in preventing IR-induced skin toxicities.", "In the CeA, males displayed an increased number of PV-IR neurons compared to females, with no differences found between LAn and HAn. Sections were later developed in diaminobenzidine-peroxidase solution (DAB kit; Vector Labs, Burlingame CA) to visualize PV-IR cells. Separate, two-way ANOVAs were used to determine differences in the number of PV-IR cells for each brain region with sex and trait as between-subjects factors. For baseline anxiety-like behavior, Pearson\u2019s correlation between PV-IR and the %OA time in the CPu approached significance (Pearson\u2019s An initial finding of our work indicates that animals selectively bred for trait anxiety, after being phenotyped on the elevated plus maze, showed persistent anxiety-like behavioral profiles. However, analysis of total entries revealed that HAn females made significantly The effects of the estrous cycle on anxiety could explain the observed sex differences as previous work illustrates that during proestrous (i.e., elevated levels of progestin and plasma allopregnanolone) females show decreased anxiety-like behavior on the EPM ( CeA connections to the brainstem and hypothalamus are involved with not only anxiety but physiological responses such as blood pressure and contain calcium-binding parvalbumin proteins ( Although this study did not differentiate between GABA receptor subtypes, the finding that males exhibited a greater number of PV-IR cells in the CeA compared to females could partially account for the differing diazepam-mediated anxiolytic results. This is also supported by the significantly positive correlation between PV-IR in the CeA and diazepam induced behavior on the open arm. high anxiety low anxiety Diazepam elevated plus maze central amygdala parvalbumin immunoreactivity Female Long Evans rats bred for low anxiety phenotypes show Male animals were more sensitive to the anxiolytic effects of acute diazepam Male rats show greater parvalbumin immunoreactivity (PV-IR) in the central amygdala Females show greater PV-IR in the caudate putamen compared to males", "Life-threatening acute events are mainly due to rupture of unstable plaques, and the role of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in this process in IR, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome (T2DM/MetS) has not been fully addressed. Defective insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2)-mediated signalling produced insulin-resistant VSMCs with reduced survival, migration, and higher apoptosis than control cells. Silencing of IRS2 or inhibition of the V-akt murine thymomaviral oncogene homologue kinase (AKT)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent pathway in VSMCs augmented expression of the inflammatory chemokine fractalkine (CX3CL1) and its receptor CX3CR1, previously involved in atheroma plaque vulnerability. Analysis of a mouse model of IR-MetS and accelerated atherosclerosis, apoE-/-Irs2+/- mice, showed reduced VSMC survival, unstable plaques, and up-regulation of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis compared with apoE-/- mice. Human studies showed augmented soluble CX3CL1 plasma levels and CX3CR1 expression in monocytes from IR-MetS subjects compared with controls. IR increases plaque vulnerability by augmenting the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis, which is mechanistically linked to reduced VSMC survival. Thus, modulation of IRS2-dependent signalling emerges as a potential therapeutic strategy to promote VSMC survival and atheroma plaque stability and to reduce inflammatory mediators in IR-MetS.", "Therefore, we examined whether HPC protects the myocardium against IR via the ALOX12/TRPV1 pathway. HPC resulted in the upregulation of ALOX12 and myocardial 12(S)-HETE, and prevented IR-induced 12(S)-HETE reduction. We conclude that HPC reduces heart susceptibly to IR via ALOX12/TRPV1/PKC pathway, as shown by increased 12(S)-HETE expression in HPC hearts.", "IR generates DNA double-stranded breaks, which is a potent inducer of the DNA damage response. Following exposure to IR, p53 was upregulated and phosphorylated on serine 15 ( a, Western blot of JMJD3, p53, p-p53 (p53 serine 15 phosphorylation) and vinculin in human immortalized BJ fibroblasts either untreated or 6 hours after exposure to IR. From the ChIP-seq experiments we found that both p53 and JMJD3 were bound to significantly more DNA sites following IR compared to untreated cells ( Taken together, the genome-wide data on p53 and JMJD3 binding demonstrate that both proteins are upregulated and recruited to DNA sites in response to DNA damage. In summary, these results demonstrate that JMJD3 co-localizes with p53 at promoters, as well as distal enhancer elements, and confirms that the binding of p53 and JMJD3 to these sites increases after exposure to IR. The cells were exposed to IR and harvested for ChIP-qPCR assays after five hours. Moreover, we performed genome-wide mapping of JMJD3 and p53 by ChIP-seq in telomerase immortalized BJ fibroblasts after exposure to IR, which induces DNA damage and p53 activation. We found that JMJD3 is upregulated in response to DNA damage and that the binding of JMJD3 to both p53 targeted promoters and enhancers increases after IR treatment.", "Deficiency in KAP1 regulation not only impairs heterochromatic DSB repair but also sensitizes human cell lines to IR []. Thus, adult mouse retinas showed 53BP1 staining and IR-induced 53BP1 foci only in defined cell types, with rod and cone photoreceptors and bipolar cells exhibiting no 53BP1 signal. We observed a strict correlation between the cell-type-specific presence of IR-induced pATM and 53BP1 foci (C). In stark contrast to the adult retina, all cell types of the P4 retina, including rod photoreceptors, displayed IR-induced 53BP1 foci that largely colocalized with \u03b3H2AX and pATM foci (B and C). Compared with wild-type (WT) kidney cells, SCID kidney cells exhibited similar foci levels at 30 min after IR but significantly higher foci levels at later times ( A). The repair defect was already present at 2.5 and 5 hr, consistent with the role of DNA-PKcs as core NHEJ factor facilitating DSB repair at early and late times after IR. Similar to the results of the INL and kidney, SCID rods showed more foci than WT rods at early and late times after IR (C). However, foci formation during the first minutes relies on ATM such that AT cells exhibit reduced foci numbers until about 30\u201360 min after IR []. Here, we investigated \u03b3H2AX foci levels at 5 and 15 min after IR in vivo and confirmed that AT cells exhibit reduced foci levels in all tissues (A). We also investigated the presence of components of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex, which is known to be required for ATM activation [], and observed robust expression and IR-induced phosphorylation of MRE11 and NBS1 by western blotting (C). Thus, DSB repair in rod photoreceptors is downregulated on several levels: rods fail to form IR-induced 53BP1 foci and do not accumulate pATM at break sites; they downregulate several heterochromatin factors including KAP1; and, finally, they overexpress the KAP1 suppressor SPOC1.", "Previous studies of the intestine established a role for neutrophils, eicosanoids, the complement system and naturally occurring antibodies in IR-induced pathology. Furthermore, data indicate involvement of a lipid or lipid-like moiety in mediating IR-induced damage. While it is evident that the pathophysiology of IR-induced injury is complex and multi-factorial, we focus this review on the involvement of eicosanoids, phospholipids and neo-antigens in the early pathogenesis. Lipid changes occurring in response to IR, neo-antigens exposed and the role of a phospholipid transporter, phospholipid scramblase 1 will be discussed. The intestinal mucosa is among the organs most sensitive to IR (reviewed in [ Cases of acute mesenteric ischemia are classified by cause. In order of incidence, they are arterial embolism, arterial thrombus, non-occlusive and venous thrombosis (reviewed in [ The mesenteric arteries can maintain adequate perfusion of the intestine over a broad range of blood pressures, however below 40 to 45 mm Hg, perfusion is compromised (reviewed in [ Rodents are commonly used as research models for intestinal IR and have provided a large knowledge base regarding associated physiology and pathogenesis. Studies in mice have shown changes in the internal pH of enterocytes, abruptly increasing from 6.8 to 7.1 at the initiation of ischemia, and rapidly stabilizing at a pH of 6.3 by three minutes into ischemia [ Several factors contributing to IR-induced pathology will be discussed briefly; however, the majority of this review will focus on lipids, neo-antigens and phosopholipid scramblase 1 as they relate to IR-induced pathology. In the equine jejunum, Cox 1 protein is constitutively expressed and is increased, as is Cox 2, at 18 hours reperfusion following a two hour ischemic period [ The Cox enzymes catalyze the formation of prostaglandins, which, as stated above, are necessary but not sufficient for intestinal IR damage, at least in mice [ Another eicosanoid derived from AA in response to intestinal IR is leukotriene B The Cox enzymes also mediate the production of thromboxanes which promote coagulation and are increased by intestinal IR, similar to prostaglandins and leukotrienes. In both rats and dogs, thromboxane B The complement system, comprised of over 30 proteins, plays a significant role in the pathology resulting from IR. The involvement of both the classical and alternative pathways in IR injury was demonstrated in the early 1990s. Administration of soluble complement receptor type 1 attenuated intestinal damage and neutrophil infiltration in a rat model [ In accordance with the involvement of the classical complement pathway, antibodies are essential for IR injury. \u03b2 The other two identified neo-antigens induced by IR are the intracellular proteins non-muscle myosin heavy chain II and annexin IV. IR increased lysoPC with a concomitant decrease in PC [ The altered phospholipid composition resulting from hypoxia increases the fluidity of the cellular membrane, an effect that is reversible with a sufficient re-oxygenation period [ Inflamed tissue exhibits some of the same lipid changes found in HR studies. Colon biopsies from inflammatory bowel disease patients and inflamed intestinal mucosal samples contained significantly more AA than biopsies and mucosa from healthy control patients [ Evidence of lipid oxidation is found in both in vitro HR and in vivo IR studies. performed immunohistochemical staining for PLSCR1 on the hippocampal region of human brain samples from patients who had experienced and temporarily recovered from an ischemic insult and found an increase in PLSCR1 protein versus control samples in which IR did not occur [ Although the phenomenon of intestinal IR has been recognized for centuries and medical knowledge and technology have progressed immensely, a high mortality rate remains for those afflicted. While several aspects of intestinal IR-induced pathogenesis have been identified, the initial molecular response remains unknown. Recent studies have identified neo-antigens as potential triggers, but their roles remain undefined [ Mass spectrometry has been used to compare the intestinal lipid profiles of polar lipids and free fatty acids between different strains of mice, C57Bl6, As the lipid profiles from various strains of mice prior to and following IR are quite similar, this may be the inciting stimulus for the pathogenic cascade leading to tissue damage. In the absence of antibodies, Cox 2 transcription is not up-regulated and the production of PGE The identification of IR-induced neo-antigens is an important step in further dissecting the early molecular events involved in the pathogenesis. arachidonic acid adenosine tri-phosphate beta2-glycoprotein 1 cyclic adenosine mono-phosphate cyclooxygenase cytosolic phospholipase A2 complement receptor 2 electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry hypoxia re-oxygenation human umbilical vein endothelial cells immunoglobulin ischemia reperfusion lipoxygenase leukotriene B4 mannose binding lectin micro ribonucleic acid mammalian target of rapamycin 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells phosphatidic acid phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine prostaglandin E2 prostaglandin F2 alpha prostaglandin I2 phosphatidylinositol phospholipase A2 phospholipid scramblase phosphatidylserine recombination activating gene soluble complement receptor type 1 thromboxane B The pathogenesis of IR-induced injury is complex with many contributing factors.", "In fact, a recent study has shown that GRK2 in brown fat suppresses thermogenic gene expression and its loss increases energy expenditure, which may be responsible for the prevention of obesity and metabolic syndrome in the heterozygous GRK2 KO mice Our group and others have explored the role of GRK2 in cardiovascular disease and have described its role in the pathophysiology of HF Several lines of evidence lead to the conclusion that GRK2 is a crucial modulator of IR, both systemically and in the heart Data from our lab has recently emerged showing how GRK2 can directly promote IR and lowered glucose metabolism in the cardiomyocyte, directly implicating the kinase activity of GRK2 in this process. First, in liver cells and adipocytes, GRK2, through a Importantly, elevated myocardial GRK2 levels enhanced negative cardiac glucose metabolism after ischemic injury and these effects precede GRK2-mediated ventricular contractile dysfunction Interestingly, the interaction between GRK2 and IRS1 is dependent on an intact C-terminus of GRK2 since introduction of the \u03b2ARKct peptide inhibits insulin-mediated GRK2-dependent IRS1 phosphorylation while \u03b2ARKct expression improves Akt activation and GLUT4 membrane translocation in response to insulin An interesting idea that arises from these data is that GRK2 may be a master regulator of cellular metabolism by controlling signal transduction from multiple receptors (GPCRs and RTKs) in addition to the cellular production and expenditure of energy through the regulation of \u03b2AR-mediated contractile function. A) Normally, insulin binding to its receptor activates a downstream signaling process involving IRS1 that ultimately results in the movement of GLUT4 from the cytosol to the membrane, allowing for increased glucose uptake. B) Excess GRK2, as in heart failure, attenuates the insulin response via phosphorylation of IRS1 and inhibition of GLUT4 membrane translocation.", "However, the mechanism of IRS1/2 recruitment to the IR remains elusive. Here, we identify adaptor protein APPL1 as a critical molecule that promotes IRS1/2-IR interaction. APPL1 forms a complex with IRS1/2 under basal conditions, and this complex is then recruited to the IR in response to insulin or adiponectin stimulation. The interaction between APPL1 and IR depends on insulin- or adiponectin-stimulated APPL1 phosphorylation, which is greatly reduced in insulin target tissues in obese mice. In addition, we demonstrate that phosphorylation at Ser We generated APPL1 KO mice by the gene trap technique ( To elucidate the mechanisms underlying APPL1-deficiency-induced insulin resistance, we examined the effect of Because APPL1 plays an important role in adiponectin signaling ( To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying APPL1 action, we examined whether altering APPL1 expression affects insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IR\u03b2, IRS1, and Akt in C2C12 myocytes. Overexpression ( There are six tyrosine residues on IR\u03b2, and phosphorylation at these sites is essential for IR\u03b2 to interact with Src homology 2 (SH2) or PTB-domain-containing proteins ( APPL1 shares a high sequence homology with its isoform, APPL2 ( We investigated whether APPL1 is able to substitute IRS1/2 to mediate insulin signaling. While we found that overexpression of APPL1 greatly enhanced insulin-stimulated Akt activation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking IRS1 ( To further characterize the interaction between APPL1 and IRS proteins, we performed in vitro binding studies. We found that the GST-APPL1, but not GST, interacted with IRS1 ( We investigated whether APPL1 promotes insulin signaling by facilitating the recruitment of IRS1 onto IR\u03b2, which is a critical step for the transduction of insulin signaling to downstream targets ( To determine if the APPL1/IR/IRS1 complex is dynamically regulated by insulin, we examined the kinetics of insulin-induced APPL1/IRS1 dissociation and IRS1/IR\u03b2 interaction. Insulin stimulation led to a time-dependent dissociation between APPL1 and IRS1 concurrently with a time-dependent increase in IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation and the interaction between IR\u03b2 and IRS1 ( APPL1 contains several potential phosphorylation sites including Ser To investigate the role of Ser APPL1 has previously been shown to bind to inactive Akt ( To determine whether adiponectin has an effect on APPL1 phosphorylation and interaction with IR\u03b2, we treated C2C12 cells with adiponectin alone or together with insulin. Adiponectin treatment greatly stimulated APPL1 phosphorylation at Ser To investigate the role of adiponectin-stimulated APPL1 phosphorylation in regulating APPL1/IR\u03b2 interaction, we overexpressed RNAi-resistant wild-type and phosphorylation mutants (S401A and S401D) of APPL1 in APPL1-suppressed C2C12 cells. Replacing Ser While insulin treatment triggered the dissociation between APPL1 and IRS1/2 ( In this study, we demonstrate that APPL1 interacts with both IR\u03b2 and IRS1/2 and acts as an adaptor protein to facilitate the insulin-stimulated recruitment of IRS1/2 onto IR\u03b2 ( APPL1 has previously been shown to be phosphorylated at Ser Adiponectin promotes APPL1 Ser In addition to the IR and IRS1/2, APPL1 has previously been shown to interact with other components of the insulin-signaling pathway, including the p110 subunit of PI3K and Akt ( APPL1 is located in the nucleus, endosome, and cytosol in various cells ( Our results show that KO of the The mechanisms underlying the insulin-sensitizing effects of adiponectin remain to be fully elucidated. Our results demonstrate that APPL1 potentiates the effect of insulin on IRS1/2, but not IR\u03b2, tyrosine phosphorylation in cells and in vivo, which is consistent with our previous finding that adiponectin, by suppressing the negative effect of S6K on IRS1, promotes insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1, but not the IR ( In summary, our study has identified APPL1 as a binding partner of IR and IRS proteins. (H\u2013J) Glucose infusion rates (GIR) (H), total glucose disposal (I), and hepatic glucose production (HGP) suppression (J) during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.

Ex vivo treatment of muscles with insulin showed increased phosphorylation of IR (Tyr972) in controls, but LP rats showed higher basal phosphorylation. A gestational LP diet leads to insulin resistance in adult offspring by a mechanism involving inefficient insulin-induced IR, Insulin receptor substrate-1, and AS160 phosphorylation and impaired glucose transporter type 4 translocation.", "In response to IR, activated ATM phosphorylates its various substrates, including transcription factors such as p53, BRCA1, CREB, and ATF2 . Several studies regarding functional changes of Sp1 in response to IR-induced DNA double-strand breaks have been reported . For example, IR causes immediate increase in levels of hyper-phosphorylated forms of Sp1, inducing transient elevation in its DNA binding activity . However, possible functions of Sp1 in IR-induced DNA double-strand breaks are not well understood. Confocal laser microscopy analysis revealed co-localization of phosphorylated Sp1 at Ser-101 with phosphorylated ATM at Ser-1981 upon IR, the affected sites representing DSBs in the nucleus. For IR, cells were exposed to gamma irradiation at indicated doses (Gy). For experiments with alkaline phosphatase treatment, HEK293T cells exposed to gamma irradiation with 20 Gy were collected at 15 min post-IR, suspended in AP buffer [50 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8), 0.5 M NaCl, 2% NP40, protease inhibitor cocktail], stored on ice for 30 min and then incubated in a reaction mixture containing 10 U calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP: New England Biolabs) and 10 mM MgCl for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. For comparison with transcriptional activities of wild-type Sp1 and Sp1-S101A in mammalian cells after IR treatment, U2OS cells were transfected with siRNA against 3\u2032 UTR of endogenous Sp1 using a microporator, followed by transfection with pcDNA-RHF/Sp1 or pcDNA-RHF/Sp1-S101A together with pCAT TATA+Sp1 (\u221255)+Sp1 (\u221275) using lipofectamine 2000 at 48 h post-electroporation. At 24 h post-transfection of the plasmids, cells were exposed to IR and harvested 4 h post-IR. At 4 days post-transfection, they were exposed to IR at 1 Gy and 300, 900, and 3000 cells were reseeded onto 60-mm dishes at 2 h post-IR. HFF2 cells were harvested at various times post-IR, washed with PBS twice, and then lyzed for 10 min on ice with ice-cold 0.5% TX-100mCSK buffer [10 mM PIPES (pH 6.8), 100 mM NaCl, 300 mM sucrose, 1 mM MgCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.5% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)] containing 20 mM NaF. In order to confirm whether transcription factor Sp1 is hyper-phosphorylated by IR as reported previously , HEK293T cells were exposed to 5, 10 or 20 Gy. Alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) treatment of lysates prepared from HEK293T cells exposed to IR changed the slower-migrating forms of Sp1 to the faster-migrating form (B), indicating hyper-phosphorylation in response to IR. As shown in C, hyper-phosphorylation of Sp1 was observed by 2 min post-IR and reached a peak at 15 min, then decreasing gradually. To determine whether ATM is the kinase responsible for Sp1 hyper-phosphorylation after IR, HEK293T cells were transfected with wild type ATM (wt ATM) or kinase-dead ATM (kd ATM) expression vectors together with a Flag-Sp1 expression vector, followed by exposure to 25 Gy of IR (A). When HEK293T cells were transfected with the wild-type ATM expression vector, Flag-Sp1 was efficiently hyper-phosphorylated upon IR, this correlating with ATM phosphorylation at Ser-1981 (A, lane 6). Without IR the ATM phosphorylation was low and only a part of Flag-Sp1 became hyper-phosphorylated (A, lane 4). In contrast, when cells were introduced with kinase-dead ATM, hyper-phosphorylation of Flag-Sp1 was not observed even after IR (A, lane 5), although IR elicited phosphorylation of Ser-1981 on the kinase dead ATM. The level of endogenous ATM in HEK293T cells appears to be too low to phosphorylate over-expressed exogenous Sp1 even with exposure to IR (A, lane 2). These observations strongly suggest that hyper-phosphorylation of Sp1 induced by IR is dependent on activation of ATM kinase. We examined whether Flag-tagged Sp1 proteins (Flag-Sp1) containing alanine mutations of serine/threonine in each SQ/TQ site were phosphorylated following IR and found more than half of the Flag-tagged wild-type Sp1 to be converted to slower-migrating forms (B). In contrast, most of Flag-Sp1-S101A protein with Ser-101 mutated to alanine remained as the faster-migrating form post-IR (B). These observations suggested the phosphorylation of Ser-101 to be attributable to the IR-induced electromobility shift of Sp1. Furthermore, it could be shown that Ser-101 on Sp1 was phosphorylated in HEK293T and HFF2 cells with IR treatment using an \u03b1-Sp1 (pS101) antibody (D and E), strongly suggesting preferential phosphorylation by activated ATM. Interestingly, an antibody specific for phosphorylated Ser-56 on Sp1 [\u03b1-Sp1 (pS56)] could detect increase at very early times after IR in both HEK293T and HFF2 cells, corresponding to the appearance of phosphorylation of Ser-101 on Sp1 and Ser-1981 of ATM (D and E). In ATM-deficient AT1OS/T-n cells, neither delayed migration of Sp1 on SDS-PAGE nor phosphorylation of Ser-56 and Ser-101 residues were observed even after exposure to IR (E), clearly indicating ATM-dependence. To examine whether hyper-phosphorylation of Sp1 is solely induced by ATM-dependent DNA damage, HEK293T cells were left untreated or exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light (50 J/m), hydroxyurea (HU) (2 mM), or IR (20 Gy) as a positive control (A). In order to confirm that Sp1 silencing increases sensitivity to DNA damage, survival rates of cells transfected with siRNA against 3\u2032 UTR of endogenous Sp1 or with non-targeting siRNA were calculated after IR treatment (1 Gy) (A). About 60% of cells transfected with the non-targeting siRNA survived after IR treatment. In contrast, in cells depleted of endogenous Sp1, only 12% survival was evident post-IR. Next, in order to examine whether Ser-101 phosphorylation affects transcriptional activity, we performed Sp1 specific reporter gene assays with exogenous expression of wt Sp1 or Sp1-S101A in Sp1-silenced cells exposed to IR. U2OS cells were introduced with siRNA targeting the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of Sp1 mRNA, and 48 h thereafter expression vectors of Flag-tagged wild-type Sp1 or Sp1-S101A were transfected together with a reporter plasmid, pCAT TATA+Sp1 (\u221255)+Sp1 (\u221275) containing only two GC-boxes and a TATA consensus sequence, followed by exposure to IR. When Flag-tagged wild-type Sp1 was expressed exogenously, phosphorylation of Ser-101 reached a peak by 1 h post-IR and thereafter gradually decreased. Transcriptional activities at 4 h post-IR were analyzed by calculating the percentage conversion of unacetylated [C]chloramphenicol to the acetylated form. Unexpectedly, exposure to IR affected the transcriptional activity of Flag-tagged wild-type Sp1 only marginally. Similarly, the basal activity of Flag-tagged Sp1-S101A was almost the same as that of wild type Sp1 before and after exposure to IR. Next, we examined subcellular dynamics of phosphorylated Sp1 in HFF2 cells exposed to IR (20 Gy) using biochemical fractionation. At 5, 20, 60, 120 and 240 min post-IR, cells were subjected to biochemical fractionation. The total level of Sp1 protein in the Triton X-100 insoluble pellet remained constant until 4 h post-IR. The detergent insoluble form of Sp1 phosphorylated at Ser-101 appeared at 5 min post-IR and its level remained constant for approximately 60 min, followed by rapid decrease. Since levels of the chromatin bound form of Sp1 phosphorylated at Ser-101 increased rapidly after IR, the subcellular localization was determined in Triton X-100 extracted cells using confocal laser microscopy (C). Following IR, the ATM phosphorylated at Ser-1981 formed punctate spots (foci) within the nucleus, representing the sites of DSBs. Interestingly, the Sp1 phosphorylated at Ser-101 formed foci in nucleus by 10 min post-IR, co-localizing with those for Ser-1981 phosphorylated ATM. DNA double-stranded breaks induced by IR or zeocin treatment activate the ATM dependent DNA damage pathway, whereas replication stresses due to UV irradiation or HU induce ATR dependent DNA damage signaling, both leading to phosphorylation of Ser-101 on Sp1. We found here that although phosphorylation of Ser-101 on Sp1 does not markedly affect its transcriptional activity, the phosphorylated Sp1 co-localized to damaged sites in nuclei with ATM phosphorylated at Ser-1981, recruited in early stages post-IR. Our observation that Sp1 phosphorylated at Ser-101 forms foci in nuclei by 10 min post-IR, co-localizing with ATM phosphorylated at Ser-1981 is clearly in line with the idea that Sp1 might play a role in DNA repair pathway through impacting on DNA recombination at damage sites in GC-rich regions. Alternatively, interactions between Sp1 and any partner transcriptional factor(s) might be affected by the phosphorylation state although the transcriptional activity of Sp1 itself was not found to be appreciably affected by Ser-101 phosphorylation in response to IR. Phosphorylation of Ser-56 on Sp1 was here observed after IR and zeocin treatment but not with UV and HU.", "The IR animal model was made by feeding rats with high fructose diet for 8 weeks. Taurine (20-80 mM) concentration-dependently relaxed precontractions induced by KCl (30 mM) and phenylephrine (1 microM) in NC rings, but enhanced the precontractions in IR rings. Denudation of the endothelium and pretreatment with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester ester (0.1 mM) reversed the contraction enhancement of taurine to relaxation in IR rings. Tetraethylammonium (10 mM) nearly abolished taurine-induced relaxation of NC rings, and augmented taurine-induced contraction enhancement in IR rings. Iberiotoxin (100 nM) only augmented the contraction enhancement in IR rings. 4-Aminopyridine (1 mM), glibenclamide (10 microM) and indomethacin (10 muM) had no influence on the effect of taurine in both NC and IR rings. Taurine enhances contractions in IR aortic rings but relaxes the contractions in normal rat aortic ring; the enhancement is endothelium-dependent and the relaxation is endothelium-independent. TEA-sensitive K(+) channel may be involved in these actions; BK(Ca) channel dysfunction and endothelium-derived substances may be related to the contraction enhancement induced by taurine in IR aorta.", "We aimed at preventing diabetes by inhibiting PKCepsilon-induced serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 with novel PKCepsilon abrogating peptides. Western blot analysis showed that the increased phosphoserine(636, 639) content on IRS-1 in gastrocnemius muscle of diabetic animals was reduced three fold, the PKB/AKT activity increased two fold and muscle GLUT4 tended to increase, compared with controls. KCe-16 and KCe-12 peptides derived from PKCepsilon substrate-binding region prevented the nutritional diabetes and protected muscle IRS-1 from PKCepsilon-induced serine phosphorylation, abrogating the insulin-signalling impediment in the Psammomys model of type 2 diabetes.", "IR was measured by means of the homeostasis model assessment and oral glucose insulin sensitivity. In logistic regression analysis of factors associated with NAFLD, homeostasis model assessment IR (ExpB, 1.607; 95% confidence interval, 1.058-2.440; P <0.02) and high-density lipoprotein (0.952; 95% confidence interval, 0.814-1.075; P <0.03) were the most significant. IR, as has already been proved, is associated with NAFLD.", "Of the various TOM compounds reported to inhibit the IR activation of NF-\u03baB, danshensu was chosen as a final candidate based on the results of structural comparisons with human metabolites and monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) was identified as the putative target enzyme. Moreover, it suppressed IR-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, expressions of NF-\u03baB-regulated prosurvival and proinflammatory genes, and A large proportion of cancer-related deaths are caused by lung cancer, which remains one of the most common cancers worldwide. The former is known to be expressed in intestine, liver, and peripheral adrenergic neurons whereas MAOB is expressed in brain, liver, and lungs Based on previous findings, we hypothesized that TOM-derived human metabolites mimetic NF-\u03baB inhibitors could regulate IR-induced radioresistance and EMT in NSCLC cells with lower toxicity and fewer side effects. NSCLC cells were treated with different concentrations of danshensu or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as vehicle ( In a previous study, we suggested that IR increases the activity of NF-\u03baB in NSCLC cells We next examined transcriptional changes of We next examined IR-induced transcriptional changes of Several lines of evidence have shown that NF-\u03baB and inflammation influence EMT and metastasis Since danshensu was found to have a radiosensitizing and EMT-inhibitory effect in NSCLC cells, we further examined these effects TOM is used to treat multiple cancer types, prevent cancer, and regulate tumor development with fewer side effects Because MAOs inactivate catecholamine neurotransmitters, including adrenaline and dopamine, the inhibitions of their activities have been viewed as a means of achieving neuroprotective effects. When isoform-selective inhibitors were developed, the inhibitors of MAOA and MAOB were found to exhibit antidepressant effects and therapeutic effects in Parkinson\u2019s diseases, respectively, and thus, subsequent studies on MAOB were centered on their roles in neurons, glial cells, and in neurodegenerative diseases Danshensu is a hydrophilic component of The present study confirms that the mRNA and protein expressions of MAOB are higher in NSCLC cells than in normal lung cells ( According to our luciferase reporter gene assay data ( In the present study, we searched for TOM candidates that inhibit IR-induced NF-\u03baB activation in NSCLC cells by utilizing online databases and comparing structural properties to those of human metabolites. Danshensu was found to significantly inhibit IR-induced MAOB activity. Furthermore, danshensu and the known MAOB inhibitor, selegiline, both downregulated NF-\u03baB signaling and the development of aggressive phenotypes in IR-treated NSCLC cells.", "Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effect and potential mechanism of EPO in renal IR injury. Kidney IR injury in rats was established by clamping the left renal artery for 30 minutes followed by 24 hours of reperfusion, along with contralateral nephrectomy. These findings demonstrated that EPO pretreatment can attenuate renal IR injury by inhibiting apoptosis by promoting activation of the ERK/p53 signaling.", "For example, sublethal doses of IR increase the migratory and invasive potentials of cultured cancer cells [ Sublethal doses of IR can activate the transcription factor STAT3, which in turn promotes Bcl-X Heparin-degrading endosulfatases (SULFs) are extracellular enzymes that remove sulfate groups from heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) [ Two isoforms of SULF are known, namely SULF1 and SULF2. Although the function of SULF1 remains largely unknown, SULF2 was identified as a potential cancer-driving gene in unbiased screening studies of glioma [ In this study, we performed a microarray analysis to identify novel cellular components that are induced by sublethal doses of IR. This preference was based on the view that extracellular components are more attractive therapeutic and diagnostic targets than intracellular components, because certain therapeutic and diagnostic strategies, including the use of neutralizing antibodies and the diagnostic use of blood samples, are more readily applicable to extracellular targets [ To identify novel functional genes that respond to IR, human A549 lung cancer cells were irradiated with \u03b3-rays (10 Gy). These cells were highly resistant to IR and survived the treatment. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR analyses further confirmed that 10 Gy of \u03b3-rays increased SULF2 mRNA levels in A549 cells by >2-fold, which was evident at 24-48 h after irradiation (Figure SULF2 is a transcriptional target of p53 [ We previously showed that sublethal doses (10 Gy) of IR promote A549 cell invasion by stimulating the STAT3/Bcl-X The results from RT-PCR and real-time PCR experiments also confirmed the ability of IR to increase IL-6 mRNA levels in A549 cells, as observed 24-48 h after irradiation (Figure SULF2 can modulate the signaling processes of various cell-surface receptors, and activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is one such example [ IL-6 can stimulate STAT3 [ To analyze the expression and function of SULF2 To investigate whether SULF2 mediates the pro-invasive activity of IR Considering the ability of SULF2 and IL-6 to increase the cellular levels of Bcl-X In this study, we showed that IR promotes the expression and extracellular accumulation of SULF2. Using p53-null and p53-silenced cells, we also verified that p53 mediates IR-induced SULF2 expression. As SULF2 induction was observed using a sublethal dose of IR, which promotes cell invasion, we subsequently investigated the possible involvement of SULF2 in IR-induced cell invasion. Indeed, we found that SULF-2 knockdown attenuates the ability of IR to stimulate the STAT3/Bcl-X The microarray, PCR, western blot, and ELISA analyses also revealed that IR induced the expression and extracellular accumulation of IL-6 under our experimental conditions. This decision was based on a previous report showing that SULF2 can stimulate the \u03b2-catenin pathway [ We believe that this pathway is also responsible for the IR-induced cellular resistance to death stimuli. The cytoprotective functions of SULF2 and IL-6 were initially suggested by the observation that SULF2 overexpression or IL-6 treatment protected cells from lethal concentrations of H Figure IR induces the expression of SULF2 via p53. IL-6 then stimulates the STAT3-Bcl-X In conclusion, we showed that SULF2 is a novel secretory protein that responds to IR and increases cellular invasiveness and resistance. Therefore, the SULF2 pathway may be used as a diagnostic and therapeutic target for predicting and overcoming the malignant actions of IR.", "This study demonstrated that downregulation of GDF15 in HAECs partially prevented cellular senescence triggered by IR, which was confirmed by recovery of cell proliferation and reverse senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) staining. The present study demonstrated that the GDF15 expression levels were increased in both replicative senescence and premature senescence with IR treatment of human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Microarray analyses revealed that GDF15 expression increased following exposure to IR (data not shown). We confirmed GDF15 expression was increased in both dose- and time-dependent manners (Figure Several phenotypes were induced by IR exposure in vascular cells, such as a decrease in mitogen-induced proliferation, expression of SA-\u03b2-gal, and a characteristically enlarged and flattened morphology. To investigate the role of GDF15 in cellular senescence, we tested the effect of GDF15 downregulation using GDF15 siRNA during premature senescence triggered by IR treatment. Following GDF15 siRNA, GDF15 expression was silenced in approximately 75% of the young HAECs (Figure Because GDF15 expression levels were increased in senescent cells and following IR treatment, we tested whether GDF15 overexpression had an impact on cellular senescence in HAECs. The damage to endothelial cells by IR includes changes in permeability, disruption of the cytoskeleton, angiogenic capacity impediments, and premature senescence [ The present study provided the first evidence of GDF15 involvement in cellular senescence of human primary endothelial cells through IR-induced damage. We demonstrated that GDF15 plays an important role in IR-induced senescence of endothelial cells by demonstrating that GDF15 expression was increased during replicative senescence or IR exposure (Figure Accumulating evidence suggests that the p53 and p16/Rb tumor suppressor pathways are key regulators of the senescence response [ Endothelial cells are sensitive to stress-induced senescence and have both p16-dependent and p53-dependent pathways of senescence. Stained cells were analyzed by the CyFlow Cellular SA-\u03b2-gal activity was measured as previously described [ This work was supported by the Basic Science Research Program (NRF-2013R1A1A2058621) through the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) and a grant of the Korea Institute of Radiological and Medical Sciences(KIRAMS)(1711031819/50526-2016), funded by Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, Republic of Korea.", "Furthermore, as compared with the control group, the levels of PPAR-\u03b3/IR mRNA and protein expression were significantly decreased in the model group (P<0.01), and significantly increased in the rosiglitazone group and some of the orthogonal experiment groups (P<0.01). In conclusion, a combination of puerarin, baicalin and berberine induced favorable effects on NAFLD by upregulating hepatic PPAR-\u03b3 and IR expression levels, and different proportions of monomer compositions exerted variable positive effects on various stages of NAFLD.", "While there has been some interest in targeting Chk2, the major downstream DDR effector of ATM, development has largely been hampered by a lack of specificity and limited combination cytotoxicity of Chk2 targeting compounds ( ATM is activated following DSBs and plays a major role in the DDR to DSBs caused by IR. Following a IR-induced DSB, the Ku dimer (green/magenta) engage the DNA terminus.", "In the present study, we showed that resistin induces hypertension and IR in wild type (WT) mice, but not in Hypertension, one of the independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), affects approximately 70% of patients with diabetes, and the risk of CVD in diabetic patients is three times higher than that in healthy individuals Resistin was first identified as an adipokine with a critical role in IR Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a putative resistin receptor that has been proposed to contribute to resistin-induced inflammation and IR To examine the effect of resistin on hypertension, BP was measured in WT mice treated with resistin (Retn) or PBS (Con) using the tail-cuff method. Resistin had no effect on SBP and DBP in WT mice pre-treated with perindopril ( In our previous study, resistin upregulated p65 mRNA and protein expression Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that patients with diabetes are more likely to develop hypertension, which increases their risk for CVD Studies in rodents and humans have suggested that resistin promotes IR Previous studies have implicated resistin in the regulation of certain vasoconstrictors and vasodilators Unlike mice, in human, resistin is produced mainly in macrophages rather than in adipocytes Taken together, our data indicate that resistin induces IR and hypertension in mice via a mechanism dependent on TLR4 and RAS, suggesting that resistin is a crucial factor linking diabetes and hypertension.", "C6-L xenograft mice were treated locally with 50-Gy \u03b3-irradiation (\u03b3-IR) in five 10-Gy fractions. Metastatic tumors were evaluated after \u03b3-IR by imaging techniques. Metastatic lung nodules were detected by BLI and PET/CT after 6\u20139 weeks of \u03b3-IR in 6 (17.1%) of the 35 mice. Therefore, many investigators utilize advance imaging techniques to monitor neoplastic progression to metastasis, such as bioluminescence imaging (BLI), computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) ( In the present study, metastatic tumors in C6-L xenografted mice were studied after local treatment with fractionated \u03b3-IR. To accurately detect the metastatic nodules after \u03b3-IR, we observed the effect of \u03b3-IR on distant metastatic tumor growth using different imaging modalities, such as BLI and PET/CT. A non-invasive longitudinal imaging study with repeated measurements of metastatic nodules after \u03b3-IR indicated extensive colonization of C6-L cells in the lungs within 6 weeks after \u03b3-IR. We also identified and described the molecular events occurring after \u03b3-IR through gene expression profiling to elucidate genetic changes. We identified the differentially expressed genes between the \u03b3-IR primary tumors vs. non-\u03b3-IR primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules vs. \u03b3-IR primary tumors using an Agilent Expression microarray contained ~30,003 Entrez Gene RNAs. Total RNA from primary tumors and IR-induced metastatic tissue for each model were used for expression profiling. The schedule for obtaining the BLI and nuclear medicine images beginning 4 weeks after \u03b3-IR is presented in Metastatic nodules at secondary sites in the non-IR tumor model were monitored for 6 weeks by [ The expression patterns of whole mRNAs were analyzed by microarray to elucidate the changes in NRPT, RPT and metastatic lung nodules. A hierarchical clustering analysis of 3,881 genes (\u22652-fold change, P-value <0.05) indicated differentially expressed genes between the NRPT, RPT and three metastatic lung nodules ( In the present study, we observed distant metastasis after local \u03b3-IR using BLI of fLuc gene expressing rat glioma and [ BLI has relatively low cost and high throughput capability, but the depth dependence of the signal is a major disadvantage in small animals. Therefore, metastatic tumors in lung and spleen after \u03b3-IR were confirmed by small-animal PET/CT. [ In the present study, we evaluated [ Recent studies have shown that a decreased cellular proliferation capacity is an early event in response to 20-Gy IR ( We evaluated the metastatic tumors after \u03b3-IR and found invasive/migration ability after local treatment of C6-L xeno-graft mice, suggesting that the small number of C6-L cells that survived in locally \u03b3-IR treated tumors have more potential to metastasize, which is the main reason for recurrence of glioma after radiotherapy. The microarray study revealed more surviving cancer cells with cancer stem cell markers in the \u03b3-IR primary tumors compared with those in the non-IR primary tumors. After formation of metastatic lung nodules in our experiments, expression of cancer stem cell markers may be downregulated as shown in our microarray data ( In summary, metastatic tumors were detected after fractionated \u03b3-IR with The present study was supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF) grant funded by the Korea government (MEST) (NRF-2012M2A2A7013480). Detection of metastatic tumors after \u03b3-IR by bioluminescence imaging (BLI). The mice were imaged using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) 6 weeks after \u03b3-IR using uptake of [ Comparison of primary and metastatic lung nodules. Metastatic lung nodules after \u03b3-IR with the EMT and enhanced cancer stem cell markers, resulting in C6-L metastasis and recurrence. However, the expression of cancer stem cell marker was downregulated in metastatic lung nodules after \u03b3-IR.", "The Cancer Prevention Study II found that overweight and obese women had an increased relative risk of breast cancer mortality compared to women of normal weight, defined by body mass index (BMI) [ The Health, Eating, Activity and Lifestyle (HEAL) study found that Black women with breast cancer had higher insulin resistance scores than White women when measured by the homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) [ Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women in the U.S. [ In this study we aim to determine whether metabolic factors associated with obesity, the metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes are more common in Black women with newly diagnosed breast cancer than White women, and whether these metabolic abnormalities are associated with tumor characteristics associated with a poor prognosis and with increased IR and IGF-1R expression and signaling in the tumors. Insulin resistance will be calculated from the HOMA-IR ([fasting plasma glucose (mg/dL) \u00d7 fasting serum insulin (uU/ml)]/405) [ The final pathology report will be obtained which contains the tumor size, histological grade, nodal status, ER, PR and HER2/Neu status. Immunohistochemistry staining will be performed using previously described methods to detect the presence of the total IR\u03b2 ( Four 5\u00b5m sections will be cut from formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks and RNA will be isolated from the samples using the RNeasy FFPE Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), as per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For each population (White and Black), we will compare good and poor prognosis patients with respect to age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, income, education, access to care, stage at diagnosis family history of breast cancer, smoking status, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, lipid profile, medications, use of estrogen, fasting serum insulin, plasma glucose, HbA1c, C-peptide, IGFBP-1, tumor IR\u03b2, tumor IGF-1R\u03b2, pAkt, pErk. Multivariable analyses for each racial group will be performed to examine the association between insulin resistance (HOMA-IR>2.8) and poor tumor prognosis (NPI>4.4) using logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounding factors and assessing mediating factors for each group. Further, we will assess whether the association between tumor IR and IGF-1R, pAkt and pERK1/2 correlate with tumor prognosis, and whether the degree of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), serum insulin concentration, and poor tumor prognosis differ significantly between racial groups. In exploratory analyses, we will also further stratify our analyses according to measures of metabolic syndrome to determine whether the associations between IR expression and tumor prognosis for each racial group are mediated by any of these factors. This study is powered to detect a significant interaction by race of the association between insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and poor prognosis breast cancer (NPI >4.4). Power calculations considered the following factors: the national U.S. prevalence of HOMA-IR>2.8 among healthy, non-diabetic women is 23% in White women, and 33% in Black women; the prevalence of poor prognosis breast cancer, defined as NPI>4.4, in a large, racially and ethnically diverse Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) population of breast cancer patients is 33% in White women and 44% in Black women (unpublished data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California). A prior study examining the relationship between insulin resistance and mortality among a sample of predominantly White women with breast cancer found a hazard ratio=1.6 among women with HOMA-IR scores >2.7 [ The linked epidemics of obesity and diabetes mellitus that disparately affect Black women, coupled by Black women\u2019s greater mortality from breast cancer require exploration of possible mechanistic links. We also anticipate finding the presence of the IR and IGF-1R in breast cancer tissue, but do not necessarily expect to see any association between the presence of these receptors and the presence of systemic insulin resistance. Rather, we expect to find a racial difference in ratio of IR-A to IR-B, related to the severity of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, and the prognostic index of the cancer, as other have reported increased IR-A to IR-B ratio in subtypes of breast cancer with a worse prognosis [37, 38]. In contrast to those studies, we expect to find an association between insulin resistance and the presence of increased IR signaling in the tumors. We expect that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt pathway, rather than the ERK1/2 pathway will be the main signaling pathway activated by the IR in breast cancers from hyperinsulinemic patients. The novel aspect of this study is that it will explore whether insulin resistance, endogenous hyperinsulinemia and IR signaling differ across racial groups, and whether insulin resistance and increased signaling through the IR in breast cancer cells can explain the differences in the breast cancer prognosis in White and Black women. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) trial testing metformin treatment for breast cancer in the adjuvant setting is currently underway (NCT01101438, Ultimately, if we discover in humans that hyperinsulinemia and the IR signaling pathway are of importance in breast cancer prognosis, then in the future, examining breast cancer specimens for activation of the IR signaling pathway would allow for the use of therapy targeting this pathway in patients who are refractory to current treatment. If insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia can explain the differences in prognosis between Black and White women (beyond any differences in SES, access to medical care and other known risk factors for breast cancer survival), then therapies that decrease insulin resistance and block IR signaling may be used to reduce disparities in breast cancer survival. Gene Expression analysis of Insulin Receptor Isoform A and B. Insulin Receptor isoform A and B gene expression as determines by Nanostring nCounter analysis in initial 12 patient samples demonstrating the variation in IR-A and IR-B ratios between patients.", "Depletion of CHD2 from SV40-immortalized VH10 human fibroblasts using three independent siRNAs reduced the clonogenic survival of these cells after IR to the same extent as knockdown of DSB repair factor XRCC4 ( Chromosomal DSBs are repaired by HR or NHEJ. PAR binding levels of CHD2 CHD2 Promotes DSB Repair by NHEJ (A) Clonogenic survival after IR exposure of VH10-SV40 cells transfected with the indicated siRNAs. (L) Clonogenic survival after IR exposure of siRNA-transfected VH10-SV40 cells.", "IR was evaluated by homeostatic model assessment-IR method. HbA1C was marginally high in the obese group ( In this study on South Indian subjects, proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and hs-CRP, despite being high, did not show any causal correlation either with abdominal obesity or with IR. Even the anti-inflammatory adipokine, AN did not show any correlation with IR. [ The mild chronic inflammation in the adipose tissue especially in the VF, with increased secretion of proinflammatory adipocytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6(IL-6), high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), may be the important link connecting visceral adiposity with IR. [ In a nutshell, proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory adipokines and adipocytokines are produced by visceral adipose tissue and their dysregulation lead to chronic low-grade inflammatory state and contribute to the development of IR. [ In our previous study, the Mysore Visceral Adiposity in Diabetes study (MYVAD)[ To find out the levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and hs-CRP in those having visceral adiposity and IR and to know whether they correlate with VF and SCF to establish a causal link for IR. (a) To know whether these cytokines vary in those who have IR compared to those without IR, irrespective of whether they are metabolically obese or not. (b) To ascertain the significance of AN in the causation of IR. AN was higher in females of both obese and nonobese groups ( Pearson's correlation of BMI, WC, SCF, and VF with components metabolic syndrome (earlier study)[ Pearson's correlation of cytokines, with abdominal adiposity, and IR (obese group) In the nonobese group except for TNF-\u03b1, which had a significant correlation with IR in females ( Pearson's correlation of cytokines with abdominal adiposity and IR, (nonobese group) Pearson's correlation of cytokines with HbA1C, SBP, DBP, TC, TG, HDL, and LDL In this study, we have compared obese with nonobese nondiabetics. In our previous study, (MYVAD study) done in 2010,[ Our primary objective was to find out the levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and hs-CRP, in those having abdominal adiposity and IR and to know whether they would correlate with VF and SCF to establish a causal link for IR. There is disagreement among many researchers about the portal theory for the causation of IR. Experiments showing adipose tissue derived proinflammatory cytokine-like TNF-\u03b1, could actually cause IR in experimental models, provided the necessary impetus for further studies. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 and other cytokines appear to participate in the induction and maintenance of chronic sub-acute inflammatory state associated with obesity and activate cellular pathways that produce the development of IR. [ The IR as measured by the HOMA-IR values for normal individuals was 1.35\u20131.96. IL-6 correlated with IR in obese females and TNF-\u03b1 correlated with IR in nonobese females and hs-CRP did not correlate with IR in both groups. TNF-\u03b1, which correlated with VF in obese had no correlation with IR, whereas it correlated with IR in nonobese females but had no correlation with their SCF or VF. IL-6, despite no correlation with either SCF or VF, correlated with IR in obese females. hs-CRP correlated with VF in obese females but had no correlation with their IR. Hence, no causal link could be established between the cytokines, abdominal adiposity, and IR. The secondary objective was to know whether these cytokines vary in those who have had IR compared to those without IR, irrespective of whether they are metabolically obese or not. Since both obese and nonobese males and females showed higher IR values than the normal, there was no group without IR. Nonobese males and females despite having lower VF showed IR; whereas obese males and females had higher VF and higher IR. IL-6 and hs-CR The other objective was to ascertain the significance of AN in the causation of IR. [ This study showed higher than normal values of AN, in women of both groups compared to men ( As far as components of metabolic syndrome and their relationship with cytokines, studies have shown AN correlating positively with HDL and negatively with TG[ This study showed IL-6 correlating positively with SBP and DBP in nonobese males, hs-CRP correlating with LDL in both obese males and females, TNF-\u03b1 correlating with HbA1C in nonobese females and AN not correlating with any parameter in both groups [ This study has shown higher VF and higher IR in males, whether they were obese or not, higher IL-6 and hs-CR The limitation of the study is the size. Even with the number of subjects involved in this study, we expected a causal link or at least a trend, between cytokines, VF, and IR, as shown in many of the studies referred in this study, but unfortunately could not be demonstrated. In this study on South Indian subjects, proinflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and hs-CRP, despite being high, did not show any causal correlation either with abdominal obesity or with IR. Even the anti-inflammatory adipokine, AN did not show any correlation with IR.", "DDR proteins for DSBs in mammalian cells are the kinases ATM/ATR, the sensing complex MRE11-RAD50-NBS1, and CHK2 ( Another method used to detect DSBs and their repair is the comet assay, a rapid and quantitative technique by which damaged or broken pieces of DNA are measured at the level of individual cells ( The identified The L4-stage animals on NGM plates were irradiated using a IR-treated worms were allowed to lay eggs. The gonads of IR-irradiated worm were dissected 1h after irradiation. Comet tails were observed at 1 h after IR ( The tail moments in two assays were different. Glyoxal is known to covalently bind to only solution-exposed guanine bases ( To attain high enough sensitivity under the neutral comet assay, germline nuclei were treated with ribonuclease A and proteinase K to obtain relatively pure DNA free from RNA and most proteins ( DNA damage levels, as measured by tail moment, remained high in When mammalian cells are exposed to IR, aggregates of repair proteins called nuclear foci appear within their nuclei ( We analyzed RAD-51 foci formation over time after exposure to IR. In wild-type N2, the percentage of germline nuclei showing RAD-51-positive foci decreased with increasing post-irradiation time ( IR-induced DSBs in mammalian cells have been also detected by immuno staining of \u03b3-H2AX, which is a marker for DNA strand breaks ( In summary, we have shown that the dissected mitotic germline region can be used for the comet assay in Note: Supplementary information is available on the Molecules and Cells website ( This work was supported by the grant of University of Ulsan (2015) to B.

Worms were irradiated with 30 Gy of IR and postincubated for various recovery times.", "Therefore, the main purpose of the present study was to examine plasma levels of AEA and 2-AG in OSA patients and its possible relationship with OSA and IR. IR was assessed using the homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR). Clinical and biochemical characteristics of OSA group and control group were given in All group's HOMA-IR were shown in Tables Plasma concentrations of AEA and 1/2-AG in all groups were shown in Tables To further investigate the relationship between endocannabinoids and IR, an association has been described. In OSA patients, as can be seen in Figures To further assess relations between HOMA-IR and other measurements in OSA patients, a multiple stepwise regression analysis was performed with HOMA-IR as a dependent variable; age, gender, BMI, waist circumference, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TGs, AHI, mean oxygen saturation, lowest oxygen saturation, oxygen saturation < 90%, AEA, and 2-AG were all included in the regression equation as independent variables. It turned out that HOMA-IR had significant and independent associations with AEA ( Our aim was to examine the association between plasma endocannabinoids and markers of IR in OSA individuals. Results showed that plasma levels of endocannabinoids, especially AEA, were significantly increased in patients with OSA and showed a strong correlation with AHI and HOMA-IR. IR is the hallmark of type 2 diabetes and can eventually lead to the development of type 2 diabetes. It has been proved that the level of IR is associated with the severity of OSA [ Furthermore, we found higher plasma endocannabinoids (AEA and 1/2-AG) concentrations in patients with sleep apnea compared to BMI matched groups. With the increase in AHI, AEA and 1/2-AG concentrations in the blood gradually increased, and circulating AEA, not 1/2-AG, was positively associated with AHI in the OSA individuals after adjusting for age, BMI, waist circumference, lipid, and HOMA-IR. [ Moreover, another finding of our analysis was that circulating concentrations of the endocannabinoids related to IR in OSA patients but not in no-OSA subjects and AEA can predict IR in OSA patients to a certain extent. It has been previously shown that IR is associated with an increase in the concentrations of endocannabinoids [ The main limitation of our study was that the conclusions we got were mainly based on correlation analysis. It reflected only a superficial relationship between OSA severity, IR, and endocannabinoids, and it is far away from clarifying the exact relationship with each other. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out further research to elucidate the role of endocannabinoids in the occurrence and development of IR in OSA patients. In conclusion, the main finding of this study is that the plasma AEA level in patients with OSA increased with severity of the disease and closely correlated with OSA induced IR. The putative IR effect of endocannabinoids in OSA remains to be illuminated. Nevertheless, our analysis may provide new insight into relevant mechanisms in sleep apnea-induced IR, and modulation of endocannabinoids metabolism could be an interesting target for pharmacological treatment of IR of OSA. HOMA-IR in four groups (a) and the relationship between HOMA-IR and AHI in OSA patients (b). The relationship between AEA and HOMA-IR (a), 1/2-AG and HOMA-IR (b).

It was demonstrated that IR radiation substantially enhanced the efficiency of proteolysis and the digestion time was significantly reduced to 5 min. The suitability of IR-assisted on-plate proteolysis to complex proteins was demonstrated by digesting human serum and casein extracted from commercially available milk sample.", "The results indicated that CS supplementation (70 mg/kg) increased the average daily gain (ADG) and serum IGF-I level, upregulated mRNA levels of GHR and IGF-I (liver, stomach, muscle), IGF-IR (stomach, duodenum, muscle), and IGFBP-3 (liver) but downregulated IGFBP-3 (stomach, duodenum, muscle). CS supplementation (70 mg/kg) did not affect mRNA levels of GHR and IGF-I (duodenum), IGF-IR (liver), and IR (liver, stomach, duodenum, muscle). CS supplementation (140 mg/kg) downregulated GHR (duodenum), IGF-I, and IGF-IR mRNA (liver, stomach, duodenum, muscle) but upregulated IGFBP-3 and IR mRNA (liver, stomach, duodenum, muscle) and did not affect ADG and serum IGF-I concentration. Collectively, the results suggest that dietary CS supplementation modulates the growth rate, serum IGF-I concentrations, and the gene expression of GHR, IGF-I, IGF-IR, IGFBP-3, and IR in a dose-dependent manner. CS supplementation has tissue-specific regulation of GHR, IGF-I, IGF-IR, and IGFBP-3 mRNA levels.", "We report here that ban is needed to limit IR-induced apoptosis in larval imaginal discs. Using tubulin-EGFP ban sensors with ban consensus sequences in the 3'UTR, we find that EGFP decreases following IR, indicating that IR activates ban. ban mutant larvae show increased sensitivity to killing by IR, which is suppressed by a mutation in hid. These results can fit into a model in which IR activates ban and ban represses hid to limit IR-induced apoptosis.", "We used model-based hypothesis testing to evaluate three mechanistic explanations for this behavior: (A) phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of IR at the plasma membrane only; (B) the additional possibility for IR endocytosis; (C) the alternative additional possibility of feedback signals to IR from downstream intermediates. Insulin acts on cells by binding to specific insulin receptors (IRs) at the cell surface. This triggers a series of events, including attachment of phosphate to IR, activation of downstream proteins that eventually mediate the signal to specific targets in the cell, and internalization of IR to the inner cytosolic part of the cell. The main conclusion is that either IR internalization and the subsequent recycling back to the cell surface or feedbacks from downstream proteins (or both) must be significantly active during the first few minutes of insulin action. Nevertheless, such data contains valuable information on the active mechanisms in a complex system, and measurements of rapid transient responses is one of the most widely used methods for characterization of technical systems We examined the extent of phosphorylation of IR and IRS1 on tyrosine residues in human adipocytes. In three separate experiments, data were collected at 10 time points during 15 min, following a step increase from 0 to 0.1 (A) shows experimental data for IR and their estimated standard deviations (vertical lines), and the agreement of a model without an overshoot (\u2133 Three hypotheses are considered as possible mechanistic explanations to the observed overshoot. It is interesting to consider the possibility whether such mechanisms might be the only ones significantly active in the IR signaling subsystem, since we are only considering the first few minutes of the response. All discovered model structures corresponding to hypothesis A that give an acceptable agreement with the data include transient state variables such as (IR\u22c5ins)\u22c5PTP (insulin-bound IR in complex with the dephosphorylating phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase). The distinguishing feature of such state variables is that they describe a form of IR that has been dephosphorylated, but that is not yet a part of the original pool of IR. (IR\u22c5ins)\u22c5PTP describes the pool of IR that has been dephosphorylated, but that is still bound to the phosphatase PTP. Another such state could be IR\u22c5ins. However, (IR\u22c5ins)\u22c5PTP is believed to be transient, i.e., short-lived and therefore at any time only making up a small percentage of the total amount of IR (IR The model analysis is based on the transfer function formulation of the model. This is based on previous studies showing that more than 90% of the original pool of receptors remain unphosphorylated We applied this approach to the model structure \u2133 The top left model structure only has states at the membrane, and that means that the last state before IR, (IR\u22c5ins)\u22c5PTP, will have a steady state value of at least 25% of the total receptor concentration. This is unrealistic and \u2133 The outcome of the search for \u2133 (A) Simulations of IR\u22c5P\u22c5ins (solid line) and IR The above analysis shows that some more mechanisms than IR dynamics at the membrane must be significantly active already during the first few minutes of the response. Recall that the models with (IR\u22c5ins)\u22c5PTP are rejected exclusively due to the interpretation of the state variables, and that the model structure as such is capable of explaining the available data. However, our analysis indicates that hypothesis B, inclusion of endocytosis, is only an acceptable explanation if both internalization and recycling of IR to the plasma membrane are included. A rather general model structure that includes internalization and dephosphorylation of IR at both the plasma membrane and in the cytosol is given by \u2133 First we tested this using a While hypothesis B is like A with the additional possibility of endocytosis, hypothesis C is also like A but with the additional possibility of feedbacks from downstream signaling intermediates. The first part reports a rapid overshoot in IR and IRS1 phosphorylation upon insulin stimulation of human fat cells. The second part of the paper analyzes three biologically realistic and plausible mechanistic explanations: (A) direct phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of IR at the plasma membrane only; (B) the additional possibility of IR endocytosis; (C) the alternative additional possibility of feedback to IR from downstream intermediates. Interestingly, a transient overshoot in the phosphorylation of internalized IR has been reported Our statistical testings are based on a number of assumptions. It will be an important step forward in our understanding of these processes when we can measure data containing spatially resolved single cell data, and when we can more realistically describe processes in micro-environments such as caveolae, where IR and IRS1 are situated. For instance, the number of IR proteins per fat cell has been estimated to >2\u00d710 In any case, despite these limitations, statistical assessments of the degree of uncertainty underlying model rejections do provide more detailed and objective statements than those based on simulations and/or subjective judgments alone. The cells were immediately dissolved in SDS and By two-dimensional electrofocusing (pH 3\u201310) - SDS-PAGE analysis and immunoblotting against phosphotyrosine and IRS1, >95% of the tyrosine phosphorylated 180-kD band was determined to represent IRS1 In this paper we evaluate three mechanistic hypotheses for the explanation of experimentally observed phosphorylation dynamics.", "We have found that intracellular generation of nitric oxide (NO) by NO synthase (NOS) is required for the rapid activation of EGFR phosphorylation by IR. Treatment of A549 lung cancer cells with IR increased NOS activity within minutes, accompanied by an increase of NO. 2-Phenyl-4,4,5,5,-tetramethylimidazolline-1-oxyl-3-oxide, an NO scavenger, and NG-monomethyl-l-arginine, an NOS inhibitor, abolished the increase in intracellular NO and activation of EGFR by IR. Transient transfection with small interfering RNA for endothelial NOS reduced IR-induced NO production and suppressed IR-induced EGFR activation. Overexpression of endothelial NOS increased IR-induced NO generation and EGFR activation. These results indicate a novel molecular mechanism for EGFR activation by IR-induced NO production via NOS.", "We examined a birth cohort study of 292 children with measures in the neonatal period (day 4) including subscapular and triceps skinfolds; repeat skinfold measures at age 8, cardiorespiratory (CR) fitness, IR by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) equation (HOMA-IR) and serum triglyceride (TG) concentrations and measures of ACE I/D gene variants. Childhood gain in upper body adiposity was positively associated with HOMA-IR and TG independently of neonatal skinfolds (P < or = 0.02). For example, subscapular skinfold gain was not strongly associated with HOMA-IR or TG among those with II or ID genotype (b = 0.03, P = 0.05; b = 0.02, P = 0.18 respectively) but was positively associated among those with the DD genotype (b = 0.11, P = 0.001; b = 0.08, P = 0.003); difference in effect P = 0.05; P = 0.01 respectively. Upper body fat accumulation during childhood was positively associated with HOMA-IR and TG independently of neonatal skinfolds.", "Phosphatase treatment of EN receptors abolished IR kinase activation implicating beta-subunit autophosphorylation as a mediator of the activation process (Khan, M. N., Baquiran, G., Brule, C., Burgess, J., Foster, B., Bergeron, J. J. M., and Posner, B. I. In the present study, the phosphotyrosine (PY) content of the IR beta-subunit in PM and ENs was estimated by two different methods. In the second method, immunoblotting with antibodies against the submembrane domain of the IR beta-subunit, encompassing residue 960 (alpha 960), and with antibodies against PY (alpha PY) was used to determine the content of PY/beta-subunit in PM and ENs following injection of insulin. By both methods, it was found that the PY content of PM IR was significantly greater than that of IR in ENs. With doses of 1.5 micrograms of insulin/100 g body weight (50% receptor occupancy) or 15 micrograms/100 g body weight (receptor saturation), the PY/beta-subunit of PM IR attained a level 2.0 to 2.5-fold of that observed for the IR of ENs. Surprisingly, the IR of ENs incorporated 3 to 5 times more PY/beta-subunit than those of PM consequent to autophosphorylation. Exogenous IR kinase activity (poly(Glu:Tyr)) in PM changed only slightly with insulin dose. Since Thr12-Lys (IR kinase residues 1142-1153) efficiently inhibited IR autophosphorylation of both PM and EN receptors, Tris phosphorylation of beta-subunit regulatory tyrosines was unlikely. These results may be explicable by a dephosphorylation-dependent activation of IR kinase, as seen with the src family of tyrosine kinases.", "Pretreatment with PME extract or its anthraquinone-containing fraction produced a dose-dependent protection against myocardial IR injury, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the extent of LDH leakage as well as an improvement in contractile force recovery. The myocardial protection was found to be associated with an enhancement in myocardial glutathione antioxidant status, as indicated by significant reductions in both the extent of IR-induced reduced glutathione (GSH) depletion and inhibition of Se-glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione reductase (GRD) activities. Both alpha-tocopherol acetate (VE) and emodin (EMD) pretreatments protected against IR-induced myocardial injury as assessed by the decrease in the extent of LDH leakage. The more complete myocardial protection afforded by the anthraquinone-containing fraction of PME extract may be related to its ability to sustain the glutathione antioxidant status under the condition of IR-induced oxidative stress.", "The use of yeast two-hybrid technology by several laboratories allowed the identification of Grb10 as a potential target of the IR and IGF-IR . The interaction between Grb10 and these receptors is of particular interest because it is independent of the docking proteins insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and IRS-2, which recruit other SH2 domain-containing signalling proteins taking part in IR and IGF-IR signalling cascades . Three groups were able to confirm association between Grb10 and the IR by co-immunoprecipitation analyses by using cell lines transfected with IR constructs and exhibiting endogenous Grb10 expression . However, whether Grb10 associates with the IGF-IR in living cells is more controversial. Morrione reported co-immunoprecipitation of these two proteins; but, in a comparative study by the Smith laboratory using IGF-IR/\u2212 fibroblasts transfected with either the IR or the IGF-IR, only strong association between the IR and Grb10 could be detected . Conflicting results have also been presented for delineation of the Grb10-binding site on the IR. Indeed, these results indicated that Grb10 binds to sites within more than one of the IR subdomains (juxtamembrane, kinase and C terminus). Furthermore, although the SH2 domain was sufficient for Grb10\u2013IR interaction, a further region also may contribute to binding, because the full-length protein bound more strongly than the SH2 domain alone . In the case of the IGF-IR, use of receptor deletion mutants in the two-hybrid system implicated a C-terminal subdomain in Grb10 binding . This methodology has also recently identified the IR (manuscript submitted) and Htk (EphB4) (unpublished results) as potential RTK partners for Grb14. A further example of protein\u2013protein interaction mediated by a PH domain is provided by the work of Yao , who found that the PH domain of Btk bound protein kinase C. More recently, structural studies revealed that the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains of Shc and IRS-1 possess the same fold as that of PH domains . To date, attempts to reveal the function of the Grb7 family in mammalian cells have focussed on the role of Grb10 proteins in signalling by the IR or the IGF-IR. However, the Grb10 SH2 domain exhibits a high affinity for the juxtamembrane and activation loop tyrosine phosphorylation sites of the IR . Consequently, it remains possible that the microinjected SH2 domain blocks the recruitment of IRS-1 and Shc, which bind to the juxtamembrane Tyr960 site through their PTB domains , or their phosphorylation by the IR kinase or both. In support of this possibility, Liu and Roth found that over-expression of hGrb10\u03b2 inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and recruitment of PI3-kinase to the tyrosine phosphorylated protein fraction. Recently Morrione found that over-expression of mGrb10\u03b1 inhibited IGF-I-stimulated, but not insulin, stimulated, proliferation and partly reversed IGF-IR-mediated cell transformation. Alterations in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-IR, IRS-1 and Shc were not detected in the transfected cells, and inhibition of proliferation was not observed in cells expressing a truncated IGF-IR lacking the proposed Grb10 binding site.", "The Shep-1 neuroblastoma cell line is highly resistant to IR. This cell line contains a wild-type p53 gene and is an ideal model for studying the mechanism of IR resistance in this disease. Following high-dose IR, cell fractionation demonstrated that p53 is induced and targeted to the nucleus. The induced p53 is functional as p53-responsive genes (Waf-1 and MDM-2) are appropriately induced following IR. Intriguingly, overexpression of p53 could reverse the inherent IR resistance of Shep-1 cells. Pulse induction of p53 alone did not affect Shep-1 cell viability, while induction of p53, followed by IR, resulted in cell death and DNA fragmentation proportional to the dose of IR and the level of p53 expression. These findings demonstrate that p53 overexpression renders Shep-1 cells IR-sensitive and suggest that large quantities of exogenous p53 can overcome the factors inhibiting p53-mediated, IR-induced apoptosis.", "Hybrid receptors composed of an IR alphabeta-heterodimer and an IGF-IR alphabeta-heterodimer are formed in tissues expressing both molecules. Hybrids behave as IGF-IR rather than IR with respect to ligand binding affinity, receptor autophosphorylation, and hormone internalization and degradation. We recently reported that in skeletal muscle of NIDDM patients, expression of hybrids is increased and correlated with a decrease in IR number and an increase in fasting insulin levels. These results indicate that insulin-induced IR downregulation may lead to the formation of a higher proportion of hybrid receptors, whose abundance is negatively correlated with in vivo insulin sensitivity.", "The effect of IR on rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons was examined in dissociated cell cultures. After exposure to IR, embryonic DRG neurons, established in cell culture for six days, underwent cell death in a manner that was dose-dependent, requiring a minimum of 8 to 16 Gy. Twenty-five per cent cell loss occurred in embryonic day 15 (E-15) neurons, grown in cell culture for 6 days ('immature'), and then treated with 24 Gy IR. In contrast, only 2% cell loss occurred in E-15 neurons maintained in culture for 21 days ('mature') and then treated with 24 Gy IR. Initiation of the apoptosis occurred within 24 h after exposure to IR. Apoptosis induced by IR occurred more frequently in immature than in mature neurons. When treated with high extracellular potassium, these immature neurons were resistant to IR exposure in a manner similar to that observed in mature neurons. These data suggest that [Ca2+]i modulates the apoptotic response of neurons after exposure to IR in a similar manner to that proposed by the \"Ca2+ setpoint hypothesis\" for control of NGF withdrawal-induced apoptosis.", "BHK cells overexpressing five million IR (BHK-IR) respond to insulin with reduced growth and detachment from the dish surface. In this report we describe the effect of several point mutations in PTP alpha on the phosphatase activity and regulation of insulin signaling in BHK-IR cells. We conclude that mutation of the carboxyterminal tyrosine in PTP alpha uncovers a dual function of this phosphatase in BHK cells: reduction of the IR signal and activation of an endogenous kinase.", "For triple staining for VIP-IR, nNOS-IR and NADPH-d activity in the ileal and colonic myenteric plexus ganglia, the immunoreactivities for VIP and nNOS were examined first, using the double staining method described above. Forty-two percent of these neurons were immunoreactive for either nNOS (A, A\u2019) or displayed NADPH-d activity (B, B\u2019) while 45% of nNOS-IR or NADPH-d NCBs were not immunoreactive for VIP (A\u2019, B\u2019). All neurons with nNOS-IR were also reactive for NADPH-d (not shown). Almost all (91%) of the VIP-IR nerve cells in antral myenteric plexus ganglia were also immunoreactive for GAL (), an observation in agreement with earlier studies . These GAL-IR and VIP-IR positive neurons stained strongly for VIP and had circular or oval cell bodies, a single long axon and lacked prominent dendrites (A, A\u2019); morphology consistent with their being motor or inter-neurons (A, a). Representing a smaller population, there were a few VIP-IR neurons which did not contain GAL-IR. These neurons had a more elliptical shape, a greater number of dendrites and frequently were surrounded by baskets of VIP\u2013IR varicosities (a, a\u2019). Nearly all (99%) of GAL containing neurons were also VIP-IR positive. Similarly, 48% of GAL-IR neurons also were immunoreactive for nNOS. Based on the presence of baskets of varicosities of VIP-IR (A, a) and GAL\u2013IR (A\u2019, a\u2019, B\u2019, b\u2019) around NCBs, at least certain of the neurons containing VIP and/or GAL are probably interneurons. Of note, varicosities labelled by nNOS-IR or NADPH-d activity were not located around these neurons. Using the NADPH-d reaction, neurons containing nNOS but negative for VIP-IR were always seen to be present. There was always complete identity of nNOS-IR and NADPH-d reactivity when neurons were compared (B, B\u2019). Twenty-three percent of VIP-IR neurons (A, arrowhead 1) were immunoreactive for VIP-alone; containing neither nNOS-IR (B, arrowhead 2) nor NADPH-d reactivity (C, arrowhead 3). These nNOS containing neurons were better delineated by NADPH-d staining than by NOS-IR (A, B, B\u2019, C\u2019, 4B, C, 5B\u2019). There were distinct populations of large and small nNOS neurons (see A, B, B\u2019, C\u2019, 4B, C, and also in colon, F); the small neurons had fewer dendrites and lacked VIP-IR and GAL-IR. There were many instances in which VIP-IR varicosities formed baskets around myenteric plexus neurons (A\u2019, C; 4A, 5A, a), at times around or near neurons with nNOS-IR or NADPH-d activity (A, A\u2019 or 3C, C\u2019; A, B). In contrast, similar arrangements of nNOS-IR or NADPH-d reactive varicosities were rarely observed (A, B, B\u2019, C\u2019; B, C). A subset (39%) of ileal VIP-IR neurons (A) was also immunoreactive for GAL (A\u2019). Seventy-two percent of GAL-IR neurons (a\u2019) were not immunoreactive for VIP while 61% of VIP-IR neurons were not immunoreactive for Gal (A, A\u2019, 5a, a\u2019). GAL-IR varicosities, similar to the VIP-IR varicosities described above, were frequently present in baskets around myenteric plexus neurons (A\u2019, a\u2019). In certain cases (a, a\u2019), these GAL-IR varicosities were present around or near VIP-IR neurons. Because there were more nNOS-IR than VIP-IR neurons in the ileal myenteric plexus and more VIP-IR than GAL-IR neurons, it could be predicted that little colocalization of GAL-IR with nNOS would occur. While NADPH-d reactivity and nNOS-IR were always colocalized, GAL was only present in 12% of these nNOS containing neurons. Conversely, 63% of GAL-IR neurons contained nNOS. As in the ileum, many more cells possessed NADPH-d activity (or nNOS-IR, see below) compared to cells with VIP-IR. In (D\u2013F), triple colocalization studies of nNOS-IR, VIP-IR and NADPH-d are portrayed. Less than half of VIP-IR NCBs (D) were also immunoreactive for nNOS (E). All neurons reactive to NADPH-d (F) were also immunoreactive for nNOS (E), demonstrating complete identify of nNOS-IR and NADPH-d reactivity. Similarly, only 47% of GAL-IR NCBs contained VIP. In the colon myenteric plexus, both VIP-IR and GAL-IR varicosities appeared to form baskets around other NCBs and certain GAL-IR varicosities were present close to VIP-IR neurons (B, B\u2019) or NADPH-d reactive neurons (C, C\u2019). VIP-IR varicosities also were close to NADPH-d reactive neurons (A, A\u2019). There was little colocalization between neurons with GAL-IR and those with NADPH-d reactivity (C, C\u2019). Of NOS-IR neurons, 12% were also GAL-IR positive and 33% of GAL-IR also contained NOS. This contrasted with the situation in canine antrum where neurons with VIP-IR were present in larger numbers. Fewer NCBs containing nNOS-IR or NADPH-diaphorase were colocalized with GAL-IR in any area (12% in ileum and colon and 33% in antrum). nNOS-IR nerves are the predominant population of inhibitory transmitter-containing neurons in ileum and colon, consistent with a predominant role of NO as an inhibitory transmitter in canine small intestine and colon . A higher proportion of VIP-IR than NOS-IR neurons was present in the canine antrum, from which descending inhibition to the pylorus occurs . Many nerves had VIP-IR without NOS-IR and certain neurons with NOS-IR did not contain VIP. Presumably the large neurons in which VIP- and NOS-IR are colocalized are part of the same cohort of nerves. However, the function and the projections of the small nNOS-IR nerves which do not contain VIP-IR is uncertain at this time. However, we did not find baskets of nNOS-IR varicosities or NADPH-d reactive varicosities around other myenteric plexus neurons. The antibody for nNOS recognizes varicosities poorly in contrast to other antibodies , and although the NADPH-d procedure does label these structures, further study is required using antibodies which strongly labels the axons and endings of NOS-IR nerves. There is uncertainty about the neuronal sources of these peptides since GAL-IR neurons of the pig, as in the dog, are mostly present in the submucosa . In the ileum there is a predominance of nNOS-IR myenteric plexus neurons over VIP-IR and GAL-IR neurons, in contrast to the situation in the antral myenteric plexus.", "The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective function of oxytocin (OT) in remote liver damage triggered by renal IR in rats. The groups were as follows: (1) Sham operated group; (2) Sham operated+OT group (3) Renal IR group; (4) Renal IR+OT group. The results showed that renal IR injury constituted a notable elevation in MDA, TOS, Oxidative stress index (OSI) and significantly decreased TAS, PON-1 actvity and NO in liver tissue (p<0.05). Additionally renal IR provoked significant augmentation in hepatic microscopic damage scores. However, alterations in these biochemical and histopathological indices due to IR injury were attenuated by OT treatment (p<0.05). Liver and kidney are both incorporated in the modulation of body homeostatic functions, metabolism and elimination of drugs and toxic products [ Oxytocin (OT), a neurohypopysial nonapeptide generated in the paraventricular and the supraoptic nuclei in the hypothalamus, exhibits a wide spectrum of central and peripheral activities [ According to these data, this research was planned to explore the potential protective effect of OT against remote liver damage induced by renal IR in rats, by using biochemical and histological arguments. The groups were as follows: (1) Sham operated group; (2) Sham operated+OT group (3) Renal IR group; (4) Renal IR+OT group. The MDA, TOS, TAS, OSI and NO levels and PON-1 enzyme activities in the liver tissues are presented in The histopathological findings are shown in Acute renal failure appears in almost 5% of hospitalized patients and up to 30% of patients in intensive care units [ IR of the tissue was determined to be connected with lipid peroxidation, which is an autocatalytic process causing oxidative demolition of the cellular membranes, and their breakdown can contribute to the generation of toxic, reactive products and cell death [ In our study, we evaluated oxidative status as TOS and TAS along with the measurement of OSI, a pointer of oxidative stress, which reveals the redox balance between oxidation and antioxidation [ PON-1 is an enzyme associated with high-density lipoprotein that is mainly secreted by the liver. Although its physiological function has not been completely clarified, it seems that PON-1 is responsible for hydrolyzing lipid peroxides, also playing a major role in the antioxidant system [ In this research, we revealed decreased PON-1 activity in the liver tissues of IR rats compared to sham operated rats. OT treatment reversed the reduced activity of PON-1 in IR+OT group. These findings demonstrate that a decrease in PON-1 activity is related to oxidative damage in the liver tissues caused by renal IR and OT treatment reverses the decline of PON-1 activity in these tissues. NO has protective effects on cells during IR. In IR group, intense hepatocyte vacuolization, evident sinusoidal dilatation, central vein dilation, Kupffer cell activation and periportal inflammation were observed. These alterations pointed out a severe damage in liver paranchyme, and the impairment of liver tissues in IR group was notably more severe than the IR+OT group. Congestion, hepatocyte vacuolization, sinusoidal dilatation, central vein dilatation, Kupffer cell activation and periportal inflammation are seen in IR group (C) sections. Histopathological alterations that were observed in IR group were significantly improved in IR+OT group (D). cv, central vein; v, vacuoles; kc, Kuppfer cells (inset); asterisk, inflammatory cells (inset); c, congestion; arrows, sinusoidal dilatation; IR, ischemia-reperfusion; OT, oxytocin. Histopathological findings in the different study groups Results are presented as median values IR group was compared with the other groups. IR, ischemia-reperfusion; OT, oxytocin.", "The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of acute and chronic exposure to IR radiation on the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 and on the expression of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in the rabbit cornea and crystalline lens. New Zealand rabbits were subjected to IR radiation for 4 months (chronic exposure to IR) or to normal light (control group). In experiments regarding acute exposure, animals were subjected to IR radiation or normal light for 12 h, in the presence of 0.1% diclofenac sodium (eye drops instilled in the right eye of animals) or saline (instilled in the left eye of animals). Acute or chronic exposure to IR radiation induced the activity of MMP-2 in cornea and lens, whereas only acute IR radiation increased the content of heparan sulphate in crystalline lens. Local administration of diclofenac sodium did not prevent the above effects of acute IR radiation. The detrimental effects of excessive or prolonged exposure of the eyes to IR radiation are associated with induced activity of MMP-2 in cornea and lens and alterations in the content of heparan sulphate in lens. Thus, MMP and GAG may offer alternative targets for pharmacological intervention to confront ocular damages associated with IR radiation.", "They had raised Body Mass Index, hypertension, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, raised C\u2013peptide, dyslipidaemia with raised apo\u2013B and reduced apo\u2013A Strong association of hypertension with serum insulin, IR, C\u2013peptide and TC/HDLc hints significant contribution towards cardiovascular risk in hypothyroid adults of Jodhpur. Thus, the females, though higher in number, did not influence the overall results owing to comparable biochemical profiles [ Biochemical profile based on sex of healthy controls and hypothyroid patients There was a [NS] association of SBP and DBP with various CVD risk factors in HC [ Correlative analysis of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure with potential cardiovascular diseases risk factors in hypothyroid patients Correlative analysis of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure with potential cardiovascular diseases risk factors in healthy controls There was an associated rise of BP and other CVD risk parameters with the severity of hypothyroidism as shown by linear regression of serum TSH with SBP, DBP, HOMA \u2013 IR, TC/HDLc and apo \u2013 B/apo \u2013 A (a) Correlation of serum TSH with SBP in Hypothyroid patients. (c) Correlation of serum TSH with HOMA \u2013 IR in hypothyroid patients. According to an estimate, approximately 25\u201347% of patients with hypertension present with IR or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). [ The dyslipidaemia in the hypothyroid patients worsens by an associated IR,[ A strong association of HOMA-IR in hypothyroidism with serum lipids like TC, TG, LDLc, HDLc and apo \u2013 B in the hypothyroid patients adds up to their risk of CVDs. [ The correlation of SBP and DBP with insulin and IR in the hypothyroid patients of the current study suggests a rise in both, with the deterioration of the IR state in hypothyroidism, probably due to the volume \u2013 dependent hypertension. [ An association of SBP and DBP with C\u2013peptide in these hypothyroid patients further indicates rise of both SBP and DBP with progressing hypothyroidism and emphasizes the enhanced risk of CVD due to IR with a deteriorating state of hypothyroidism. The study suggested that a routine screening of the newly diagnosed hypothyroid patients, not only traditional lipid profile but also FBS, insulin, IR, C \u2013 peptide, apo \u2013 B and A The study provides important correlative data of various biochemical parameters and hypertension in the hypothyroid patients; however we included only the overt hypothyroid patients and left out subclinical hypothyroids (SCHs), which form a very important chunk of the thyroid disorder patients.", "Rats developed liver steatosis associated with moderate liver injury when fed the 30% lipid diets, in spite of the absence of overt obesity or IR, except when fed the lard 30% lipid diet. The lard 30% lipid diet led to IR without modifying the muscle lipid content.", "In this study, we investigated the effects of the treatment with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (SB) and/or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on the hematoimmune damage induced by IR in a mouse model. Some patients receiving radiotherapy might develop both acute and long-term myelosuppression The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) pathway can be activated in response to a variety of extracelluar stimuli, particularly to cellular stress such as osmotic shock, hypoxia, and IR Male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Vital River (Beijing, China) and housed in the certified animal facility at the Institute of Radiation Medicine of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS). The data were analyzed by Student\u2019s Hematopoietic cells are highly sensitive to IR and their injury is the primary cause of death after exposure to a dose of TBI in the range of 4\u201310Gy Mice were treated with ip injection of vehicle (V), SB 203580 (SB), G-CSF (CSF), or both (C+S) after exposure to 6Gy TBI as described in the Methods. Exposure to high doses of IR can cause long-term hematopoietic injury in part via induction of HSC senescence. In this study, we examined the effects of p38 inhibition with SB in combination with G-CSF on IR-induced acute and long-term hematopoietic injury. This is because it has been shown that treatment with G-CSF can ameliorate neutropenia induced not only by chemotherapy but also by radiotherapy In a preliminary study, we found that IR and G-CSF can activate p38 in BM Lin- cells enriched with HSCs and HPCs and the activation can be abrogated by incubation of the cells with SB, a specific p38 inhibitor ( IR can also cause serious damage to the immune system. In our study, the immune organ coefficients, a commonly used indicator of immune suppression, in IR mice were significantly lower than those in control mice at 10d and 30d post TBI. This may be attributable to p38 inhibition mediated suppression of IR-induced HSC senescence as shown before (TIF) Click here for additional data file.", "DSB sensing and processing proteins induced by IR can be observed by immunofluorescence and are referred to as IR-induced foci (IRIF) . IRIF contain many proteins involved in ongoing repair or checkpoint control, such as \u03b3H2AX, 53BP1, ATM, RAD51, Chk2 and ATF2 . H2AX is phosphorylated on serine 139 (\u03b3H2AX) post IR near sites of DSB, leading to the chromatin structure modification to facilitate further DSB repair and recruit other downstream proteins. On the other hand, two histone deacetylases, HDAC1 and SIRT1, were reported to deacetylate Smad7 , which form a feedback loop and may co-ordinate with Smad7 to remodel chromatin structure. Studies revealed that MDC1 and phospho-Ser1981-ATM (pATM) were present and co-localized with \u03b3-H2AX in IR-induced MN , however others found that co-localization of pATM with \u03b3H2AX was rarely detected in both normal cells and tumor cells . In this study we tested the possibility of Smad7 and pSmad2 occurrences in MN, one of the genotoxic endpoints caused by IR and in our study particularly by high LET radiation. We tested the frequency of MN formed after IR in three cell lines: two non-malignant cell lines, human esophageal epithelial cells (referred as EPC) and human fibroblasts (82-6), as well as malignant tumor cells, human prostate cancer cells (PC3). Most IR- induced MN are considered to be the result of unrepaired DSB. In this study we provide evidence that besides \u03b3H2AX, Smad7 foci are also present in spontaneous or IR-induced MN. Since IR, particularly high LET radiation produces a large amount of ROS, which in turn triggers TGF\u03b2 signaling, the co-localization of Smad7 with \u03b3H2AX supports our findings. IR-induced DSBs trigger sensors and adapters/transducers to assemble multi-protein networks for posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation and ubiquitylation . A balance between acetylation and ubiquitylation has been reported to affect the stability of Smad7 , which suggests Smad7 is involved in chromatin restructuring caused by IR, affecting gene transcription targeted by TGF\u03b2 or other factors. One interesting observation is that unlike Smad7, one of the Smad family members, pSmad2, did not appear in MN induced by IR. In our previous results , pSmad2 forms IRIF at relatively later time points after 1Gy of IR, suggesting that pSmad2 is not one of the initial proteins to accumulate at the sites of DSB, and instead is recruited as an adapter protein in an ATM-dependent pathway. The frequency of MN with \u03b3H2AX or Smad7 foci 24h after IR significantly increased compared to MN without \u03b3H2AX or Smad7 foci in PC3 cells, which is in agreement with the observation from Neumann's study . Taken together, our results suggest that besides the well known DSB marker \u03b3H2AX, Smad7 foci are present in spontaneous or IR-induced MN. Smad7, long believed as a potential oncogene, serves as an important factor in IR-induced MN, and the possible candidates for the mechanisms of its presence in MN may include DNA damage and repair, transcriptional regulation and apoptosis post IR exposure.", "Following avertin anesthesia, a thoracotomy was performed, the aorta cannulated Studies involving hexamethonium were independently controlled and the following experimental protocols were observed: (iv) IR injury: 25 min normoxic perfusion, 35 min global ischemia, 60 min reperfusion.

Following experimental protocols, hearts were TTC stained and imaged as previously described to quantify infarct size ( Following avertin anesthesia, the aorta was cannulated Myocytes were equilibrated at a concentration of 10 Mitochondria were isolated from 3 mouse hearts as previously described ( Following IR protocols as described above, hearts were perfused with 10 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4 at 25 \u00b0C) for 3 min at 4 ml/min. Control hearts not exposed to IR injury were cannulated and perfused with PBS. Statistical significance ( Previously we showed that cardioprotection by both IPC and APC in intact hearts is SLO1 independent ( Traces are shown for wild-type (WT) and Perfused FVB littermate WT (white symbols) and Myocytes were isolated from adult littermate WT (white) and To directly test whether NS1619 and NS11021 were able to activate BK channels in isolated mitochondria, a modified thallium ( Mitochondria were isolated from littermate WT (white) and So far, our data show that SLO1 is not required for protection by NS1619 and NS11021 in isolated cardiomyocytes ( (A, B): Perfused FVB mouse hearts from WT animals were subjected to IR injury. No differences in AChE staining were found between control, IR, and IR + NS1619 hearts, suggesting the acute time frame of IR injury in this model was not sufficient to precipitate neuronal loss ( Perfused FVB mouse hearts from WT animals were subjected to IR injury. Panels A\u2013C show representative total heart histochemical acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining following (A) control perfusion, (B) IR injury and (C) IR with NS1619 pre-treatment. (D): Functional activity of cardiac neurons was determined following the six IR protocols used in (A): In isolated cardiomyocytes the NS compounds induce cardioprotection independent of SLO1. This explains the lack of ability of NS1619/NS11021 to protect the intact Together, the current data suggest that the SLO1 openers NS1619 and NS11021 act to preserve intrinsic cardiac neuronal function in IR injury, in a Although the chemical structures of NS1619 and NS11021 are quite diverse, an inactive analog of NS11021 (NS13558) does not elicit cardioprotection ( The data in Overall, the most logical explanation for these data is that NS1619 protection proceeds via SLO1 in cardiac neurons.", "Taken together, our data suggested that TFAM plays a crucial role in regulating mtDNA amplification and mitochondrial biogenesis under IR conditions. Our data showed that mitochondrial biogenesis is induced after \u03b1-particle irradiation in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, and demonstrated that TFAM regulates this IR-induced mitochondrial biogenesis. ( Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate kinase/protein kinase B Influence of PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 on IR-induced TFAM upregulation. The expression of phosphorylated Akt (Ser It has been widely accepted that IR has detrimental effects on nuclear DNA, which may lead to cell death and tumorigenesis. However, extra-nuclear parts that cannot avoid being targeted by IR have not drawn enough attention until recent years. Furthermore, our data indicate that TFAM is a key regulator of IR-induced mitochondrial biogenesis. These \ufb01ndings suggest that under IR conditions, TFAM plays a crucial role in the signaling pathways regulating mtDNA amplification and mitochondrial biogenesis.", "To complement our previous analysis of IR-induced temporal dynamics of nuclear phosphoproteome, we now identify a range of human nuclear proteins that are dynamically regulated by acetylation, and predominantly deacetylation, during IR-induced DDR by using mass spectrometry-based proteomic approaches. Apart from cataloging acetylation sites through SILAC proteomic analyses before IR and at 5 and 60 min after IR exposure of U2OS cells, we report that: (1) key components of the transcriptional machinery, such as EP300 and CREBBP, are dynamically acetylated; (2) that nuclear acetyltransferases themselves are regulated, not on the protein abundance level, but by (de)acetylation; and (3) that the recently reported p53 co-activator and methyltransferase MLL3 is acetylated on five lysines during the DDR.", "Here we investigated deregulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, as an important component of the tumor microenvironment, by the combined treatment modality of IR with the clinically relevant MSA patupilone. Expression, secretion and activity of MMPs and related tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) were determined in cell extracts and conditioned media derived from human fibrosarcoma HT1080 and human glioblastoma U251 tumor cells in response to treatment with IR and the MSA patupilone. IR enhanced the activity of secreted MMPs up to 2-fold and cellular pretreatment with low dose patupilone (0.05-0.2 nM) counteracted specifically the IR-induced MMP activity. The cell invasive capacity of HT1080 and U251 cells was increased after irradiation with 2 Gy by 30% and 50%, respectively, and patupilone treatment completely abrogated IR-induced cell invasion. Furthermore, siRNA depletion of TIMP-1 or TIMP-2 prevented IR-mediated induction of MMP activity and cell invasion. These results indicate that patupilone counteracts an IR-induced MMP activation process by the reduction of secreted TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 proteins, which are required for activation of MMPs. Since IR-induced MMP activity could contribute to tumor progression, treatment combination of IR with patupilone might be of great clinical benefit for tumor therapy. MMPs play an important role in cell survival, apoptosis, angiogenesis, matrix remodelling and metastasis and are regulated at several levels including transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms and by endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) [ Here we investigated the effect of patupilone and IR on MMP function The human fibrosarcoma cells HT1080 (ATCC No CCL-121) were grown in IMDM media. Cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO To prepare conditioned cell culture media (CM) cells were pretreated with or without patupilone for 24 h and sham-treated or irradiated with the indicated doses of IR. A comparison between the groups was performed using To investigate the impact of IR and patupilone on secreted MMP activity, we determined the MMP activity in conditioned cell culture media (CM) derived from the human fibrosarcoma tumor cell line HT1080 24 h after treatment with IR and patupilone. A significant, dose-dependent increase of secreted MMP activity was observed after irradiation with 2 and 10 Gy of IR (1.15-fold; p < 0.01 and 2 fold; p < 0.001, respectively). Interestingly, pretreatment of cells with 0.2 nM patupilone completely abolished the IR-induced increase of MMP activity after 2 Gy and counteracted the irradiation-induced increase of MMP activity by 40% after 10 Gy of IR (p < 0.0001) (Figure Long-term clonogenic survival of the HT1080 cells was determined after treatment with increasing doses of IR and patupilone (Figure To evaluate interference of patupilone and IR with MMP transcription, quantitative RT-PCR was performed with mRNA derived from HT1080 cells treated with 0.2 nM patupilone and IR (2 and 10 Gy), alone and in combination. A small but significant dose dependent-increase of MMP-2, -9 and \u221214- transcription (P = 0.002; P = 0.04-0.008; P = 0.0006, respectively) was induced by IR as determined 24 h after irradiation. Cellular pretreatment with patupilone altered neither the basal level of MMP transcription nor the level of IR-enhanced transcription (Figure To determine interference of patupilone with MMP transcription by other known inducers of MMP-activity, cells were treated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), a strong transcriptional inducer of MMPs [ Irradiation and patupilone-treatment might affect protein expression or secretion of matrix metalloproteinases. Since irradiation of HT1080 cells with 2 Gy only minimally increased MMP activity (Figure MMP activity is regulated on multiple levels, including proteolytic activation, secretion and interaction with inhibitory factors [ Next, we assessed protein levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in cell lysates and CM derived from the HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, which were treated with IR and patupilone. In response to irradiation both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 protein levels were increased in cell lysates and to a higher extent in CM derived from irradiated fibrosarcoma cells when compared to cell lysates and CM derived from control cells (Figure To directly assess the role of TIMPs in the IR-dependent MMP activation process, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were downregulated in HT1080 cells with siRNA directed against the respective TIMP (Figure Additional experiments were perfomed using control (goat IgG) and TIMP-2-directed neutralizing antibodies to confirm the putative regulatory effect of TIMP-2 on the IR-induced MMP-activity. These antibodies were supplemented to the cell culture media during the whole course of the treatment with IR and patupilone and to the serum free cell culture media after irradiation. TIMP-2-directed neutralizing antibodies significantly suppressed IR-dependent upregulation of MMP-activity (P = 0.007), to an extent as observed by siRNA-mediated TIMP-2 depletion or by patupilone-pretreatment prior to irradiation alone (see above). Pretreatment of TIMP-depleted cells with patupilone did not result in an additive, counteractive effect with TIMP-directed neutralizing antibodies (Figure Thus, extracellular exposure to anti-TIMP-2-directed antibodies had the same neutralizing effect on IR-induced upregulation of MMP activity as siRNA-based depletion of TIMP-1 or TIMP-2, suggesting that TIMP-2 interferes with the MMP-activation process at the extracellular site. Overall, these data indicate that patupilone counteracts IR-upregulated MMP-activity through interference with the TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 protein levels and that it is rather the activating than the inhibitory function of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 that is involved in the IR-dependent enhancement of MMP-activity. Therefore, the invasive capacity of HT1080 cells was determined after treatment with patupilone and IR, alone and in combination, using a Transwell invasion assay. Irradiation with 2 Gy resulted in an increased invasive capacity of HT1080 by 50%, (P < 0.0001) and most importantly, pretreatment of cells with patupilone completely abrogated IR-increased cell invasion (P = 0.0004; Figure Depletion of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 specifically counteracted IR-dependent upregulation of MMP-activity in the CM (Figure To exclude a cell-line specific effect, matrix metalloproteinase activity and the invasive capacity were also determined in U251 human glioma cells after treatment with patupilone and IR alone and in combination. These experiments were performed at a concentration of patupilone (0.05 nM), that did not reduce clonogenicity of these cells and only minimally sensitized U251 cells to IR, and thus, corresponding to an equipotent concentration of patupilone as used for HT1080 cells (Figures Here we investigated the regulation of tumor cell-secreted matrix metalloproteinases in response to treatment with the promising combined treatment modality of IR with the clinically relevant MSA patupilone. To our best knowledge we demonstrated for the first time that a microtubule stabilizing agent counteracts IR-enhanced MMP activity and abrogates IR-induced tumor cell invasion. Patupilone did not alter IR-induced transcription of MMPs and TIMPs and did not influence intracellular and extracellular protein levels of MMPs. Interestingly though, patupilone counteracted the IR-enhanced cell invasive capacity via reduction of extracellular TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 protein levels, which are required for MMP-activation. MMP inhibition represents an interesting strategy for combined treatment with IR, as successfully demonstrated by Kalinski et al. IR-enhanced cell invasion was mainly observed after irradiation with low doses of IR up to 2 Gy. This is most probably due to the concomitant IR-induced cytotoxicity at higher doses, which renders it difficult to differentiate between the two opposing processes. A major reason for poor prognosis is extensive infiltration of surrounding brain tissue by tumor cells and the blood\u2013brain barrier as an obstacle for the adequate delivery of cytotoxic agents [ Previous investigations revealed additive cytotoxicity of IR with the microtubule stabilizing agent patupilone The authors declare that they have no competing interests. Proliferative activity of HT1080 cells 24 h after treatment with patupilone, IR and in combination. In case of the combined treatment the cells were treated with patupilone (0.2 nM) 24 h prior to IR (10 Gy). Proliferative activity was measured with the MTT-like Alamar Blue colorimetric proliferation assay 24 hours after IR. A, MMP-1 and \u22123 mRNA levels were determined using qRT-PCR in HT1080 cells treated with 0.2 nM patupilone 24 h prior to IR (10 Gy). The cells were treated with 0.2 nM patupilone 24 h before 10 Gy IR or application of 40 mg/ml PMA.", "IRS1 plays a central role in cancer cell proliferation, its expression is increased in many human malignancies and its up-regulation mediates resistance to anti-cancer drugs. IRS2 is associated with cancer cell motility and metastasis. Currently there are no anti-cancer agents that target IRS1/2. We present new IGF1R/IRS-targeted agents (NT compounds) that promote inhibitory Ser-phosphorylation and degradation of IRS1 and IRS2. Elimination of IRS1/2 results in long-term inhibition of IRS1/2-mediated signaling. The therapeutic significance of this inhibition in cancer cells was demonstrated while unraveling a novel mechanism of resistance to B-RAF The IGF1R signaling pathway is pivotal in many human malignancies ( The role of IRS proteins in human malignancies has been established: overexpression of IRS1/2 causes cell transformation ( The prominent role of IRS proteins in cancer initiation, progression and metastasis, as well as in acquired drug resistance, establishes them as potential targets for novel anti-cancer drugs. Here we present and characterize a unique family of small molecules that lead to Ser-phosphorylation and destruction of IRS1 and IRS2. The elimination of IRS1/2 results in long-term inhibition of IGF1R signaling and powerful inhibition of tumor cell growth. The following primers were used: HuPO: forward 5'-GCTTCCTGGAGGGTGTCC-3', reverse 5'-GGACTCGTTTGTACCCGTTG; IRS1: forward 5'-CTTCTGTCAGGTGTCCATCC-3', reverse 5'-CTCTGCAGCAATGCCTGTTC-3' ; IRS2: forward 5'-ACAATGGTGACTACACCGAG-3', reverse 5'-CTGCTTTTCCTGAGAGAGAC-3' Athymic Nude-nu mice were used for the in vivo studies described in A375SM cells were injected i.v. These compounds, represented by NT52, NT75, NT157 and NT205 ( The inhibitory Ser-phosphorylation of IRS1/2 led to the suppression of signaling to PKB in A375 human melanoma cells ( IRS1/2 Ser-phosphorylation increased with time ( In fact, the targeting of IRS1/2 for Ser-phosphorylation and proteasome-dependent degradation is the major cellular mechanism for shutting off IGF1R signaling ( The elimination of IRS1/2 is a key feature of the NT compounds. The depletion of IRS1/2 from cancer cells should lead to the inhibition of all signals transmitted through IRS proteins. Indeed, the effects of the NT compounds on IRS1/2 were IGF1-independent ( The NT compounds constitute a highly defined family of chemical entities ( We studied the mechanism of NT action in A375 melanoma cells, with NT157 as the lead compound. We found that concomitant to the detachment of IRS1/2 from the receptor, NT157 induced an increased interaction of IGF1R with the adaptor protein Shc ( We propose a model ( We determined the effect of the NT inhibitors on tumor growth and metastasis in mice. Neither did PLX4032 affect IRS1/2 ( Next we tested the relative levels of IRS1 in the PLX4032-resistant cell lines: 451-Lu-BR and Mel1617-BR. Remarkably, we found a significant increase in the levels of IRS proteins in both cell lines, compared with the levels of IRS proteins in the corresponding parental melanoma lines, which are sensitive to mutant B-RAF inhibition ( In PLX4032-resistant 451-Lu-BR cells NT157 induced striking Ser-phosphorylation of IRS1/2, inhibited signaling to PKB, and led to cell death ( We have discovered an exceptional family of IGF1R-IRS1/2 inhibitors. This is brought about by the Ser-phosphorylation and the degradation of IRS1/2, resulting in long-lasting inhibition of signaling to PKB, and leading to cancer cell death. The anti-cancer activity of NT compounds on both IRS1 and IRS2 is highly effective, because IRS1 promotes tumor growth and IRS2 promotes metastasis. Furthermore, inhibition of both IRS proteins precludes the compensation of one for the other. Importantly, we showed that a short exposure to NT compounds sufficed to induce Ser-phosphorylation of IRS1/2, directing IRS1/2 to degradation, even after the removal of the inhibitors. Moreover, the NT157-induced Ser-phosphorylation of IRS1/2 in A375 tumor cells in mice persisted for at least 48 hrs following the administration of the drug. IR is highly homologous to IGF1R in structure and function. by using monoclonal antibodies, can result in compensatory activation of IR by IGF2, leading to drug resistance ( It has been previously shown that in some cases of melanoma IGF1R is up-regulated, leading to enhanced signaling through IRS proteins ( We thank Dr. Shoshana Klein from our laboratory for advice and editing, Prof. Yoel Kloog from Tel Aviv University for kindly providing us with FTS, Dr. Gideon Bollag from Plexxikon for providing us with PLX4032, Prof. Ruth Halaban (Yale University) and Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer as the source of the melanoma cells, and Dr. Michal Lotem (Hadassah Hospital) for providing us the patient-derived melanoma cell lines and with the normal cells. ( ( ( In human melanoma A375 cells, where B-RAF is constitutively active, IGF1R signals mainly through the IRS1/2-PKB axis, inducing cellular survival and proliferation. NT157 binds to an allosteric site on IGF1R and induces a conformational change, leading to the dissociation of IRS1/2 from the receptor (I).", "In the end, we found that 51 proteins can form IR- and/or HO-induced foci colocalizing with Rad52-mCherry foci in DY817 background, and these were deemed the final hits of our screen ( ). A human homolog of Atf1 is an ATM substrate and forms IR-induced foci .", "Male F344 rats fed a high-fat (HF) diet promoting colon carcinogenesis and IR, were induced with DMH (100 mg/kg \u00d7 2 times).", "Insulin aspart B10 (B10Asp human insulin) (AspB10), the only insulin analogue with proven carcinogenic activity, has a greater affinity for IGF1R and IR, and a prolonged IR occupancy time. Male Wistar rats were injected s.c. with human insulin or insulin analogue at doses of 1 to 200 U/kg, and the effects on blood glucose and the phosphorylation status of IR, IGF1R, Akt and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 in muscle, fat, liver and heart samples were investigated. Glargine treatment resulted in phosphorylation levels of IR and Akt that were comparable with those achieved with human insulin, although delayed in time in some tissues. AspB10 treatment resulted in at least twofold higher phosphorylation levels and significantly longer duration of IR and Akt phosphorylation in most tissues. The IR signalling pattern of AspB10 in vivo is distinctly different from that of human insulin and insulin glargine, and might challenge the notion that activation of IGF1R plays a role in the observed carcinogenic effect of AspB10. The dissolution process is followed by rapid proteolytic degradation of parent glargine, leading to soluble metabolites as demonstrated in metabolism studies in humans, rats and dogs [ Insulin glargine has an in vitro IR signalling and metabolic profile comparable to that of human insulin, but displays a slightly greater IGF1R affinity in vitro [ The aim of this study was to analyse the time\u2013action profile of glargine in responsive tissues of rats with respect to pharmacological and signalling variables and to compare that profile to those of human insulin and AspB10, using therapeutic as well as suprapharmacological doses. In the first study, rats ( In a second study, rats ( In a third study, the effects on IR and IGF1R phosphorylation in mammary tissue were examined in 74-week-old female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (Charles River). The time course of IR phosphorylation in skeletal muscle, liver and fat tissue was examined following s.c. injection of 1 U/kg human insulin, glargine or AspB10. ( The effect of increasing suprapharmacological doses of human insulin, glargine and AspB10 on IR and Akt phosphorylation in muscle was examined 60 min after s.c. injection, at a time when similar glucose-lowering effects were observed with each insulin. Each insulin increased IR and Akt phosphorylation, with no significant difference between them detectable (Fig. As a control to demonstrate an IGF-1 effect on IGF1R and downstream signalling, des[1-3]IGF-1 was injected and the phosphorylation of IGF1R, IR and Akt was determined (Fig. ( Given that patients with diabetes often require life-long insulin treatment, it is essential to examine all steps in the action of an insulin analogue in vitro and in vivo, to exclude unwanted effects like growth-promoting activities [ As cancer cells have aberrant IR and IGF1R signalling patterns, it is important to understand how insulin analogues affect normal and cancerous cells, as this has implications for diabetes, cancer and cancer treatment. In contrast, glucose lowering was delayed with insulin glargine, as expected for a long-acting insulin analogue, where the mode of action involves precipitation and subsequent slow release from the tissue depot [ Peak IR and Akt phosphorylation levels induced by insulin glargine were generally comparable with those achieved with human insulin, although in some tissues the effects of insulin glargine were delayed and (or) prolonged in time. We conclude that in rats AspB10 has a different IR signalling profile to that of insulin and insulin glargine, and that the slightly elevated IGF1R activity of AspB10 in vitro did not translate into IGF1R phosphorylation in vivo. Consequently, we hypothesise that the greater mitogenic effect of AspB10 is most likely to be based on its altered IR profile in vivo. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the greater mitogenic effects of insulin and insulin analogues are solely based on the growth-promoting activity of the IR itself, and that IGF1R activation by insulin analogues may be less relevant under therapeutic conditions than previously discussed. Values are mean \u00b1 SEM ( Muscle IR and IGF1R phosphorylation 5 minutes after i.v.", "Although DSBs are suitable substrates for both homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), DSBs resulting from replication fork collapse are preferentially repaired by HR, whereas those induced by IR and ETOP are mostly addressed by NHEJ (; ). In contrast, HR is able to compensate to some degree for the repair of IR-induced DSBs in NHEJ mutant cells during late S/G2 phase (; ). Consistent with impaired DNA end resection, we detected a clear reduction in IR-induced phosphorylation of RPA2 at S4/S8 after transient overexpression of PIN1-wt compared to mock-transfected cells or to cells overexpressing PIN1-W34A (F and G). To this end, we exposed late S/G2 cells stably expressing either CtIP-wt or CtIP-2A to IR and measured the extent of DSB resection by monitoring the levels of hyperphosphorylated RPA2. IR was given using a Faxitron X-ray machine.", "Consistent with this notion, we found that both U2OS and HCT116 cells expressed \u223c10\u201320-fold more of the truncated Wip1 compared with the FL-Wip1 ( Despite the fact that U2OS and HCT116 contain wild-type p53, they fail to arrest in G1 in response to IR and preferentially arrest in the G2 checkpoint that remains intact ( We conclude that cells with mutations that enhance Wip1 protein stability are unable to engage p53 function, fail to arrest in G1 after DNA damage, and progress to S phase.

RESULTS Skeletal muscle IR induced significantly increased plasma CK-MB level (P<0.05) and the levels of MPO, TNF-\u03b1, and MDA in the plasma and myocardium, and significantly decreased plasma and myocardial levels of T-SOD and CuZn-SOD (P<0.05). NaHS treatment significantly decreased plasma CK-MB level (P<0.05), reduced plasma and myocardial levels of MPO, TNF-\u03b1, and MDA, and increased plasma and myocardial T-SOD and CuZn-SOD in rats with IR (P<0.05), whereas PPG treatment did not produce any obvious responses (P>0.05). Immunohistochemistry showed an obviously reduced expression of TNF-\u03b1 in the myocardium in rats with NaHS treatment compared with those in IR group. H\u2082S treatment can alleviate myocardial injury induced by skeletal muscle IR in rats by inhibiting the inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress.", "While a number of known endogenous substrates such as IRS-I, IRS-2 and Shc are utilized by both receptors, the structural differences in the ]l subunits of the two receptors has lead investigators to suggest that certain substrates may be unique to each receptor. Most of the creas controls metabolic processes by interacting with functions of both IGF-I and IGF-II are mediated via specific insulin receptors particulary in liver, muscle and the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) [4]. few cell lines lack the IGF-IR, those that do demonstrate a mitogen response that is mediated via the lR [8, 9]. Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), IRS-2 and Shc are major B1 substrates for both receptors, and the activation of MAP kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3' kinase (PI-3' kinase) A21 has been implicated in both pathways [4, 10, 11]. These findings have led many investigators to suggest that the IR and IGF-IR are indeed redundant and the only difference in the ligand-stimulated physiological response [ NS U L[ N PRO[ NSU/1 N is the relative expression of each receptor in different tissues. For example, the liver expresses only the IR, and fat cells express mainly IR; therefore, these tissues have metabolic responses following ligand binding.

In contrast, the IR chimera with the plots are typically linear, suggesting neither negative nor cysteine-rich domain of the IGF-IR gained high affinity positive cooperativity [4]. Since the IR and IGF-IR have binding for IGF-I, while retaining its affinity for insulin, similar tertiary protein structures, as do the ligands them- These results were interpreted as demonstrating that the selves, it was initially unclear as to what mechanisms were cysteine-rich domain of the IGF-IR was essential, though involved in the ligand receptor specificities. However, the probably not sufficient, for high- affinity IGF binding, results obtained using the ~-subunit-chimeras, described Regarding the IR sequences, both N- and C-terminal above, may explain the initial paradox. More extensive analyses of the IR ~-subunit BINDING OF THE IGFs TO THE IGFBPs have found that amino acids 38-68 contain this high- affinity binding site and that residues Phe-39, Arg-41 and The interaction of IGF-I and IGF-II with the IGF-IR Pro-42 are major contributors to this interaction. When is tightly controlled by the family of insulin-like growth these residues were introduced into the equivalent site of factor binding proteins (IGFBPs), of which there are the IGF-IR, the affinity for insulin markedly increased, six well-characterized members [2, 28].

Binding of the ligands to chimeric receptors revealed that the cysteine-rich domain of the IGF-IR is essential for high-affinity IGF-I binding. In contrast, both N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the IR are required for high affinity insulin binding, in particular the region between amino acids 38 and 68 is particulary important for this effect on insulin binding.When residues Phe-39, Arg-41 and Pro-42 were introduced into the IGF-IR, insulin binding to the IGF-lR was markedly enhanced.

How distinct are the proto-oncogene product c-Crk associates with IRS-I and 4PS: modulation by IGF-1 and enhanced IGF-I signaling.", "Previous work has shown that upon internalization, rat hepatic endosomal IRs manifest increased autophosphorylating and exogenous tyrosine kinase activity compared to IRs located at the plasma membrane. As this period of enhanced activity is associated with reduced endosomal IR beta-subunit phosphotyrosine content, it has been proposed that partial dephosphorylation of the internalized IR beta-subunit by an endosomally located phosphotyrosine phosphatase(s) [PTPase(s)] mediates this effect. To test whether endosomal PTPase activity was required for internalization-dependent augmentation of IR tyrosine kinase activity, the present study used the peroxovanadium PTPase inhibitor, bisperoxo(1,10-phenanthroline)oxovanadate anion [bpV(phen)], to block IR dephosphorylation within this subcellular compartment. bpV(phen) inhibited the dephosphorylation of 32P-labeled hepatic endosomal IR by approximately 97% at 15 min post-bpV(phen) injection and prevented a decrease in IR beta-subunit phosphotyrosine content after IR internalization. Fifteen-minute bpV(phen) pretreatment produced a significant reduction (75%; P < 0.001) in maximal insulin-stimulated endosomal IR exogenous kinase activity and decreased IR autophosphorylating activity by 4.3-fold in this subcellular fraction. In conclusion, these findings suggest that an hepatic endosomal PTPase(s) regulates internalization-dependent increases in IR exogenous tyrosine kinase activity.", "These molecules have been local concentration of TNF at the cell surface, thereby Inhibition of IR Signaling by TNF 163 making more TNF available to bind the p60 receptor ondary changes that contributes to the increase in insulin which is responsible for transducing the TNF signal, resistance. The early intracellular signaling events linking to the inhibition of insulin signaling by TNF [34, 43, 46, the IR to GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in 110]. The IR is a heterotetrameric protein composed of mediating the insulin resistance induced by TNF. Ligand binding to the alpha subunit OF NIDDM results in autophosphorylation of the IR beta subunit and activation of the intrinsic tyrosine domain. The tyrosine Insulin maintains blood glucose homeostasis by both kinase is critical for the IR to signal cells; any impairment stimulating glucose uptake into insulin- sensitive fat and of the tyrosine kinase leads to a decreased ability of the muscle cells and by suppressing glucose production by receptor to stimulate cell growth and metabolic functions, hepatocytes [2, 5, 48]. into peripheral tissues by stimulating the translocation Once activated, the IR associates with and tyrosine of a specialized glucose transporter, GLUT4, from an phosphorylates a variety ofcytosolic signaling molecules intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane [6, in the cell. IR substrates (IRS) 1 and 2 are two of the 7]. Only adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and cardiac the IR and the insulinqike growth factor (IGF-I) receptor tissue express GLUT4 and, as a result, these tissues are [52, 55]. IRS-1 and 2 contain over 20 potential tyrosine primarily responsibleforinsulin-stimulatedregulationof phosphorylation sites and over 30 potential serine/ blood glucose levels in the post- absorptive state. Many of the tyrosine that skeletal muscle accounts for the removal of > 80% phosphorylation sites on IRS-1,2 are contained within of insulin- stimulated glucose from blood indicates that consensus SH2 binding motifs. Binding of signaling molecules, via their SH2 ipheral resistance to insulin's action in muscle and fat domains, to tyrosine phosphorylated IRS-I,2 couples the initiates the preclinical process of NIDDM [2, 5, 48].

These findings, coupled with the demonstration that there PI3-kinase is one of the SH2 domain- containing sig- is a strong hereditary component that accounts for haling molecules activated by binding IRS-I,2 that is NIDDM [49, 50], have led to the conclusion that the likely to be critical for coupling the IR to glucose uptake primary or inherited lesion in NIDDM is impaired sen- and GLUT4 translocation [58-63]. PI-3,4,5-P~ functions as to maintain euglycemia, over time the beta cell becomes an early second messenger linking the IR to GLUT4 insufficient to maintain euglycemia, and clinical NIDDM translocation and glucose transport, although, the mech- (increased blood glucose levels) develops. The importance of IRS-I and PI3-kinase disease is characterized by a variety of additional changes in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and glucose which may either be inherited or arise as a result of the uptake is supported by the findings that IRS-1 knockout diabetic environment [2, 5, 48, 49, 5l]. Ligand binding to the IR leads to receptor autophosphorylation which functions to activate the tyrosine kinase catalytic domain and to create binding sites for the PTB domains oflRS-1,2 and SHC. Binding of IRS-1,2 and SHC to the IR juxtaposes these molecules adjacent to tyrosine kinase, thereby enabling them to become tyrosine-phosphorylated. Tyrosine- phosphorylated IRS-1,2 and SHC then bind and activate SH2-containing signaling molecules. Binding of the SH2 domain of GRB2 to SHC results in the activation of the RAS-MAP kinase pathway, whereas binding of the SH2 domains of P85-associated PI3-kinase to IRS1,2 results in the activation of PI3-kinase. PI3-kinase is responsible for coupling the IR to GLUT4 translocation in insulin-responsive tissues such as skeletal muscle and adipocytes. insulin resistance in the \"common type\" of NIDDM are sine phosphorylation of IRS- 1; (3) a decrease in GLUT4 still not known. The early intracellular TNF AND INSULIN RESISTANCE responses activated by the IR are central to the activation of both pathways.

CoQ10 herein revoked the HFFD/STZ effects on the content/activity of glucose/lipid panels, insulin receptors CoQ10 is known to be deficient in case of diabetes The present model-induced dyslipidemia and precisely the elevated FFAs are responsible partly for the impairment of glucose uptake/utilization with the subsequent increase in hepatic glucose production Additionally, high fructose over nutrition not only induces the hexosamine pathway Revert to the hexosamine pathway glucose is diverted from the glycolytic pathway at the level of fructose-6-phosphate Likewise, hepatic glucose transporter GLUT2 was also increased in the diabetic rats, a finding that coincides with previous studies Consequent to the hyperglycemia/IR, and according to the hyperglycemic extent, the formation of polyols and non enzymatic glycoxidation products of proteins and lipids occur, leading to the formation of heterogeneous products termed advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) CoQ10 is known as a powerful endogenous lipophilic antioxidant Moreover, diabetic animals showed hypo-adiponectinemia that may result from obesity-induced IR in adipose tissue, especially the visceral ones Another adipocytokine assessed in the current study was the pro-inflammatory visfatin, which was elevated significantly in the present model and previous studies Perturbed lipid panel is known to elevate liver aminotransferases, a fact that is exemplified in the present study. Aminotransferases are indicators of hepatic health that is compromised in case of obesity, IR and diabetes To this extent, the improving effect of CoQ10 on the glucose panel and insulin sensitivity can be attributed to its action on the insulin signaling pathway (insulin receptors, tyrosine kinase and PI3K) with the subsequent modulation in the function of the glucose transporters, as well as elevating sRAGE content and adiponectin with its receptors.", "Our previous study showed that a high dose of the bioflavonoid quercetin exacerbated HFD-induced IR; yet, others have demonstrated that quercetin improves insulin sensitivity. The aim of this study was to investigate whether differing doses of quercetin act in a time-dependent manner to attenuate HFD-induced IR in association with improved skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and C57BL/6J mice were fed HFD for 3 or 8 wks, with or without a low (50 ug/day; HF+50Q) or high (600 ug/day, HF+600Q) dose of quercetin. ( Our previous work shows that a high dose of quercetin (24 mg/day) in conjunction with a HFD exacerbates whole body IR after 3wks of feeding, and this alteration is abolished after 8wks of supplementation Several factors contribute to the pathogenesis of HFD-induced IR and, in one case, HFD-induced IR occurs independent of decreases in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function HFD decreases Quercetin-induced skeletal muscle In summary, our study demonstrated that the insulin sensitizing effects of dietary quercetin supplementation occur in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The protective benefits of quercetin in preventing HFD-induced IR occurred only with a low dose of quercetin after a longer supplementation period and were associated with increased skeletal muscle Energy Expenditure Means.", "We investigated changes in circulating levels of these LPM in 17 children (0.25\u20136 y) undergoing medically indicated CT scans involving relatively low IR doses. We found significant decreases ( Future larger studies are warranted to confirm our findings and to test whether high circulating antioxidant levels protect against IR damage Computed tomography (CT) CT use has risen substantially over the past few decades, particularly in children [ Coenzyme Q10 (Q10), carotenoids, tocopherols, and retinol are lipid phase micronutrients (LPM) known to function as important antioxidant agents that help to mitigate the damaging effects of oxidative and other injuries. Q10 occurs in humans primarily through cellular biosynthesis with limited dietary exposure [ Pro vitamin A and other carotenoids, tocopherols, and retinol are LPM that function as important antioxidants via neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species thereby reducing oxidative stress and/or preventing oxidative damage [ In this pilot study, our aim was to determine whether the plasma levels of LPM change in young children after they received medically indicated CT exams involving relatively low IR doses between 0.78 and 11.30 millisieverts (mSv). We hypothesized that the IR exposure from CT scans would lead to changes in plasma LPM levels due to the nature of these compounds to act as radical scavengers [ As expected, subjects with reported vitamin intake had higher levels of some pro-vitamin A carotenoids at baseline than nonvitamin users, however, no differences in levels were observed between these two groups post-CT. This could be due to the higher levels of the supplement users being consumed by the CT procedure thereby protecting the subjects from IR damage. Since humans are composed mainly of water, hydroxyl free radicals or other ROS are the most common products of IR exposure that react readily with other molecules [ Previous data have suggested a protective effect of antioxidants against several forms of IR-induced DNA damage. However, much of this data has been generated from To our knowledge, this is the first study looking at the effects of CT-induced IR on circulating antioxidants in young children In the clinical setting and particularly the ED, the use of CT will continue to be of tremendous benefit for a variety of situations such as diagnosing and managing children with blunt trauma, seizures, altered mental status, headache and abdominal pain, and others. For that reason, future studies are required to test whether supplementation with vitamins can act as a prophylactic modality for CT-induced IR damage particularly in children who are most vulnerable to IR insults. In our pilot study we found marked decreases in the levels of several LPM in young children receiving medically indicated CT scans involving relatively low IR doses. To our knowledge, this is the first study looking at the effects of physiologically relevant IR doses in young children None declared.", "No treatment = 0R; +IR = 4000 R of X-rays. Statistical significance between \u00b1IR pairs was computed using unpaired 2-tailed In order to examine the spindle assembly checkpoint, tissues were incubated with the microtubule depolymerizer colchicine for 2 hours. To examine whether cephalic and gonad neoplasms can undergo IR-induced apoptosis, we irradiated the larvae with 4000R of X-rays, fixed, and stained the tissues for cleaved active caspase-3.", "The purpose of this study was to examine chemokine production in a mouse model of mesenteric IR injury. We hypothesized that intestinal IR injury would induce remote organ injury and enhance serum CC and XC chemokine levels. In IR animals, the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was occluded for 30, 45, or 75 min, while controls underwent sham laparotomy, n = 5-7 per group. MIP-1\u03b1 levels were only significantly increased at 45 min IR. We did not find any significant IR injury-induced changes in levels of MCP-5, MIP-1\u03b3, or GCP-2, at any ischemia time frame. The data suggest a complex response to IR injury whereby chemokines that are active on a variety of leukocytes may play a role in inducing local and remote tissue injury.", "Metabolically, insulin-induced IR tyrosine kinase activation plays a key role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. A dysfunctional process of insulin induced IR activation may result in a range of clinical manifestations including insulin resistance , type 2 diabetes (T2DM), obesity, cancer, hypertension, and cardiovascular disorders . Structurally, IR is a heavily glycosylated receptor with 18 glycosylation sites . Fourteen of the glycosylation sites are localized on the IR\u03b1 subunits, while the other sites are on the IR\u03b2 subunits . Specifically, the IR\u03b1 subunits contain only the N-linked carbohydrate, while IR\u03b2 subunits contain both O- and N-linked carbohydrates . The importance of glycosylation in IR biosynthesis, insulin binding and activation has been studied in detail using site-directed mutagenesis analyses . reported on the potential contribution of N-linked oligosaccharides of the IR\u03b2 subunit in the processing, structure and function of the IR . They specifically targeted and mutated IR\u03b2 subunits (IR\u03b2-N1234) which were mutagenized on four potential N-glycosylation sites (ASn-X-Ser/Thr). They compared the mutated IR-N1234 with the wild type receptor. There were no differences on the molecular weight of IR\u03b1 subunits between both receptors. However, a reduction in the molecular weight from 95kDa to 80kDa of the IR\u03b2 subunit was depicted in the mutated IR form. The data indicated that the mutation of the four glycosylation sites in IR\u03b2 subunit had no effect on the \u03b1-subunit, but caused a reduction in the \u03b2-subunit molecular weight. This IR\u03b2-N1234 mutation had no effect on IR cell surface expression and on insulin binding, but attenuated IR\u03b2 tyrosine kinase activation by insulin . These early findings provided supporting evidence for a critical role of oligosaccharide side chains of the IR\u03b2 subunit in the molecular events responsible for the IR enzymatic activation and signal transduction. Recently, the treatment of rat skeletal L6 myoblast cells with either mouse-derived mammalian Neu1 sialidase or neuraminidase resulted in a desialylation of IR, which coincided with a significant increase of L6 myoblast cell proliferative responses to low concentrations of insulin . In support of this hypothesis, it has been reported that a transient upregulation of Neu3 expression in L6 myocytes caused a significant decrease in IR signaling, the mechanism of which was proposed to be in direct modulation of plasma membrane gangliosides by Neu3 activity and the interaction with the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) . Recently, insulin binding to its receptor was reported to rapidly induce the interaction of the insulin receptor with Neu1 sialidase, the activity of which hydrolyzes sialic acid residues of IR and, consequently, induces receptor activation . provided additional confirmation to support that Neu1 interacts with IR\u03b2 and desialylates the receptor . This present report describes a novel organizational IR signaling platform describing the intermediates linked to the insulin-induced receptor activation process in live IR-expressing cells. Here, insulin binding to its receptor induces a Neu1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) cross-talk in activating IRs. Central to this process is that Neu1 and MMP-9 cross-talk in alliance with neuromedin B GPCR forms a complex tethered at the ectodomain of IR\u03b2 subunits on the cell surface. These findings are consistent with another report that predicts a prerequisite desialylation process by activated Neu1 enabling the removal of steric hindrance to IR\u03b2 subunit association and the activation of tyrosine kinases. This Neu1-MMP-9 crosstalk in alliance with neuromedin B GPCR at the ectodomain of IR\u03b2 subunits forms the essential signaling platform on the cell surface that is critical for insulin-induced receptor activation. Olanzapine-induced Neu3 activity attenuated IR\u03b2 and IRS1 phosphorylation associated with insulin-stimulated human fibroblast cells. HTC-WT cell line is the wild-type rat hepatoma cell line and HTC-IR cells, a rat hepatoma cell line that overly expresses the human insulin receptors (kindly provided by Dr. Leda Raptis, of this department). For HTC-IR cell line, the medium was supplemented with 400\u03bcg/mL of G418 as selection marker for IR expression. The expression of insulin receptors was determined by using antibody specific for IR\u03b2 (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). IR\u03b2 antibody is a rabbit anti-human antibody that is raised against a peptide mapping at the C-terminus of IR\u03b2 of human origin. The anti-phosphorylated insulin receptor \u03b2 (p-IR\u03b2; MBL International, Woburn, MA 01801) antibody is a rabbit anti-human antibody that is raised against a chemically synthesized phospho-peptide derived from the region of the human insulin receptor that contains tyrosine 972. The anti-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (p-IRS-1; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) is a rabbit anti-human antibody specific for phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (p-IRS). Four neutralizing antibodies were used to inhibit sialidase activity in live HTC-IR and primary murine macrophage cell lines. Sialidase activity of live HTC-IR cells was indicated by the blue fluorescence surrounding the periphery of the cells. HTC-IR cells were cultured on 12mm glass coverslips in a sterile 24well plate in conditional medium as previously described. The fixed cells were immunostained with 4\u03bcg/mL rabbit anti-human pIR\u03b2 antibody for 1h at 37\u00b0C, followed with AlexaFluor 488 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody for 1h at 37\u00b0C. HTC-IR cells were cultured in 75cm flasks at 37\u00b0C until confluent. Cell lysates were prepared from the following cell lines: HTC-IR, HTC-WT and MiaPaCa-2. The blot was probed with rabbit anti-insulin receptor \u03b2 (IR\u03b2) antibody or rabbit anti-human phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (pIRS-1) antibody (Cell Signaling) as primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. Each in the graphs represents the mean ratio of IR\u03b2 to \u03b2-actin of band density\u00b1 () for 5\u201310 replicate measurements. HTC-IR cells were left cultured in medium or in medium containing 100nM insulin for the indicated time intervals. For immunoprecipitation, Neu-1, -2 and -4, MMP9 and insulin receptor in cell lysates from HTC-IR cells using 100\u03bcg of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either 1\u03bcg of rabbit-anti-human Neu1 antibody, mouse anti-human Neu2 antibody, rabbit anti-human Neu4 antibody or goat anti-human MMP9 antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. The blot was incubated with rabbit anti-human IR\u03b2 antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C followed with Clean-Blot IP Detection Reagent for immunoprecipitation/western blots (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 60min at room temperature and Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus. HTC-IR cell lysates that were not incubated with the IR\u03b2 antibody prior to the immunoprecipitation step were used as a negative control in the co-IP experiments. HTC-IR cells were cultured on 12mm circular glass coverslips in a sterile 24well plate in conditional medium as described. Cells were incubated with 4\u03bcg/mL of one of the following combinations of antibodies (IR\u03b2 antibody and Neu1 antibody; IR\u03b2 antibody and Neu2 antibody; IR\u03b2 antibody and Neu3 antibody; IR\u03b2 antibody and Neu4 antibody; or IR\u03b2 antibody and MMP9 antibody) for 60min at 37\u00b0C. Insulin binding to its receptor has been reported to rapidly induce the interaction of the IR with Neu1 . Activated Neu1 hydrolyzes sialic acid residues of the receptor and, consequently, induces IR activation. Since IRs belong to the same family of receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR and TrkA, we initially asked whether insulin-induced IR activation follows this similar receptor signaling paradigm. Using a rat hepatoma cell line overly expressing human IR (HTC-IR), we performed a sialidase assay on the live cells as previously described . As shown in A, insulin stimulation of live HTC-IR cells dose-dependently induced sialidase activity. As shown in B, anti-human Neu1 antibody blocked the sialidase activity associated with insulin-treated live HTC-IR cells comparable to the levels of no insulin treated controls. In contrast, antibodies against the other three human sialidases, Neu-2, -3 and -4 had no blocking effect on sialidase activity associated with insulin stimulated live HTC-IR cells similar to the mean fluorescence levels of insulin positive control (B). These latter data provide additional supporting evidence for Neu1 involvement with insulin activation of live IR expressing cells. If insulin-induced receptor phosphorylation is dependent on Neu1 activity, then neuraminidase inhibitor like Tamiflu or anti-Neu1 neutralizing antibody should have an inhibitory effect on insulin-induced phosphorylation of IGF-1R, IRS-1 and IR\u03b2 in IR-expressing cells. Immunocytochemistry analyses shown in A demonstrate that Tamiflu, anti-Neu1 antibody and G\u03b1i protein inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX) significantly inhibited insulin-induced pIGF-1R and pIRS-1 in wild-type human fibroblast cells compared to the insulin treated controls. Western blot analyses confirmed that Tamiflu and anti-Neu1 antibodies markedly inhibited insulin-induced pIRS-1 in HTC-IR cells compared to the insulin treated controls (B). To test the inhibitory effect of Tamiflu on insulin-induced phosphorylation of IR\u03b2, HTC-IR cells were left untreated as controls, and either stimulated with 100nM insulin together with 50nM cyclolignan picropodophyllin (PPP), or inhibited using 350\u03bcg/mL Tamiflu prior to the stimulation with 100nM of insulin. Immunocytochemistry analyses demonstrated that 100nM of insulin was able to induce the phosphorylation of IR\u03b2 in HTC-IR cells. Tamiflu pretreated cells at 350\u03bcg/mL for 35min followed by 100nM insulin stimulation for 5min together with 50nM PPP was able to significantly inhibit insulin-induced pIR\u03b2 activation in HTC-IR cells (C). According to the glycosylation model of IR, fourteen of the 18 glycosylation sites are localized on the IR\u03b1 subunits, while the other sites are on the IR\u03b2 subunits . The IR\u03b1 subunits contain only the N-linked carbohydrate, while IR\u03b2 subunits contain both O- and N-linked carbohydrates . Studies on mutational analyses of the four glycosylation sites in IR\u03b2 subunit found no effects on the expression of IR on the cell surface and did not interfere with insulin binding to the IR\u03b1 subunit, but the IR\u03b2 tyrosine kinase activation by insulin was attenuated . These findings suggest that the glycosylation modification of the side chains of the IR\u03b2 subunits are critical for the IR tyrosine kinase activation and signal transduction associated with insulin binding to IR\u03b1 subunits. To test whether this same organizational signaling platform is involved with IR activation, we initially asked whether Neu1 forms a complex with IR\u03b2 subunits of insulin receptors. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using cell lysates from HTC-IR cells demonstrated that Neu-1 (A) and not Neu-2 (B) or Neu-4 (C) forms a complex with naive and insulin-stimulated cells. The data also show that Neu-2 and -4 were present in the whole cell lysates from naive HTC-IR cells. In support of the co-immunoprecipitation results with HTC-IR cells, the data shown in D validated the predicted association of Neu1 with IR\u03b2. Zeiss M2 Imager fluorescence microscopy revealed the colocalization of Neu1 with IR\u03b2 (32% overlay) in naive HTC-IR cells. There was no colocalization of Neu2 and Neu4 with IR\u03b2 in these cells, which is consistent with the co-immunoprecipitation findings. Taken together, these results indicate that Neu1 forms a complex with IR\u03b2 subunits of IR on the cell surface prior to ligand binding, thereby providing confirmation additional to that of previous reports . If Neu1 forms a complex with IR\u03b2 subunits of insulin receptors, we questioned how insulin binding to its receptor activates Neu1. Based on these findings, we asked whether Neu1 is also connected with MMP-9 and GPCR for ligand-induced IR\u03b2 subunits. These latter results suggest that elevated MMP activity such as gelatinase B (MMP-9) in the microcirculation of these hypertensive rats leads to proteolytic cleavage of cell surface membrane receptors including the cleavage of the IR\u03b1 subunit binding domain . Accordingly, we propose a Neu1-MMP-9 cross-talk in alliance with GPCR that is required for insulin activation of IR\u03b2. To test this hypothesis, the inhibitory effect of the broad range MMP inhibitors, galardin (GM6001) and piperazine as well as the MMP3 specific inhibitor (MMP3i) on sialidase activity associated with insulin-stimulated live HTC-IR cells was examined. The data shown in show that piperazine (PIPZ, A), galardin (B) and MMP9 inhibitor (MMP9i, A) except for MMP3i (C) dose-dependently inhibited the sialidase activity associated insulin-treated live HTC-IR cells compared to the no ligand control levels. Western blot analyses using cell lysates from HTC-IR cells clearly showed that MMP9i at 50 and 100\u03bcg/mL inhibited insulin-induced pIRS1 in these cell lysates (B). Together, the additional intracellular and cell-surface colocalization of IR\u03b2 and MMP-9 validated the predicted cross-talk between Neu1 and MMP-9 crosstalk tethered to IR\u03b2 subunits (C). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using cell lysates from HTC-IR cells demonstrated that MMP-9 forms a complex with naive and insulin-stimulated IR\u03b2 (D). Co-immunoprecipitation experiment using cell lysates from HTC-WT cells demonstrated that neuromedin B GPCR forms a complex with naive and insulin-stimulated IR\u03b2s (B). Collectively, the additional intracellular and cell-surface colocalization of Neu1 and MMP-9 validated the predicted cross-talk between the neuromedin B GPCR\u2013MMP-9\u2013Neu1 tripartite complex tethered to IR\u03b2 subunits of insulin receptors. It has been reported that insulin-induced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in L6 myotubes was increased several fold, and olanzapine inhibited insulin-stimulated IRS-1-associated PI3K activity in a dose-dependent manner . In addition, immunocytochemistry analyses of wild-type fibroblast pretreated with olanzapine or anti-Neu1 antibodies attenuated phosphorylation of IGF-R and IRS1 associated with insulin-stimulated human fibroblast cells. Based on these results, we propose that olanzapine-induced Neu3 sialidase activity down-regulates Neu1, the inhibition of which attenuated insulin-induced IGF-R and IRS1 phosphorylation contributing to insulin resistance. The molecular mechanism(s) by which IRs become activated is not well understood. The findings in this report uncover a molecular organizational GPCR signaling platform of a novel Neu1 and MMP-9 cross-talk in alliance with IR\u03b2 subunits on the cell surface of IR-expressing cells that is essential for insulin activation of IRs and subsequent cellular signaling. The data further indicate that Neu1 forms a complex with the IR\u03b2 subunits of the receptor on the cell surface prior to ligand binding, thereby providing confirmation additional to that of previous reports . In addition, mutational analyses targeting IR\u03b2 subunits which were mutagenized on four N-glycosylation sites (IR\u03b2-N1234) attenuated IR\u03b2 tyrosine kinase activation by insulin . Collectively, our data provide additional evidence to demonstrate that a tripartite complex of neuromedin B GPCR\u2013MMP-9\u2013Neu1 is tethered to IR\u03b2 subunits of insulin receptors. Based on mutagenesis studies on the four N-glycosylation sites (IR\u03b2-N1234) of the IR\u03b2 subunit of the receptor , the intra-sterically inhibitory ligand-free basal state kinase is most likely under the control of \u03b1-2,3 sialic acid residues of IR\u03b2, and the kinase activation state induced by insulin is regulated by Neu1 sialidase activity in hydrolyzing these sialic residues and removing steric hindrance of the activation loop as shown by our data. Disulfide bridges connect the \u03b1\u03b2 subunits within the dimer as well as the IR\u03b1 subunits of \u03b1\u03b2 dimers within the tetramer . The IR\u03b1 subunit is extracellular and provides the insulin binding site. The IR\u03b2 subunit contains a short extracellular region, a transmembrane segment and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. This report proposes a novel molecular organizational GPCR signaling platform for the IR\u03b2 subunits. It is based on the findings that Neu1 and MMP-9 are already in complex with the ligand-free basal state IR\u03b2, and are rapidly induced upon insulin binding to the extracellular IR\u03b1 subunit. This process enables removal of steric hindrance for proper orientation of the tyrosine kinases leading to trans-autophosphorylation and activation of the receptor and subsequent IR signaling cascades. The findings in this report also provide evidence for MMP-9 involvement in the insulin activation of IR\u03b2. It can be speculated that insulin binding to IR\u03b1 subunits on the cell surface initiates GPCR-signaling to activate MMP-9. Our data using co-immunoprecipitation of IR\u03b2 and neuromedin B GPCR suggest that the neuromedin B GPCR forms a complex with naive and insulin-induced IR activation in HTC-WT cells (see B). Since both MMP-9 and NMBR form a complex with IR\u03b2 subunits, they are also associated with each other. It is noteworthy that insulin can mediate increases in MMP-9 via IR activation , which fits well within our molecular signaling platform of Neu1-MMP-9 cross-talk in regulating insulin-induced receptors. The connection between GPCR and IR has also been demonstrated for \u03b2-adrenergic receptors tethering to IR in adipocytes . These reports showed that insulin binding IR stimulates the phosphorylation of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor on Tyr-350 and this process facilitates IR tethering to \u03b2-adrenergic receptor via growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb-2). This molecular signaling platform integrating the IR/\u03b2-adrenergic receptor/Grb-2 tripartite complex is critical for \u03b2-adrenergic agonist amplification of insulin-dependent activation of p42/p44 MAPK. The premise behind this molecular signaling platform is to improve IR signaling in our present study and others , but also in other RTKs like PDGF\u03b2R with a GPCR. If Neu1 sialidase is playing a major role in the activation of IR as our data suggest and by others , logistically Neu1 may be the potential target for insulin resistance. Wild-type human fibroblast cells pretreated with olanzapine attenuated phosphorylation of IGF-R and IRS1 associated with insulin-stimulated cells. Collectively, olanzapine-induced Neu3 sialidase activity is proposed to down-regulate Neu1, the inhibition of which attenuates insulin-induced IGF-R and IRS1 phosphorylation and contributing to insulin resistance. That report also showed that the transient transfection of Neu3 into 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myocytes caused a significant decrease in IR signaling. The report proposed that this insulin resistance is due to the interaction of IR with Neu1 subunit of the elastin receptor complex triggered by elastin-binding peptides. In the present study, olanzapine-induced Neu3 sialidase activity down-regulates Neu1 by inhibiting MMP9 activation and thereby, disrupting the Neu1\u2013MMP9-neuromedin B GPCR signaling platform tethered to IR\u03b2 subunits in the activation of insulin receptors. We propose here that a negative unbalance of this novel IR\u03b2 subunit signaling platform critical for the insulin receptor contributes to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.", "Use of both knockdown and knockout cell lines indicates that unlike the case for IR-induced DSBs, the requirement for K63-ubiquitylation for the repair of replication associated DSBs was found to be RNF8-independent. In the case of IR-induced direct two-ended DSBs, the ubiquitin (Ub) ligases RNF8 and RNF168 are required for the recruitment of essential downstream repair proteins including BRCA1, 53BP1, and RAD18 In this study we investigated the importance of K63-ubiquitylation in DSB-repair during S-phase. Recently, it has become clear that, besides IR-induced two-ended DSBs produced in G2-phase, secondary replication-associated DSBs in S-phase are a major substrate for HR-dependent repair following IR Construction of WTUb-GFP and K63RUb-GFP expression plasmids has been described previously WT-Ub-GFP and K63R-Ub-GFP inserts were PCR amplified from the original vectors and cloned as Age1/EcoR1 fragments into lentiviral vector pJLM1.

(E-F) Mutations at the K63-ubiquitylation has previously been implicated in the DNA damage tolerance pathway, which is important for response to ultraviolet (UV)-induced thymine dimers and other replication blocking lesions We also assessed genomic instability by quantification of endogenous and CPT-induced chromosome aberrations ( To further investigate the repair defect in cells with suppressed K63-ubiquitylation, we exposed cells to various doses of CPT, PARPi, or IR and measured clonogenic survival. (C) IR, data are mean \u00b1 sd. The E2 enzyme UBC13 is known to catalyse specific formation of K63-linked Ub chains in response to various types of DNA damage To resolve the apparent discrepancy between IR-induced mutation frequency and survival observed in K63RUb cells, we assessed DNA repair kinetics at sites of damage by monitoring the formation and resolution of DNA repair foci following treatment with IR. K63-ubiquitylation has previously been shown to play an important role in the recruitment and/or retention of BRCA1 and 53BP1 to direct DSBs (A) WT and K63R Ub cells were fixed and immuno-stained for \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 foci at the indicated time points following 2 Gy IR or untreated (Ctrl). of 2 independent exp's, >150 cells were analysed per time-point (B) 30 min EdU (10 \u00b5M) incorporation before 2 Gy IR, cells were fixed 30 min or 24 hrs post IR, EdU and 53BP1 foci were visualized by fluorescent staining and quantified.

Clonogenic survival was assessed after (B) 4 Gy IR and (C) PARPi (continuous) (B-C) Data are mean \u00b1 s.d. (D) Spontaneous and IR-induced (4 Gy) mutations were determined at the (A) Depletion of HLTF or SHPRH in combination with knock-down of RNF8 was achieved using lentiviral shRNA's and was confirmed using real-time PCR. (B) Spontaneous or CPT (20 nM) induced mutations were determined at the To further confirm the RNF8-independent function of K63-ubiquitylation we performed the experiments in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from the RNF8-/- mouse (A-C) Clonogenic survival of RNF8-/- MEFs uninfected or infected with K63RUb or empty vector (EV) after (A) IR, (B) CPT (24 h) or (C) PARPi (continuous). K63-ubiquitylation has previously been implicated in the response to UV-induced damage, and in the response to direct DSBs produced by IR. In agreement with the lack of sensitization observed following treatment with IR, suppression of K63-ubiquitylation did not cause a general defect in establishment or resolution of 53BP1 foci at the majority of IR-induced DSBs. However, we did detect a delay in the resolution of some of these foci, as indicated by an increase in residual foci remaining at 6 and 24 hours after IR ( The nature of the repair defect in S-phase responsible for the observed genetic instability of K63RUb expressing cells is not yet understood.", "The influence of high doses of IR (>5Gy) on proliferation, cell cycle and induction of senescence has been demonstrated in stem cells. There have been limited studies of the effects of moderate (0.5-5Gy) and low doses (<0.5Gy) of IR on stem cells however, the effect of low dose IR (LD-IR) on normal stem cells as possible targets for radiation-induced carcinogenesis has not been studied in any depth. This review will provide an overview of the current knowledge of radiation-induced effects on normal stem cells, with particular focus on low and moderate doses of IR.", "Here we use the feather follicle as a model to investigate the mechanism of IR-induced tissue damage, because any perturbation of feather growth will be clearly recorded in its regular yet complex morphology. We find that IR induces defects in feather formation in a dose-dependent manner. IR also induces patterning defects in feather formation, with disrupted branching morphogenesis. Furthermore, AG-490, a chemical inhibitor of Stat1 signaling, can partially rescue IR-induced tissue damage. Our results suggest that the feather follicle could serve as a useful model to address the in vivo impact of the many mechanisms of IR-induced tissue damage. IR is an important tool in cancer therapy, either as the primary choice or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents Given the wide range of cell activities that might be disrupted by radiation exposure, it is important to evaluate their relative contributions in vivo. Careful choice of dose-regimen is critical in cancer therapy Chicken embryo has a long history of serving as a model to dissect the mechanism of IR-induced tissue damage. IR has a profound impact on limb bud development, leading to truncation of the structure The avian feather, like mammal hair, is an ectoderm organ with robust growth and regeneration capability but with much more complex structures Here we use the feather follicle as a model to dissect the impact of the many possible mechanisms of IR-induced tissue damage. Therefore, an IR-induced cytokine response is a major cause of tissue damage in feather formation. (B) This area was placed under a lead window and exposed to IR. (D) Phenotypes of feathers after IR exposure. We found IR perturbed feather formation in a dose-dependent manner. At 5 Gy, feather branches remained normal ( (A\u2013B) H&E analysis of feather follicles after IR-exposure at different doses. This is transient and reversible; at T2 (2 days post-IR) the feathers become normal again. Heterogeneity in T3 (3 days post-IR) is noticed, with some recovered little while others showed branching epithelium again. (C) Whole-mount prep of feather epithelial branching at T1 (1 day post-IR) showing the disrupted patterning at 10 or 20 Gy. At a higher dose (20 Gy), the impact was more severe ( We examined the perturbed feather development by whole-mount prep analysis We next analyzed the molecular events after IR exposure in the feather follicle ( (A) Immunohistochemistry (red) showing P53 activation, gama-H2AX expression, and PARP activation after IR exposure. T0, control samples before IR; T1, 1 day post-IR; T2, 2 days post-IR. IR induces a wide range of possible cell responses, including DNA damage/repair, cell cycle arrest, and cell death/apoptosis. PARP is involved in DNA damage repair or as a substrate for Caspase-3 in apoptosis An important consequence of IR exposure is activation of cytokine production. This is often associated with long-term effect of IR exposure such as inflammation and fibrosis (A) RT-PCR analysis showing increased expression of IL-1beta, IFN-gama, TNF-alpha, but not TGF-beta1 or TGF-beta2 in the feather follicles. (B) In situ hybridization showing cytokine genes are induced mostly in the epithelium at T1 samples (1 day post-IR). To evaluate the contribution of downstream signaling pathways, and more importantly, to enable rationally design methods to reduce or rescue the IR damage, we investigated the downstream events. We found IR exposure significantly increased Stat1 expression ( (A) RT-PCR and densitometrical quantification showing increased Stat1 expression in the feather follicles. (B) Stat1 antibody staining showing nuclear enrichment after IR exposure (T1 samples). Compared to a control virus carrying only GFP, Stat1 over-expression produced extensive branching abnormality ( Supporting evidence for a role of Stat1 gene in IR pathology comes from rescue experiments. We tested whether this molecule could reduce or rescue IR-induced defects in feather formation. And 5.5% cases showed only grade I defect ( (A) Statistics of feather morphology after 20 Gy IR exposure and AG-490 rescue. Compared to un-rescued samples, the feather branching was more regular although some defects still remained ( IR is routinely used in treating cancer patients. all contribute to IR-induced tissue damage. Previous reports suggested IR could induce extensive DNA damage and double-strand break, but mostly will be repaired within an hour A clear dose-response to IR is revealed by this investigation. The patterning defect induced by IR in feather formation is intriguing. Such an effect has long been suspected but the exact mechanism remains elusive, as IR induced many defects in embryonic development. However, recent work suggested that IR-ablation of progenitor cells but not a patterning mechanism is responsible The feather system is a traditional model for developmental studies. This property makes it a wonderful system for pathological studies such as applied here in the IR settings. For instance, IR induces oxidative and nitrative stresses. iNOS Through this investigation, we find AG-490, a small molecule inhibitor of Jak/Stat1 signaling, can rescue IR-induced tissue damage. The chickens were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) before IR exposure in Department of Radiation Oncology, Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University. A homogeneous distribution of IR was achieved in this exposure window. injected twice at 5 mg/kg right before IR exposure and 24 hours later. Feather follicles were collected before (control) or after IR exposure at designated times and processed for further analysis.", "Here, we discuss current insights into the mechanism of NHEJ and the interplay between NHEJ and other pathways for repair of IR-induced DNA damage. V(D)J recombination occurs at discrete sites (recombination signal sequences) in immunoglobulin, T cell receptor and B cell receptor genes, and produces closed DNA hairpin ends (at the coding ends) that upon hairpin opening, processing and rejoining go on to form the coding sequence, and 5\u2032-phosphorylated blunt signal ends that are sealed and lost from the system [ For simplicity, we can think of NHEJ of IR-induced DSBs as proceeding in three distinct stages. Lastly, is rejoining of the DSB ends by the XRCC4-DNA ligase IV complex [ IR-induced DSBs are detected by the abundant, nuclear protein Ku70/80, composed of approximately 70 and 80 kDa subunits, that binds double stranded (ds) DNA ends with high affinity in a largely sequence independent manner [ As discussed above, IR induced DSBs are considered complex, frequently containing base damage close to the DSB as well as short DNA overhangs and non-ligatable DNA termini [ Recently, two other proteins have been identified that bear a PNKP-like FHA domain: APLF, and aprataxin (APTX). Loss of either Ku or DNA-PKcs results in enhanced DNA end resection in G2 phase cells, which consequently promotes repair by HR [ In vitro studies from the Paull laboratory demonstrate that the presence of DNA-PKcs blocks Exonuclease 1 (Exo1) activity and that DNA-PKcs' autophosphorylation or phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs by ATM, is required to relieve inhibition of Exo1 by DNA-PKcs [ Another significant recent development has been the generation by the Tainer laboratory of small molecule inhibitors specific for Mre11 endo- or exonuclease activities [ Another important regulator of pathway choice is 53BP1, which, with its interacting partner Rif1, acts to promote NHEJ in G1 by protecting DSB ends from DNA end-resection [ Since IR induces damage to DNA bases as well as DNA single strand breaks, much also remains to be learned about how NHEJ interfaces with base excision repair and DNA single strand break repair pathways as well as alternative NHEJ pathways [ It has been over twenty years since DNA-PKcs was identified [ Work in the author's laboratory is supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP13639) and the National Institutes of Health Program Project Grant (P01-CA92584).", "The binding of insulin to the \u03b1-subunits of IR leads to the activation of the \u03b2 subunit via auto-phosphorylation. When activated, IR phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, which then activate phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K). Muscle biopsies of insulin resistant subjects revealed a reduction in the enzymatic activity and phosphorylation state of kinases and substrates involved in the IR signaling pathway (for review, see Schulingkamp et al., In the past, the brain was described as \u201can insulin insensitive organ\u201d (Goodner and Berrie, The initial evidence of Interestingly, it was shown that high peripheral insulin concentrations acutely increase the levels of insulin in the brain and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), whereas prolonged peripheral hyperinsulinemia leads to a down-regulation of IRs in the BBB and to a reduction in insulin transport into the brain (Wallum et al., IRs are selectively distributed in the brain. Thus, IRs mRNA levels are highly concentrated in several brain areas including the olfactory bulb, pyriform cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus and the cerebellar cortex (Marks et al., The expression of IRs in specific brain regions, particularly the hippocampus and medial temporal cortex suggests that insulin is implicated in memory processes (Singh et al., By contrast, several findings have showed that insulin dysfunction, e.g., chronic hyperinsulinemia, DM or insulin resistance have a negative impact on memory process and cognitive function (Roriz-Filho et al., Mechanisms by which insulin might influence memory are reviewed elsewhere (Zhao and Alkon, In this context, it was demonstrated that treatment with insulin sensitizers (e.g., liragultide, pioglitazone) ameliorates central insulin resistance (Han et al., Interestingly, it was recently established that administration of intranasal insulin is a non-invasive technique that leads to an increase of insulin levels specifically in the CNS, without affecting peripheral glucose and insulin levels (Reger et al., Therefore, although emerging evidence support a role of brain insulin signaling in several complex CNS functions, additional mechanistic studies are warranted to better elucidate the contribution of insulin signaling in normal and diseased brains. Another model of insulin signaling impairment that might represent a model of T2DM is the IRS-2 Therefore, animal models of insulin signaling dysfunction have provided additional evidence that insulin plays crucial role in the regulation of Tau phosphorylation Data from T1DM and T2DM animal models strongly suggest that insulin signaling plays a key role in modulating AD pathogenesis. The phosphorylation levels of IRs were reported to be significantly decreased in mice treated with systemic STZ (Jolivalt et al., Conflicting results have also been reported for Akt, a key kinase implicated in the insulin-signaling pathway, and also known to phosphorylate Tau Moreover, Moroz et al. have demonstrated that HFD-induced T2DM leads to an increase in mRNA levels of IRS-1 and IRS-4 in the brain of non-transgenic mice (Moroz et al., Interestingly, a recent study has demonstrated that HFD potentiated Tau pathology in a mouse model of Tauopathy, in a manner independent from insulin resistance, suggesting that other factors, probably linked to obesity, might be implicated in Tau pathology during T2DM (Leboucher et al., Several investigators have also reported a deregulation in gene and/or protein expression of the insulin-signaling pathway in T3DM animal models. (Deng et al., In summary, the involvement of the central insulin signaling in Tau pathology is still controversial, with divergent results showing a decrease, an increase, or even no significant changes in the insulin signaling proteins in the brains of diabetic animals (Table Beside its classical function of regulating glucose metabolism, there is increasing evidence supporting a role for the insulin-signaling pathway in neuronal development as well as in learning and memory, therefore suggesting a crucial role of insulin signaling in AD pathogenesis (Zhao and Alkon, It has been proposed that insulin could affect Tau phosphorylation through the regulation of GSK-3\u03b2, since it is a kinase downstream in the IR signaling pathway (Hong and Lee, Furthermore, several studies have investigated the impact of rosiglitazone treatment on Tau phosphorylation in animal models.", "When insulin binds to IR, it induces conformational changes that lead to the transphosphorylation of the beta subunits of IR and a cascade of phosphorylation of other IR-recruited proteins. Proteins recruited by the activated IR include insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins that mediate most of the insulin intracellular signaling and other scaffold proteins. These proteins contain an NH2-terminal pleckstrin homology domain and a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain that allows the coupling of IRS proteins to IR and other activated receptors such as growth hormone (GH) receptor, some IL receptors, and integrins. In addition, IRSs contain other tyrosine and serine phosphorylation sites capable to bind to numerous effectors or adapter proteins (). Phosphorylated IRS proteins activate three main intracellular signaling pathways. The third pathway involves the proto-oncogene Cbl, and the Cbl-associated protein, which are released from the IR complex after their activation and are accumulated in discrete plasma membrane regions due to interaction with a caveolar protein, flotilin. The activation of oxidative stress-sensitive kinases could lead to serine/threonine phosphorylation of proteins like IR and IRS ().", "This study investigated the role of sFGL2 in renal IR injury in a porcine kidney auto-transplantation model. The increased sFGL2 together with Fc\u03b3RIIB during renal recovery after IR injury suggested that sFGL2 might be a potential renoprotective mediator involved in the renal self-repairing and remodeling in this 2-week porcine auto-transplantation model. It is recently demonstrated that Treg modulate renal IR injury through IL-10-mediated blockade of innate immune cell activation and accumulation [ In conclusion, our findings provide a new insight into renal IR injury throughout 2-week duration in a porcine kidney auto-transplantation model.", "DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in MSCs was upregulated in hypoxia, accelerating the resolution of highly genotoxic IR-induced DNA DSBs.", "However, a mechanism underlying the IR injury-induced lymphatic vessel damage remains unclear. We investigated the alterations of structure and function of lymphatic ducts in a mouse cutaneous IR model. Immunohistochemistry showed that lymphatic ducts were totally vanished by IR injury, while blood vessels were relatively preserved. The mechanism of pressure ulcer is traditionally considered as compression induced ischemia, while other etiologies such as tissue deformity IR injury consists of the ischemia by vascular occlusion and the subsequent disorder by reperfusion. Oxidative stress mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is also involved in IR injuries of internal organs as observed in cerebral infarction and myocardial infarction The mechanism of the damage to blood vessels has been reported in IR injury. The pathogenesis of IR injury begins with a hypoxic insult to the vascular endothelial cells, which promotes leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion and neutrophil migration through the endothelial barrier We hypothesized that a breakdown of the function of lymphatic ducts also might play important role in causing stagnant drainage of tissue fluid, leading to a severe damage. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the damage of lymphatic ducts in cutaneous IR injury by using an already established mouse model In normal Balb/c mouse skin, LYVE-1 The luminal areas and numbers of blood vessels ( In the 16-hr IR injured tissue at 8 hrs after reperfusion, neutrophils infiltrated in the dermis and subcutaneous fat ( LEC and VEC were cultured with H ICG was injected into the dermis between two magnet-pressed areas, and images of the lower body of mice were taken by We also observed the skin manifestation in mice receiving IR of different ischemia times (4, 8, 12, and 16 hrs). Purpura and ulcer ( We plotted the ischemia time and ICG fluorescence intensity at the time points of 1, 2 and 4 days after reperfusion and found that longer ischemic time resulted in larger retention of ICG ( Pressure ulcers are associated with vascular occlusion, deformity of tissues In severe stages of chronic venous insufficiency, a causative of chronic ulcer, the lymphatic capillary network is destroyed, and remaining lymphatic capillary fragments have an increased permeability to dextran with a molecular weight of 150,000 To assess the dysfunction of lymphatic ducts, we injected ICG into the area of IR injury. Regeneration of the damaged tissues starts on day 8 after IR from the marginal area of ulcer, where granulation tissue developed to replace the injured tissue. Echocardiogram is effective for evaluating the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue In conclusion, we showed that lymphatic duct is vulnerable to IR injury partly because of the high sensitivity to harmful ROS. The IR cycle model was previously reported A cycle of IR was performed in each mouse. In the experiment of pathological estimation of lymphatic duct in IR injury, magnet was placed for 16 hrs. Mice were not immobilized, anesthetized, or otherwise treated during IR cycles. In the experiment of functional estimation of lymphatic ducts in IR injury, either of 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16-hr period of magnet placement was followed by observation by The etiology of pressure ulcer is multifactorial.

Induction of these target genes may enhance IR-induced death, but the activity appears not to be directly linked to IR-induced death. Recently, the HDAC inhibitor MS-275 prolonged IR-induced phosphorylation of histone H2AX on serine 139 (\u03b3-H2AX), suggesting a contribution to a decrease in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) (). Unexpectedly, a previous report, however, showed that the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A slightly increased IR-induced phosphorylation of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein but did not increase IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX in primary fibroblasts (). We thus investigated whether two, more specific, HDAC inhibitors, m-carboxycinnamic acid bishydroxyamide (CBHA) () and FK228 (), can affect IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX in human adenocarcinoma A549 cells. We found that these HDAC inhibitors, but not the widely used anticancer agent 5-FU, actually enhanced \u03b3-H2AX immediately after IR exposure in A549 and other cancer cells. In addition, p300 overexpression, instead of the HDAC inhibitors, similarly enhanced IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX, suggesting that CBHA and FK228 selectively enhance IR-induced DNA damage most likely through histone hyperacetylation, and this effect may at least partially confer their radiosensitizing effect. Cells were exposed to IR using 150-kV X-ray equipment (M-150WE, SOFTEX, Tokyo, Japan) that can provide a dose rate of 110 cGy/min. A549 cells were cultured on beef serum albumin-coated glass slides, treated with CBHA or FK228 for 6 h, and then exposed to IR (4 Gy). Although 4 \u03bcM CBHA only slightly induced apoptotic death (approximately 2%), it strongly sensitized A549 cells to IR (, >13% of CBHA-pretreated cells died, but only 2% of cells treated to 30 Gy IR alone died; data not shown). Clonogenic assay revealed that 2 \u03bcM CBHA pretreatment alone only slightly reduced plate efficiency (92%), and its combination with IR strongly and significantly inhibited colony formation, especially at 4 Gy IR (B), suggesting that CBHA pretreatment can radiosensitize A549 cells. We next explored whether CBHA affects IR-induced DNA damage. H2AX phosphorylation (\u03b3-H2AX), which occurs at flanking DSBs, can provide a measure of the number and location of DSBs within the nuclei, and thereby can be used as an indicator of IR-induced DNA damage (). Although ATM was clearly phosphorylated at serine 1981 on IR exposure, 4 \u03bcM CBHA pretreatment alone did not affect the phosphorylation (B). Their combination slightly increased ATM phosphorylation, probably caused by an increase of IR-induced DNA damage, thereby excluding the possibility that the enhanced \u03b3-H2AX was caused by CBHA-mediated direct ATM activation. IR exposure shifted the peak of \u03b3-H2AX (MFI 29), and CBHA pretreatment shifted the peak further (MFI 34; C), suggesting that it increased IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX expression in most populations. We next investigated the effect of CBHA on IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX foci. Several reports have suggested that HDAC inhibitors inhibit recovery from IR-induced DNA damage, because they prolonged \u03b3-H2AX compared with IR alone (). We also found that CBHA clearly enhanced IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX at 24 h. However, the elevated \u03b3-H2AX was mostly reversed at 12 h in all groups and thereafter gradually increased again only in CBHA-pretreated cells (E). We next investigated the effect of CBHA or IR, or both, on the progression of generated A549 xenografts tumors. Although treatment with CBHA or IR alone inhibited tumor growth compared with the control tumors ( = 0.01 and = 0.03 vs. control, respectively), combined therapy suppressed the tumor growth further ( < 0.0001 vs. control). On Day 20, the mean tumor size of the combined treatment group was significantly reduced compared with the other groups ( < 0.0001 vs. control; = 0.04 vs. CBHA alone; and = 0.02 vs. IR alone). The mean tumor weight was also significantly reduced compared with the other groups ( < 0.0001 vs. control, CBHA alone, or IR alone; B). Thus, we confirmed that CBHA also increases the antitumor effect of IR To determine whether our treatment actually increases acetylation of histones, we analyzed histone H4 acetylation in A549 xenografts 2 h after CBHA intratumor injection. CBHA injection clearly increased histone H4 acetylation, and the pretreatment clearly augmented IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX (C), indicating that the augmented \u03b3-H2AX was similarly observed in treatment. If this effect is crucial for CBHA-mediated enhancing effects on \u03b3-H2AX, other HDAC inhibitors might similarly increase IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX. FK228 strongly enhanced IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX, its foci, and MFI (C\u2013E). In contrast, a common anticancer agent 5-FU did not increase IR-induced cell death, although its concentration induced more cell death than FK228, and barely enhanced IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX, its foci, and MFI. Thus, the two different HDAC inhibitors CBHA and FK228 selectively augmented IR-induced death and \u03b3-H2AX. CBHA and FK228 specifically inhibit the classic HDAC family members (class I and class II HDACs) but do not inhibit the silent information regulator 2 (SIR2) family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+-dependent HDACs (class III HDACs) (). We thus investigated its effects on IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX and radiosensitivity. Splitomicin only slightly increased histone H4 acetylation (A), but did not enhance IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX (B). To explore whether histone hyperacetylation is crucial for enhancing the effect on IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX, we transfected the histone acetyltransferase p300-expressing vector into A549 cells. Overexpression of p300 clearly augmented acetylation of histone H3, and both IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX (A) and its foci (B). Thus, distinct hyperacetylation appears to be sufficient to enhance IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX. M-carboxycinnamic acid bishydroxyamide and FK228 pretreatment also augmented IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX in human stomach cancer MKN45 (A) and glioblastoma T98G cells (B). These data strongly suggest that HDAC inhibitors can augment IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX in a broad array of cancer cell types. In this study, we demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors CBHA and FK228 enhanced IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX, which was evaluated using three different methods (, Western blotting, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry). CBHA alone (at subtoxic concentrations) did not affect ATM activity, but it increased the activity after IR, suggesting that the CBHA-mediated increase of \u03b3-H2AX in irradiated cells was not caused by their direct effect on ATM activity. A substantial increase of \u03b3-H2AX foci was detected within 30 min after IR exposure, and the increase was enhanced by CBHA pretreatment. Because \u03b3-H2AX foci appeared immediately after IR exposure, they are likely to arise from IR-induced DSBs. Incubation with FK228 after IR exposure exhibited no enhancing effect on IR. Moreover, p300 overexpression similarly augmented IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX. These data suggest that the HDAC inhibitors may enhance IR-induced DSBs likely through histone hyperacetylation. Although these inhibitors strongly enhanced IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX and radiosensitized all cancer cells we examined, a specific class III HDAC inhibitor, splitomicin, exhibited no distinct effects on either. First, HDAC inhibitors can increase IR-induced DSBs. As described above, they can loosen compact DNA by histone hyperacetylation and allow DNA to become more susceptible to IR (). We showed that CBHA and FK228 enhanced IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX in many cancer cells. Because the CBHA-mediated enhancing effect on \u03b3-H2AX (A) corresponds well with its enhancing effect on radiosensitivity (B), and because DNA damage is an initial step in IR-induced cell death, \u03b3-H2AX enhancement is likely to be associated with their radiosensitizing effect. Recently, two studies have reported that HDAC inhibitors prolonged IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX and reduced expression of DNA repair-related genes, suggesting they have inhibitory roles in the DNA repair machinery (). We also observed that CBHA or FK228 pretreatment extensively increased IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX at 24 h after IR. Considering that \u03b3-H2AX was not only observed in IR-mediated DSBs but was also detected in cells with apoptotic DNA damage (), it is difficult to discriminate the increase from apoptotic DNA damage. Moreover, IR activates p53-mediated transcriptional activity through phosphorylation at S15, S20, and S46, and its functions are regulated by acetylation at its carboxyl terminus (). We have found and enhancing effects of CBHA on IR-induced anticancer activity in A549 lung cancer cells and demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors CBHA and FK228 enhance IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX in various cancer cell types.", "EGFR-CD533\u2013mediated inhibition of other ErbB RTK members such as ErbB2 and ErbB3, both of which have been shown to contribute to IR-stimulated cytoprotective signaling, could also contribute to radiosensitization. After growth factor or IR exposure, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline and snap frozen on dry ice. Split-dose survival experiments were prepared in the same manner and exposed to a total IR dose of 4 Gy. IR has been shown to stimulate ErbB receptor-dependent signal transduction through the MAPK and PI3K cascades. IR stimulates MAPK activity in control cells, as measured by Thr202/Tyr204 phosphorylation (a). IR also activates p70S6K through phosphorylation of T389, a site shown to be stimulated in a PI3K-sensitive manner (). In comparison, both deletion mutants block IR-induced activation of p70S6K in the MDA-MB231 cell line (b). This family of receptors is also stimulated by IR, a mechanism that underlies the phenomenon of accelerated repopulation (). Our experimental results confirm that EGFR-CD533 produces a broad inhibition of the ErbB receptor network and demonstrate a strong relationship between ErbB RTK network activity and clonogenic cell survival after clinically relevant doses of IR. Their examination of jejunal crypt cells after high-dose IR exposure demonstrated enhanced IR-induced apoptosis but no reduction in split-dose survival.", "The Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) gene product appears to play a central role in response to IR-induced genomic damage, loss of ATM function causes hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation, defective cell cycle control and genomic instability (). However, it is known a little whether there is good correlation between IR-induced genetic damage and ATM protein expression levels in human investigation. For above reasons, in the present study, the baseline and IR-induced genetic damage in lung cancer patients and controls was measured with comet assay and MN assay. The purposes of this investigation were to study the genetic instability in lung cancer patients by comparing the difference of the spontaneous and IR-induced genetic damage between lung cancer patients and controls, and to determine the difference of ATM protein expression levels between lung cancer patients and controls. After washing and incubation with IRDye\u2122 800 conjugated affinity purified secondary antibodies (Rockland), protein was detected via Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR, USA). The average IR-induced MTMs in 22 controls and 22 lung cancer patients were 0.71 and 1.23, respectively. The difference of average IR-induced MTMs between controls and lung cancer patients was significant ( >0.05). The mean IR-induced MNR in 22 controls and 22 patients were 66.05\u00b12.09\u2030 and 77.64\u00b12.89\u2030, respectively, and there were significant differences between patient group and control group ( <0.01). presented the results of correlation analysis between ATM protein levels and IR-induced damage in lung cancer patients. In the present study, comet assay and MN assay were simultaneously used to detect IR-induced genetic damage in lung cancer patients, and the results suggested that either the average IR-induced MTM or the average IR-induced MNR in lung cancer patients was significantly higher than those in controls. Our results were in agreement with several previous studies, for example, found that the radiation induced micronuclei in patients with cancers of the breast, head and neck was significantly higher than that of normal individuals, reported that the lung cancer patients and cervical cancer patients from radiosensitive subgroups presented significantly higher IR-induced micronuclei than the healthy donors. The molecular mechanisms involved in IR-induced genetic damage remain elusive, both about how the process is initiated and how it is maintained (). For example, in lung cancer group, IR-induced MTMs of No. 6, 12, 16 and 17 were 2.19, 3.19, 2.00 and 2.55, respectively; IR-induced MTMs of No. IR-induced MNRs of No. 9, 11, 12 and 16 were 103, 101, 108 and 93\u2030, respectively; IR-induced MNRs of No. Deficiency in the function of ATM gene may increase the sensitivity of cells to IR (). In the present study, the ATM protein expression levels of lung cancer patients and controls were detected by Western blotting, and the correlation between the ATM protein expression levels and IR-induced genetic damage was analyzed. However, no good correlation was found either between ATM protein expression levels and IR-induced MTMs or between ATM protein expression levels and IR-induced MNR in lung cancer patients. other DNA repair genes) could have effect on the cellular response to IR, although the ATM gene was the central component of the system dealing with the cellular response to IR. The IR-induced MTM or IR-induce MNR might not directly relate to the ATM protein expression levels. Therefore, in the future investigations, multiple factors taking part in dealing with cellular response to IR should be studied so as to find factors which nearly relate to IR-induce genetic damage detected with comet assay and/or MN assay.", "", "Inactivation of HSPA1A and telomerase increases residual DNA DSBs post IR exposure, which correlates with increased cell killing, supporting the role of HSPA1A and telomerase in IR-induced DNA damage repair. DNA damage-induced G1/S cell cycle checkpoint activation is almost universally absent in cancer cells, and this absence is frequently caused by mutations in p53 or p53-regulatory processes [ The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene product (ATM) is a protein kinase primarily activated in response to DNA DSBs caused by IR or radiomimetic drugs. Heat does not induce DNA double-strand breaks but rather appears to inhibit repair of DNA damage especially in the case of IR-induced DNA damage, which produces complex closely clustered damage on opposed DNA strands, heat shock pre-irradiation results in delays in completing multi-step repair processes. Hyperthermia is a potent radiosensitizer that has been under clinical investigation as a means to improve the response to IR\u2013based cancer treatments that acts to improve the local tumor control. Hyperthermia itself has several cellular effects that should be synergistic with IR-induced tumor cell killing. Unlike the IR response, neither hypoxic nor plateau-phase cells are resistant to heat-induced cell killing. Clinical trials have shown significant benefits from adding hyperthermia to radiotherapy regimens for a number of malignancies and understanding the mechanisms involved in heat-mediated IR sensitization has become clinically important. Therefore, targeting a combination of tumor specific and DNA repair pathways will not only enhance heat-induced radiosensitization, but will also decrease the overall level of normal tissue toxicity occurring during radiotherapy, which could eventually help to improve sequencing of the heat and IR treatment to obtain a better clinical outcome.", "Two isoforms exist; isoform A, which lacks the twelve amino-acids coded by exon 11 within the carboxy-terminus of the \u03b1-subunit (residues 717-729), or Isoform B that contains the replete amino-acid sequence [ For both the IR and IGF-1R, cleavage of the pro-receptor spawns a 130-kDa \u03b1-chain and a 90-kDa \u03b2-chain. Adding a layer of complexity to the IGF-1R pathway, the \u03b1- and \u03b2-isoforms of IR may associate with the IGF-1R half-receptor to form functionally active hybrid receptors (hybrid-R), mainly when IR and IGF-1R are heavily expressed or imbalanced in their expression, as would be expected to occur following sequential internalization and down-regulation induced by a number of IGF-1R-targeted therapeutic antibodies now undergoing clinical investigation. As will be discussed later, though most drug candidates targeting the IGF-1R pathway were selected for their ability to preferentially inhibit IGF-1R rather than IR (out of concern regarding the perceived and sometimes real risk of hyperglycemia), less stringent binding to also include the hybrid receptors is increasingly considered of potential value. X-ray crystallography has solved the three-dimensional structure of both IR [ As opposed to physiological levels of insulin (0.5 nmol/L), secreted by the pancreatic \u03b2-cells, circulating IGF-1 (20 nmol/L) and IGF-2 (90 nmol/L) can be produced by the liver (under the influence of growth hormone), by malignant tissues themselves, or by their associated stroma; thus, they may stimulate cancers through endocrine, autocrine, or paracrine effects, respectively [ Unlike other tyrosine kinase receptors, like her2/neu for example, gene amplification and/or mutations in the IGF-1R gene are distinctly uncommon, occurring in less than ten percent of breast cancers [ In greater depth, as shown in Given the capacity of IGF-1R to initiate both normal and pathological signaling cascades, IGF-1R and its downstream mediators have, naturally, been widely implicated in contributing to various malignancies and been investigated as potential therapeutic targets now for more than two decades. IGF-1R activation is required for EWS-FLI-1 induced malignant transformation of murine fibroblasts [ Although a mouse monoclonal antibody (\u03b1IR-3) was first shown to be effective against In preclinical animal models using antibodies to IGF-1R, no antibody dependent cellular toxicity (ADCC) or cross-reactivity to the insulin receptor has been observed. For a description of binding specificities for IGF-1R, IR, and/or hybrid receptors [ Notwithstanding a clear benefit observed in a small subset of patients treated with single-agent IGF-1R antagonists, enthusiasm for single-agent IGF-1R targeting has waned and most active or developing clinical trials have evolved to use IGF-1R-targeted therapies together with others that surmount anticipated mechanisms of resistance. At other times, the mechanism(s) of resistance are unique and specific to the individual features that distinguish one cancer from another, as identified for the most common cancer types within Even before the precise mechanisms of single-agent IGF-1R success, and in some cases failure, are thoroughly scrutinized, a limited number of preclinical studies and mostly early phase clinical trials have begun to assess the safety and efficacy of dual targeting of IGF-1R and putative secondary targets suspected of enabling acquired IGF-1R resistance ( An example of intrinsic targeting includes MEDI-573, a dual IGF-1/2 targeted neutralizing antibody that can theoretically prevent activation of both IGF-1R and IGF-1R/IR-A hybrid receptors. Similar in effect, small molecule inhibitors of IR and IGF-1R, such as OSI-906, have generated significant enthusiasm, given anecdotal reports of clinical response [ Of course a number of preclinical and clinical studies utilize a dual-targeting approach aimed at IGF-1R and extrinsic cascade-initiating RTKs or downstream mediators.", "Metabolic changes were assessed in obese children before, during and after puberty to analyse the relationship between IR and puberty in subjects with and without metabolic syndrome. IR was expressed by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) and the ratio of glucose and insulin areas under the curve (AUC-IR). Significantly higher AUC-IR were found in pre-pubertal CMR children compared with nCMR subjects (11.84 \u00b1 1.03 vs. 8.00 \u00b1 0.69; P < 0.01), but no difference was discovered during and after puberty. HOMA-IR differs between CMR and nCMR only in post-puberty (6.03 \u00b1 1.26 vs. 2.54 \u00b1 0.23; P < 0.01). CMR is associated with increased postprandial IR in pre-pubertal and increased fasting IR in post-pubertal obese children.", "Recapitulating the human predisposition, we found that Rb1+/- mice exhibited accelerated development of IR-induced osteosarcoma, with a latency of 39 weeks. Initial exposure of osteoblasts to carcinogenic doses of IR in vitro and in vivo induced RB1-dependent senescence and the expression of a panel of proteins known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), dominated by IL-6. In vivo, IL-6 was required for IR-induced senescence, which elicited NKT cell infiltration and a host inflammatory response. Mice lacking IL-6 or NKT cells had accelerated development of IR-induced osteosarcomas. Our findings indicate that overcoming the immune response to senescence is a rate-limiting step in the formation of IR-induced osteosarcoma.", "In male gerbils, NT-0.5 decreased the ePSA by an average of 10.6\u00b13.0%; however, NT-5.0 significantly increased the ePSA by an average of 31.0\u00b12.5% during the recording periods (drug-time: F On the contrary, both NT-0.5 and NT-5.0 markedly increased the ePSA by an average of 30.5\u00b14.4% and 38.9\u00b12.3%, respectively, in females (drug-time: F Pretreatment with repeated NT-0.5 (s.c. injection, twice/d) for 7 and 28 days following NT-0.5 challenge significantly increased the ePSA in males (16.6\u00b13.3 and 11.2\u00b12.5%, respectively) (drug-time: F To address whether the hippocampal Cx36 and Cx43 expression was associated with sex-related differences in the acute nicotine effect on the ePSA and repeated nicotine-induced sensitization of the synaptic excitability of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we examined acute and repeated nicotine effects on the Cx36 and Cx43 expressions in the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus CA1 area ( In male and female gerbils pretreated with repeated saline (s.c. injection, twice/d) for 7 days, the average number of anti-Cx36 IR dots in a pyramidal neuron and the number of anti-Cx36 IR positive neurons were moderately increased by NT-0.5 challenge, and so, the total number of anti-Cx36 IR dots in a pyramidal layer was significantly increased by acute NT-0.5 challenge in the males (114.8%, p=0.011) and females (142.7%, p=0.017). On the other hand, in male and female gerbils pretreated with repeated NT-0.5 (s.c. injection, twice/d) for 7 days, the total number of anti-Cx36 IR dots was significantly increased by saline and NT-0.5 challenge in males (268.6%, p=0.001 and 401.0%, p=0.001) and females (341.9%, p=0.002 and 406.5%, p=0.001), which resulted from significant increases in the numbers of anti-Cx36 IR dots per neuron and anti-Cx36 IR positive neurons in both groups ( In male gerbils pretreated with repeated saline (s.c. injection, twice/d) for 7 days, the total number of anti-Cx43 IR dots and the average number of anti-Cx43 IR dots per neuron were moderately increased; however, the number of anti-Cx43 IR positive neurons was increased by NT-0.5 challenge (66.8%, p=0.01) ( In female gerbils pretreated with the same dosage regimen, the total number of anti-Cx43 IR dots was significantly increased by NT-0.5 challenge (263.8%, p=0.003), which resulted from increases in the average number of anti-Cx43 IR dots per neuron and the number of anti-Cx43 IR positive neurons. Furthermore, in male and female gerbils pretreated with repeated NT-0.5 (s.c. injection, twice/d) for 7 days, the total number of anti-Cx43 IR dots was significantly increased by saline and NT-0.5 challenge in males (280.1%, p=0.002 and 328.8%, p=0.001) and females (401.4%, p=0.001 and 467.6%, p=0.002), which resulted from significant increases in the average anti-Cx43 IR dots per neuron and the number of anti-Cx43 IR positive neurons ( These results suggest that acute and repeated nicotine administration can increase Cx36 and Cx43 expression in the hippocampus CA1 neurons, with a greater nicotine effect on Cx43 expression in females. Increases of (A) anti-Cx36 and (B) anti-Cx43 IR dots by a challenging NT-0.5 in gerbils pretreated with repeated NT-0.5 injections twice a day for 7 days.", "In both humans and mice, expression of CD80 and CD86 was negatively correlated with the degree of IR and adipose tissue macrophage infiltration. Decreased B7 expression in obesity appeared to directly impair Treg proliferation and function that lead to excessive proinflammatory macrophages and the development of IR. CD80/CD86 double knockout (B7 KO) mice had enhanced adipose macrophage inflammation and IR under both high-fat and normal diet conditions, accompanied by reduced Treg development and proliferation. Adoptive transfer of Tregs reversed IR and adipose inflammation in B7 KO mice. A To investigate a potential role for costimulatory molecules CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) in obesity-induced IR, VAT and SAT isolated from lean and obese humans were used for flow cytometric detection of CD80 and CD86. To investigate the involvement of costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 in obesity and IR, WT and B7 KO (CD80 and CD86 double knockout) mice were fed an HF diet or ND for a duration of 12 weeks. In response to HF diet, both WT and B7 KO mice significantly gained weight compared with ND-fed animals, but the degree of body weight gain was identical in B7 KO and WT animals (48.9 \u00b1 1.2 vs. 49.0 \u00b1 1.3 g; B7 deficiency reduces visceral fat mass, but exacerbates diet-induced IR. Splenocytes harvested from WT and CD80 Prior studies have highlighted the importance of Tregs in obesity and IR, with studies suggesting reduced local differentiation of Tregs as a critical determinant of heightened innate immune responses ( Loss of B7 reduces Treg in mice. To further confirm whether enhanced IR in B7 KO mice is dependent on the decrease of Tregs, CD4 Adoptive transfer of Treg restores insulin sensitivity in B7 KO mice. Adipose inflammation and IR were evaluated after 12 weeks. Most of the obese patients were on antidiabetic medication due to morbid obesity and the blood glucose and HbA Prior studies have implicated CD28 and CTLA-4 in Treg development ( We next demonstrated that B7-deficient APCs displayed a reduced ability to promote Treg proliferation, differentiation from thymocytes, and conversion from Foxp3 Understanding the mechanisms underlying obesity-induced inflammation and IR is of critical importance in designing novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.", "We examined whether VEGF or ICPP can influence IR outcome in vivo in mice. In IR, both the proteins administered intravenously at reperfusion reduced infarct size (IS) by 57% for VEGF and 52% for ICPP (P < 0.01). IR triggered mitochondrial pore opening and impaired mitochondrial respiratory function. These effects of IR were prevented by VEGF or ICPP, which increased mitochondrial calcium retention capacity by 37% compared with saline (P < 0.05) and improved mitochondrial respiratory function (by 71% and 65%, respectively for state 3, and 51% and 38% for state 4, P < 0.01 for VEGF). Thus, intravenous administration of VEGF or ICPP at reperfusion largely reduces IS in IR, through stimulation of VEGFR2 receptors. This effect is mediated, at least in part, by improvement of IR-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.", "", "The objective of this study is to determine if plasma total and HMW adiponectin concentrations underlie ethnic-specific differences in IR. The homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) assessed IR. South Asians had the greatest HOMA-IR, followed by Aboriginals, Chinese, and Europeans ( For each given decrease in HMW adiponectin concentrations a greater increase in HOMA-IR is observed in Aboriginals, Chinese, and South Asians than Europeans. Ethnic-specific differences in HMW adiponectin may account for differences in IR. Circulating adiponectin concentrations are inversely proportional to adiposity [ Few studies have explored ethnic-specific differences in the relationship between adiponectin and IR and the findings have been inconsistent. One investigation reported no relationship in South Asian and European South Africans [ Furthermore, despite the evidence of ethnic-specific differences in body fat distribution [ The objectives of this study are: i) to explore ethnic-specific differences in the relationship between adiposity (body composition and body fat distribution) and plasma total and HMW adiponectin concentrations; and ii) to investigate whether ethnicity modifies the relationship of plasma total and HMW adiponectin concentrations with IR independently of visceral adiposity in a multi-ethnic population of Aboriginals, Chinese, Europeans, and South Asians. Leisure-time physical activity was assessed as the average minutes per week of activity over the previous year (self-report) as previously described [ Insulin resistance was calculated using the previously validated homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) [ Body mass index was calculated by body weight (kg)/height (m) Plasma total and HMW adiponectin concentrations were quantified using a commercially available ELISA (ALPCO Diagnostics, Salem, NH). Of the 822 potentially available M-CHAT study participants, we excluded 188 because of lack of information on HOMA-IR, total- or HMW adiponectin, which left 634 individuals for our analyses. Distribution of continuous variables was explored for normality, and variables that were not normally distributed (HOMA-IR, total- and HMW-adiponectin, VAT, SAT, physical activity) were natural logarithm (ln) transformed. The relationship between total and HMW adiponectin (independent variables) and HOMA-IR (dependent variable) was examined using linear regression. We explored interactions of ethnicity with both total and HMW adiponectin in order to explore whether ethnicity modifies the relationship between adiponectin and IR. While ethnicity was found not to modify the association between total adiponectin and IR (ethnicity by total adiponectin interaction, p = 0.431), the ethnicity by HMW adiponectin interaction was found significant (p = 0.010). Therefore, the relationship between total adiponectin and IR was explored on a total sample after adjusting for ethnicity and other covariates of interest (age, sex, family history of diabetes mellitus, education, smoking status, physical activity, total dietary energy intake, BMI and WHR). Ethnic specific differences in the relationship between HMW adiponectin and IR were also explored using linear regression including the interaction term and adjusting for the above-mentioned covariates. To evaluate whether the association of total- and HMW- adiponectin concentrations with HOMA-IR was independent of VAT, models were additionally adjusted for VAT. Results are considered significant if Significant ethnic-specific differences in age, education, current smoking, physical activity, dietary energy intake, measures of adiposity, plasma glucose concentrations, and HOMA-IR were observed (Table Characteristics of study participants by ethnic group Continuous data presented as mean (95% CI). A significant inverse association between plasma total adiponectin concentration and HOMA-IR was found after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, family history of diabetes mellitus, education, smoking status, physical activity, dietary total energy intake, BMI, and WHR (Model 1) (Table Association between total adiponectin and HOMA-IR Outcome variable is ln HOMA-IR. We further determined whether ethnicity modifies the relationship of plasma total and HMW adiponectin concentrations with IR, independent of visceral adiposity. We also found that plasma total and HMW adiponectin concentrations are inversely associated with HOMA-IR and that inclusion of VAT in the model only slightly attenuated the relationship. Most interestingly, we found that ethnicity modified the relationship between HMW adiponectin and IR in that for every decrease in HMW adiponectin concentration a greater increase in HOMA-IR was observed in Aboriginals, Chinese, and South Asians than in Europeans. This ethnic-specific effect was not observed for the relationship between total adiponectin and IR. Adiponectin is an insulin-sensitizing adipocytokine that may be a mediating factor that underlies ethnic-specific differences in IR. A study in isolated epididymal rat adipocytes incubated with globular recombinant adiponectin reported that adiponectin facilitated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake via the activation of AMP-kinase pathway [ In the current study we also considered body fat distribution and specifically we were interested in investigating the interplay between adiponectin and VAT as predictors of HOMA-IR because of the evidence supporting a strong inverse association between adiponectin and VAT [ Our study has some limitations. We used HOMA-IR to assess IR, which is inferior to the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp method to assess IR. However, the use of HOMA-IR as a surrogate marker of IR is less invasive and more feasible in large population studies [ In summary, the relationship between plasma HMW adiponectin and HOMA-IR is influenced by ethnicity with the greater effect observed for Aboriginals, Chinese, and South Asians compared to Europeans. Even after adjustment for VAT, the association between adiponectin and HOMA-IR remained significant, suggesting that adiponectin plays a role in IR across different ethnic groups independent of VAT. ANOVA: Analysis of variance; CI: Confidence interval; HOMA-IR: Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance; HMW: High molecular weight; IR: Insulin resistance; M-CHAT: Multicultural-community health assessment Trial; SAT: Subcutaneous adipose tissue; VAT: Visceral adipose tissue; WC: Waist circumference; WHR: Waist-hip ratio.", "TRPV1 is a marker of polymodal nociceptor neurons that is expressed by the majority of bladder afferent neurons (Bennett et al., In sacral DRG, 70.6 \u00b1 3.1% of FG-labeled neurons contained TRPV1-IR and 54.2 \u00b1 2.5% contained CGRP-IR ( We next investigated the co-expression of GFR\u03b11-, GFR\u03b13-, and CGRP-IR with TRPV1-IR in bladder afferent neurons (Figures DRG sections immunostained with either ER\u03b1 antibody labeled the nucleus of a subpopulation of neurons; neurons with a nucleus brighter than the cytoplasm were regarded as ER\u03b1-IR. Assessment of FG-labeled neurons labeled with this antibody showed that in sacral and lumbar DRGs, 29.6 \u00b1 3.9% and 39.4 \u00b1 1.2%, respectively, were immunoreactive for ER\u03b1 ( Using the antibody from Affinity, ER\u03b1-IR neurons were then categorized according to their co-expression with GFR\u03b11, GFR\u03b13, CGRP, TRPV1, and NF200 (Figures The expression of ER\u03b1 has not previously been compared between myelinated and unmyelinated bladder sensory neurons. Using the same ER\u03b1 antibody as above (from Affinity) and immunoreactivity for NF200 to indicate myelination, we found that in sacral DRGs only ~25% of myelinated bladder neurons were labeled for ER\u03b1-IR; even fewer (~15%) of this population expressed ER\u03b1 in lumbar DRGs (Figures The ER\u03b1 antibody obtained from Millipore produced a similar pattern of IR in the nucleus of DRG neurons as that obtained by Affinity, however, the Millipore antibody labeled fewer bladder afferent neurons. It was rare to find bladder sensory neurons that co-expressed ER\u03b1 with GFR\u03b13- or CGRP-IR in either lumbar or sacral DRG. Specifically, at this spinal level ~25% GFR\u03b11-IR bladder sensory neurons contained ER\u03b1-IR, and these comprised approximately half of all ER\u03b1-IR neurons. Lumbar bladder sensory neurons showed less expression of ER\u03b1 using the Millipore antibody, with only ~5% of GFR\u03b11-IR neurons containing ER\u03b1-IR, and these comprising ~10% of all ER\u03b1-IR neurons. Previous studies have reported that just over half of all bladder afferent neurons express the myelination marker, NF200-IR (Hayashi et al., We then performed double-labeling studies to determine if myelinated bladder sensory neurons express nitric oxide synthase (NOS), CGRP, GFR\u03b11, or ER\u03b1 (using both sources of ER\u03b1 antisera). Assessment of FG-labeled neurons in sacral and lumbar DRG for the other neuronal classes (CGRP, GFR\u03b11, and ER\u03b1) showed that each class comprised both myelinated (NF200-IR) and unmyelinated (NF200-negative) neurons, however, their relative distributions between these populations differed (Figures NOS activity has been linked to plasticity of visceral afferent pathways and is expressed in some bladder afferent neurons (Vizzard et al., At each spinal level, ~40% of CGRP-IR bladder neurons were NF200-IR (Figure Expression of ER\u03b1 relative to myelination status was more complex, showing differences between spinal levels and between the two ER\u03b1 antibodies (Figures FG-labeled neurons were assessed for presence of the transcription factor, ATF-3. It has previously been shown that populations of bladder sensory neurons express receptors for GDNF and artemin (i.e., GFR\u03b11 and GFR\u03b13, respectively) (Forrest and Keast, Both groups of bladder sensory neurons (GFR\u03b11- and GFR\u03b13-IR) include neurons that could be considered nociceptive by their expression of TRPV1. These comprise a minority of the GFR\u03b11-IR bladder afferents and the majority of GFR\u03b13-IR bladder afferents. This raises the possibility that NOS upregulation is occurring in the ATF-3-IR neurons. Our study has also identified a sub-population of NOS-IR sacral sensory neurons that are likely to be undergoing structural remodeling during acute inflammation of the bladder.", "Precondition of mice with 4 mg/kg of dexamethasone significantly attenuated IR-induced injury as manifested by the improved renal function along with ameliorated pathological changes and suppressed inflammatory infiltration. Attenuated PI3K/AKT signaling thus suppresses inflammatory response which then protects kidneys from IR-induced injury. All together, our data support that dexamethasone could be a good alternative therapy for prevention and treatment of IR-induced renal injury in the clinical practice.", "recently reported that mouse BM HSCs, particularly those in quiescence, repaired IR-induced DSBs more efficiently via the NHEJ pathway than mouse BM HPCs using the \u03b3H2AX foci and alkaline comet assays Currently, the \u03b3H2AX foci assay is the most widely used method to analyze DSBs and DSB repair Unfortunately, the conventional cell free Here, we report the development of a qPCR-based cell free More importantly, using this assay, we found that the nuclear protein extracts from human HSCs had a lower level of NHEJ activity than those from HPCs.", "Initial studies mapped ITF IR following involuntary modes of alcohol administration in animals (i.e., intraperitoneal injections, vapor inhalation or intragastric intubation) ( In order to further confirm the potential contribution of Ucn1 and EWcp, the laboratory of Dr. Andrey E. Ryabinin has performed a series of genetic studies analyzing levels of Ucn1 immunoreactivity in rodent strains differing in their predisposition to consume alcohol.", "We examined the protective effects of NR on regional IR in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocyte monolayers. In a previous study, The aims of this study were: (1) to investigate the effects of NR on IR arrhythmias and calcium cycling stability during regional IR in cardiomyocyte cultures, and (2) to investigate the effects of NR on mitochondrial membrane potential during IR. Myocytes were isolated with the use of a Percoll (Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) gradient and plated at a density of 1.5\u00d710 Regional IR in NRVM monolayers was performed as previously described with modifications. Mitochondria play an important role during IR arrhythmias. The main findings of our work are that NR promoted resistance to IR and its arrhythmogenic consequences via several mechanisms: 1) NR promotes stability of Ca cycling during regional IR; 2) NR decreases reperfusion arrhythmias; 3) NR preserves mitochondrial polarization during prolonged IR. The implications of this finding, if confirmed in larger animals Arguably, Ca cycling derangements are central to the electrophysiological destabilization and ensuing arrhythmias during IR. The combination of prolonged Ca transients, intracellular Ca overload, shortened action potential duration, and intercellular uncoupling (due to closure of gap junctions) all conspire to create an arrhythmogenic milieu during IR. The resistance to IR observed in the NR monolayers is likely to be multifactorial. Our study lend further support to the mitochondria as central mediator of the beneficial effects of NR, and expands the previous knowledge to include protective effects in IR arrhythmias and mediated by stable Ca cycling. Ca transient duration (CaD, top) and time decay constant (TAU, bottom) during IR in control (red) versus nutrient restriction (NR, black) monolayers.

Recent data suggest that non-toxic concentrations of inhaled carbon monoxide (CO) can reduce IR mediated injury in the heart ( These experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that inhaled CO may reduce tissue injury in a murine model of hind limb ischemia reperfusion ( All experimental procedures were approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital\u2019s Institutional Review Board and were in accordance with To determine whether inhalation of 250 ppm CO resulted in increased blood carboxyhemoglobin levels, a group of non-ischemic animals was subjected to 20% oxygen, balance nitrogen with and without 250 ppm CO for a total of either 4.5 or 7.5 hours. On three separate 20 minute intervals 48 hours prior to the IR experiments, mice were acclimatized to measurement of tail blood pressure without anesthesia by placing them inside the heated holder (37\u00b0C) of the Coda2 blood pressure system (Kent Scientific, Torrington, CN). However, at 7.5hrs IR (CO:55,262\u00b15118 vs Air:36,331\u00b17,065 IDV, **p=0.03, n=10, After 7.5 hours of IR in the presence of inhaled CO or room air followed by 24 hours reperfusion in room air, HO-1 protein expression was markedly increased by 24 hours reperfusion compared to sham (CO: 1.4\u00b10.2 vs CO sham: 0.19\u00b10.01 ng/mg, **p<0.001, n=10; Air: 0.83\u00b10.13 vs air sham: 0.17\u00b10.006 ng/mg protein, +p<0.001, n=10, There was no significant difference in total p38 MAPK expression in mice treated with CO or room air for 7.5 hours sham conditions or 7.5 hours I/R ( Myeloperoxidase levels were markedly increased in CO treated mice as compared to mice exposed to IR during ischemia reperfusion (48.8\u00b16.3 vs 25.8\u00b13.3 ng/mg total protein, p=0.007, n=10, CO treatment did not alter the amount of edema found in reperfused skeletal muscle 24 hours following limb ischemia (6.3\u00b10.11 vs. 6.4 \u00b1 0.3, p =0.75, n= 10). It is important to note that the CO protocol used for these experiments was substantially different from the organ transplant IR models. In the transplant models of liver and renal tissue IR, CO treatment has been usually initiated one hour prior to the onset of tissue ischemia and is continued for up to 24 hours reperfusion ( The level of carboxyhemoglobin in the blood of mice subjected to CO treatment in this experimental protocol was comparable to levels reported in studies of rodent liver and myocardial ischemia reperfusion where administration of CO proved to provide cytoprotection ( Additional analysis of local and systemic cytokine release, which has been associated with mortality and morbidity during vascular reconstruction in humans( \u03b1-Tubulin levels were preserved in the skeletal muscle of mice that inhaled CO during ischemia reperfusion when compared to mice exposed to room air under the same conditions ( After 7.5 hours of IR, there was no difference in the level of heme oxygenase-1 expression in skeletal muscle of CO treated and untreated mice ( Despite the decrease in muscle fiber injury, preserved cytoskeletal muscle protein, decreased skeletal muscle and serum cytokines in mice exposed to IR in the presence of CO, skeletal muscle MPO levels were actually higher in the CO treated mice than in the control mice ( CO inhalation therapy in our model did not lower skeletal muscle edema. However, decreased skeletal muscle edema is not always associated with decreased skeletal muscle injury ( Similar to the results of the analysis of skeletal muscle edema, there was no significant difference in blood pressure in the CO treated vs. control treated mice at 6 and 24 hours ( The precise mechanisms contributing to CO mediated cytoprotection of skeletal muscle exposed to IR have not been defined at this point. However, examination into the precise mechanisms on how CO protects skeletal muscle from IR injury requires further investigation. CO breathing preserved IR induced decreases in \u03b1-Tubulin at 7.5 hours ischemia reperfusion (**p=0.03) and 24 hours reperfusion (+p=0.04). IR stimulated HO expression in skeletal muscle by 24 hours reperfusion during IR (*,+p<0.01). CO breathing during IR resulted in significantly greater HO expression by 24 hours reperfusion as compared to mice who breathed room air during IR(*p=0.03).", "We have previously shown that H Intestinal sections from neonates undergoing bowel resections (control=3, NEC=20) were analyzed for IGF-IR expression. NEC was induced in newborn mouse pups using hypoxia and hyperosmolar feeds, and distal small bowel segments were analyzed for IGF-IR expression (control=3, NEC=7). H An increased IGF-IR expression was noted in intestinal sections from NEC as well as murine model of NEC. H IGF-IR-mediated activation of intracellular signaling may play a critical role during oxidative stress-induced apoptosis during NEC. Some of the ROS species are extremely unstable, degrade quickly, and may not pose a significant injury to a cell; however, others, such as hydrogen peroxide (H Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease of premature infants with significant morbidity and mortality; the exact pathogenesis of NEC remains largely unknown [ IGF-1/IGF type I receptor (IGF-IR)-triggered signaling is essential for the regulation of tissue formation and remodeling, prenatal growth, brain development, and muscle metabolism. Cellular growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival against apoptosis are among the well-described biological actions of IGF-1 signaling, and when impaired, may contribute to the pathogenesis of human diseases and reduced fetal growth in-utero [ The IGF-1/IGF-IR signaling may play a critical role in survival of the premature neonates who are shown to have low levels of circulating serum IGF-1 associated with increased risk of multiple disabilities, including retinopathy of prematurity and NEC [ Rat intestinal epithelial (RIE)-1 cells (a gift from Dr. Kenneth D. Brown; Cambridge Research Station, Cambridge, U.K.) were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and cultured at 37\u00b0C under an atmosphere containing 5% CO Paraffin-embedded intestinal sections from 20 neonates with NEC and 3 neonates with non-inflammatory condition (intestinal atresia) of the gastrointestinal tract (control) undergoing bowel resection were analyzed. Sections were incubated with rabbit anti-IGF-IR overnight at 4\u00b0C, then incubated with an anti-rabbit secondary antibody and stained with DAB chromogen (Dako Cytomation EnVision\u00ae+ System-HRP (DAB) kit, Carpinteria, CA). Tissue lysates prepared from full-thickness mouse intestines were clarified by centrifugation (13000\u00d7 RIE-1 cells were transfected with either IGF-IR small interference (si) RNA targeted at IGF-IF or non-targeting control (NTC) and plated in 24-well plates for 24 h before H To evaluate for oxidative stress-induced changes in IGF-IR expression, RIE-1 and FHs74 Int cells treated with H To further analyze IGF-IR transactivation and signal transduction activation during H For Results are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM. IGF-IR expression was noted in the mucosal tips of healthy human neonatal intestines, as assessed by immunohistochemical analysis ( Next, we examined IGF-IR expression levels To validate our neonatal intestinal section data, we examined the effects of oxidative stress on IGF-IR expression both The immunofluorescent analysis of RIE-1 using our NEC Next, we sought to quantify the cell surface membrane expression of IGF-IR after oxidative stress in RIE-1 cells ( In order to demonstrate IGF-IR transactivation during oxidative stress in intestinal epithelial cells, we used IGF-IR tyrosine phosphorylation array designed to elucidate which SH2 domain-containing molecules become recruited to the tyrosine kinase domain of IGF-IR during H The SH2 domains are found in enzymes, adaptor proteins, regulatory subunits of signaling proteins, scaffold proteins, transcription factors and oncogenic proteins. These proteins play a critical role by acting as adaptors between receptors and downstream signaling molecules, transmitting signals within a cell and regulating the kinase activity of specific proteins in different cell types [ We have previously demonstrated that H In this study, we demonstrate significant upregulation of IGF-IR expression in the gut during NEC. We also show correlative IGF-IR expression in neonatal intestinal NEC sections, murine Enhanced IGF-IR upregulation and signaling have been described in various cancer cell lines; however, the exact role of IGF-IR has not been elucidated in NEC. Previous IGF-IR is a tetramer with extracellular ligand-binding and intracellular autophosphorylating tyrosine kinase domains which becomes activated with IGF-1 ligand binding. Activated receptor phosphorylates tyrosines within its kinase domain and tyrosines outside of the kinase domain, creating high-affinity docking sites for the binding of a number of intracellular signaling proteins that share highly conserved SH2 phosphotyrosine-binding domains, enabling the proteins that contain them to bind to activated IGF-IR tyrosine kinases. This poses a significant challenge in studying receptor-specific signaling pattern; therefore, we have used IGF-IR-specific antibodies and IGF-IR-specific tyrosine phosphorylation array. We elucidated the H Adaptor proteins recruited to phosphorylated IGF-IR tyrosine kinase domain during oxidative stress in RIE-1 cells included Dramatic IGR-IR staining of myenteric plexus in human NEC sections and Oxidative stress plays an important role in cellular homeostasis and pathology. Many growth-factor receptors have been shown to undergo enhanced phosphorylation in response to oxidant stimulation [ Notable upregulation in intestinal IGF-IR expression during NEC and RIE-1 cells (1\u00d710", "Immunoprecipitaion (IP) assays and ELISA confirmed the presence of IGF1R/IR heterodimeric receptors in figitumumab-sensitive cells. We next found that both IGF1R and IR were N-linked glyosylated in figitumumab-sensitive cells. The data suggest that the level of N-linked glycosylated IGF1R/IR heterodimeric receptor is highly associated with sensitivity to anti-IGF1R antibody in cancer cells. Interestingly, we found that figitumumab-sensitive cancer cells all overexpressed IGF1R; basal expression levels of IR were also much higher compared to that in other resistant cells ( A) Immunoblot analysis of total IGF1R\u03b2 and IR\u03b2 protein levels. Two types of gastric and hepatocellular carcinoma cells were harvested 24 h after plating and immunoblotting with anti-IGF1R\u03b2 antibody, anti-IR\u03b2 antibody, and anti-\u03b1 tubulin antibody was performed. B) Analysis of the presence of IGF1R/IR heterodimeric receptor (HRs) using immunoprecipitation. Total cellular proteins (1 mg) from cells were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-IGF1R antibody, separated by SDS-PAGE at constant voltage (80 V), and Western blotted with an anti-IR\u03b2 antibody. The blot was then stripped and reprobed with anti-IGF1R\u03b2 antibody C) Quantitative analysis of IGF1R homodimer, IR homodimer, and IGF1R/IR heterodimer levels using an ELISA. Lysis buffer (100 \u00b5L) containing equal amount of proteins (50 \u00b5g/well) from 11 cancer cell lines including MCF7 cells (positive control) were plated on anti-IGF1R antibody-coated wells and detected with an anti-IR detection antibody. Anti-IR antibody-coated wells, IR protein standards, and the anti-IR detection antibody were used as standards in the heterodimeric receptor ELISA. D) Effect of figitumumab on IGF1- mediated IGF1R/IR HRs. Since it is commonly known that IGF1R and IR can form heterodimers when both are co-overexpressed due to their highly homologous structures We also quantitatively measured IGF1R, IR, and IGF1R/IR HR levels using specific ELISAs with antibodies that specifically recognize IGF1R or IR and do not cross-react with each other. Abbreviation: IGF1R = Insulin like growth factor 1 receptor; IR = Insulin receptor; HR = Heterodimeric receptor; GC = Gastric cancer; HCC = Hepatocellular carcinoma; BC = Breast cancer. To further define the mechanism of anti-proliferative figitumumab activity related to IGF1R/IR heterodimer expression, we also examined changes in ligand-dependent heterodimeric receptor expression ( To evaluate whether the effect of figitumumab was restricted to SNU719, HepG2, or SNU368 cells, we performed studies in cells with low expression levels of IR, including SNU739 and SNU886 cells, transfected with pcDNA3.1-IR which induced high expression of IR. As shown in A) Effect of IR transfection on IGF1R/IR HR levels in IR-negative cell lines. Cells were transfected with the pcDNA3.1(-) expression vector containing wild-type IR cDNA. An equal amount of lysates from cells transfected with either the empty vector or pcDNA3.1(-) containing IR cDNA was subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-IGF1R antibody followed by Western blot analyses of IR\u03b2 and IGF1R\u03b2. B) Effect of IR-transfection on figitumumab sensitivity. Solid triangle symbol with dashed lines = empty vector (pcDNA3.1-), Solid circle symbols with lines = pcDNA3.1(-) IR. B) Analysis of N-glycosylated IR\u03b2 and IGF1R\u03b2 in sensitive cell lines by enzymic deglycosylation with PNGage F. All samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 12 h with PNGage F. IGF1R\u03b2 and IR\u03b2 proteins were analyzed in parallel by Western blotting. C) Effect of N913Q site mutation on the formation of IGF1R/IR heterodimeric receptors. An equal amount of the cell lysate from transfected cells was then subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-IGF1R antibody followed by Western blot analysis for IR\u03b2 and IGF1R\u03b2. As shown in Interestingly, it seems that removal of N-linked sugars from N913 of the IGF1R had no apparent effect on the formations of IGF1R/IR HRs. Data from the present study suggest that the level of IGF1R/IR HRs can be a possible diagnostic biomarker for predicting sensitivity to anti-IGF1R antibody, particularly in GC and HCC cells. Previous studies have reported that the level of IGF1R itself may have predictive value in breast, lung, and colorectal cancers Although the physiological role of IGF1R/IR HRs is still unclear, a number of previous studies have indicated that they play major roles that may be more important than that of IGF1R Aside from the association between HRs and figitumumab sensitivity, our results showed that NLG of the IGF1R and IR was another important indicator of drug sensitivity. We found that IGF1R\u03b2 and IR\u03b2 showed an upward shifting on SDS-PAGE in all three figitumumab-sensitive cells compared to resistant cells ( Recently, a recent phase III trial of figitumumab administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel failed to demonstrate survival benefit in advanced NSCLC patients. showed that higher pre-treatment levels of fIGF1 (>1 ng/mL) were predictive of the clinical benefit derived from the use of figitumumab with chemotherapy in NSCLC patients In conclusion, data from the present study suggested that N-linked glycosylated IGF1R/IR HR levels can be a biomarker for predicting the response to figitumumab. For example, we might be able to evaluate the levels of NLG IGF1Rs, IRs, and HRs in tissue samples from GC or HCC patients who respond favorably to figitumumab therapy using immunohistochemistry-based assays. This could confirm whether the level of functional membrane-bound IGF1R/IR HRs is an important predictor of sensitivity and responsiveness to targeted anti-IGF1R antibody-based therapy. The membranes were incubated in blocking solution containing 1% nonfat dry milk and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature and probed overnight at 4\u00b0C with antibodies against p-IGF1R\u03b2 (pY-1131/1146, dilution 1\u2236500), p-IR\u03b2 (pY-1361, dilution 1\u2236500), p-IRS(pS302, dilution 1\u2236500), p-STAT3 (pY-705, dilution 1\u22361000), p-AKT (pS-473, dilution 1\u22361000), p-ERK (pThr-202/Tyr-204, dilution 1\u22361000), IGF1R\u03b2, IR\u03b2, STAT3, AKT, and ERK, which were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverley, MA). Anti-IRS antibody was obtained from BD (San Jose, CA). Immunoprecipitated and total (input) protein samples were then resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blotted with an anti-IR\u03b2 antibody and an anti-IGF1R\u03b2 antibody. Custom siRNA specific for IGF1R (target sequence: Star IGF1R and IR ELISA kits were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Proteins from all samples (50 \u00b5g/well) and quantification of IR and IGF1R were performed, according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. To quantify HRs, reagents from both the IR and IGF1R ELISA kits were used in combination. Anti-IR antibody-coated wells, IR protein standards, and the anti-IR detection antibody were used as standards for detecting HRs in the ELISAs. The extracted peptide samples from the in-gel digestion were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis on an LTQ-velos (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA), coupled on-line with a nano-HPLC system (Proxyon, Copenhagen, Denmark), and equipped with a reversed-phase microcapillary electrospray ionization system Full-length IR cDNA (accession number BC117172) from pCR-XL TOPO (Thermo Scientific, Huntsville, AL) was isolated by double digestion with HindIII/XbaI (New England Biolab, Ipswich, MA) and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1- (Invitrogen).", "Aidi injection (15 \u00b5g/ml) induced G2/M phase arrest efficiently in the cell line after 48 h. The expression of cyclin B1 decreased in the group treated with IR and Aidi injection compared with either of those with IR or Aidi injection alone. The expression of Wee1 increased in the group treated with IR and Aidi injection compared with that in the groups treated with either IR or Aidi injection alone.", "We quantified 11,509 phosphorylation sites in cells treated with IR and 11,540 phosphorylation sites in etoposide-treated cells that were localized to a specific amino acid within the modified peptide sequence with high confidence (site-specific localization probability > 75%; mean 0.95; ). We plotted the logarithmized SILAC ratios of nonphosphorylated peptides and determined the ratio corresponding to the 99% quantile (corresponding to a fold change of 1.85 for etoposide and 1.64 for IR; B). Applying these statistical filters, we extracted 1470 high confidence phosphorylation sites (combined from etoposide and IR experiments) that were upregulated after DNA damage (). Even with these relaxed criteria, only few sites showed increased acetylation within 1 hr after IR treatment, suggesting a slower kinetics of this modification compared to phosphorylation. This revealed that IR-induced CYLD Ser-418 phosphorylation peaked \u223c1 hr after IR treatment and remained detectable at least 6 hr afterwards (B). Comparing cells overexpressing CYLD with nontransfected cells showed that CYLD overexpression diminished nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB upon IR treatment (C). Stimulating cells with TNF-\u03b1 or treating them with IR induced NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity, and in each case this induction was impaired by CYLD overexpression (D). Moreover, detection of PPM1G with this antibody increased when cells were treated with etoposide or IR (A). Notably, although THRAP3 detection by the phospho-specific antibody was observed in extracts of untreated cells, it was increased when cells were treated with the DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) or with various DNA-damaging agents, including etoposide, IR, and the UV-mimetic agent 4-nitroquinoline oxide (4NQO) (A and 6B).", "IR appears to be a dominant underlying cause of accelerated atherosclerosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). HCV can induce IR directly through the stimulation of SOCS3 and PPA2, and both of these molecules have been shown to inhibit interferon-\u03b1 signaling. Improvement of insulin sensitivity may increase the response rate to antiviral treatment and prevent IR complications, including vascular diseases. Beside the association between HCV and IR, the published data also have showed the possible association of HCV core and NS5A protein with IR. It is important for cell growth, cell differentiation, protein synthesis, and maintenance of glucose levels in the body [ Insulin-signaling pathway begins when insulin binds to the extracellular \u03b1 subunit of insulin receptor substrate (IRS), which further phosphorylates the intracellular tyrosine-kinase domain of the \u03b2 subunit of the insulin receptor. This phosphorylation produces docking sites for many other proteins having SH2 (Src homology 2) domains like phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3k) [ HCV core protein has been reported to induce overexpression of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in the liver of transgenic mice and human hepatoma cell lines [ The nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) of HCV plays a significant role in virus-driven IR. HCV NS5A and increased endoplasmic reticulum stress in HCV infection contributes to overexpression of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) [ IR is mainly categorized into 2 types-HCV-induced IR and lifestyle-associated IR. Pathogenesis of HCV-induced insulin resistance is different from that of lifestyle-associated IR [ IR plays a pivotal role in accelerating the severity of hepatic fibrosis in HCV-infected patients [ Liver steatosis is frequently observed in patients with CHCV infection [ A number of risk factors, such as male sex, age, cirrhotic liver, and alcohol consumption are involved in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in HCV-infected patients [ Resistance to antiviral treatment is another serious problem associated with HCV-induced IR [ In this review, we have summarized the association between HCV and IR and also have analyzed the possible association of HCV core and NS5A protein with IR. IR is mainly categorized into 2 types-HCV-induced IR and lifestyle-associated IR. The pathogenesis of HCV-induced IR is different from that of lifestyle-associated IR. Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of death in the case of lifestyle-associated IR, and HCV-associated IR is responsible for many HCV-related conditions such as hepatic fibrosis, antiviral-drug resistance, steatosis, and hepatocarcinogenesis. IR arises from the impairment of the insulin-signaling pathway at multiple steps. Various studies have reported that the core protein of HCV induces IR mainly by modulating the insulin-signaling pathway at the level of IRS. In the case of core proteins of genotype 3a, degradation of IRS-1 is mediated by the downregulation of PPAR\u03b3 production and upregulation of SOCS-7 production; in contrast genotype 1b's core protein activates mTOR. HCV NS5A and increased endoplasmic reticulum stress in HCV infection contributes to the overexpression of PP2A, which leads to the impairment of interferon signaling, and is thus responsible for poor response to interferon therapy for treating IR in HCV-infected patients. Since the exact mechanisms of the molecular pathways of HCV-induced IR have not yet been understood, further research is required to determine how virus-induced IR can be managed.", "We found that ST6Gal I was cleaved by BACE1 (\u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme), which was specifically overexpressed in response to IR. A variety of molecules contribute to cancer progression and metastasis [ \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme (BACE) is a membrane-bound aspartic protease that cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease [ In the present study, we examined IR-induced cleavage and solubilization of ST6Gal I, which is released into the cell culture media of colon cancer cell lines, and sought to identify the protease involved in cleaving ST6Gal I after exposure to IR. We found that BACE1 could be the secretase responsible for IR-induced cleavage of ST6Gal I, and showed that BACE1 mediated cleavage of ST6Gal I decreased ST6Gal I -mediated cancer cell migration. Statistical significance was determined using Student's In our previous study, we found that IR exposure induces ST6Gal I cleavage and produces a soluble form of ST6Gal I in SW480 colon cancer cells [ It was previously demonstrated that replacement of ST6Gal I residues Leu37 and Lys40 with alanine significantly decreases BACE1-mediated cleavage of ST6Gal I [ Integrin \u03b21, a known substrate of ST6Gal I [ Next, we compared the effects of ST6Gal I WT and \u0394N on integrin \u03b21 sialylation, integrin \u03b21-mediated signaling, and cell migration. Expression of either WT or \u0394N increased the levels of the Tyr410-phosphorylated (active) form of p130CAS (p-p130CAS Our previous study indicated that IR induces ST6Gal I cleavage and secretion of a soluble form of ST6Gal I [ In the present study, we showed that IR induced cleavage and secretion of the soluble form of ST6Gal I by increasing BACE-1 expression, an effect that may contribute to IR-induced migration of colon cancer cells, which phenomena is independent of integrin \u03b21 sialylation that was usually mediated by Golgi-anchored ST6Gal I. Our previous study suggested that IR increases the expression of ST6Gal I, which, in turn, is involved in radioresistance and radiation-induced migration via sialylation of integrin \u03b21 [ BACE-1, which is a crucial protease in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, is highly expressed in the brain, but it is also expressed at low levels in peripheral tissues. In colon cancer cells, IR increased the expression of BACE1, which is involved in IR-mediated cleavage of ST6Gal I (Figure Therefore, it could be suggested that a transfer of sialic acids that is independent of integrin \u03b21 sialylation might be involved in soluble ST6Gal I-mediated migration and activation of p130CAS.", "The main purpose of the present study was to clarify the effect of PS1 phosphorylation on IR/insulin signaling. Here, we demonstrate that the pseudo-phosphorylation mutant of PS1 inhibited IR transcription and reduced IR expression compared with wild-type PS1. Importantly, there was a decrease in expression of IR in AD brains, and the phosphorylation ratio of PS1 was negatively correlated with IR level in human brain samples. In the data from mouse models of AD, IR reduction was not observed at the pre-A\u03b2 deposition stage but became apparent in that of post-A\u03b2 deposition.", "We engineered BaF3 cells to express exogenous p21 and tested whether overexpressing p21 in cells irradiated in the absence of IL-3 protects from IR-induced apoptosis. Enforced p21 expression resulted in a consistent, but partial, protection of cells from undergoing IR-induced apoptosis. However, deregulating E2F activity through expression of HPV E7 failed to sensitize cells to IR-induced apoptosis in the presence of IL-3.", "Englitazone did not increase IR, IRS-1/IRS-2, pp60, or MAPK phosphorylation, nor did it enhance insulin's stimulation of these parameters.", "Although UV exposure strikingly induced JNK activity in both cells, the dose-response increase following IR exposure was observed in thyroid cells with the maximal JNK activity (3.5 fold induction) obtained at 10 Gy exposure, but no increase in WI-38 cells. Our results demonstrate that IR stimulates JNK activity in cultured human thyroid cells but not in fibroblasts indicating distinct activation and regulation mechanisms of JNK cascade. The JNK activation following IR exposure is mediated at least partially through a PKC-dependent pathway.", "Some of these proteins have been shown to also be substrates of both the IGFIR and IR. Phosphorylation of IRS-1 results in recruitment of SH2 domain containing proteins, including Grb2, Syp, Crk, Nck and p85 and activation of various signaling cascades (; ). For instance, p85 binds to phosphotyrosines in YMXM motifs in IRS-1 and thereby activates the catalytic p110 subunit of PI 3-kinase. Thus, IGFIR and IR activate PI 3-kinase by direct interaction with p85 isoforms and via IRS-1 (; ). The second gene, p55, was identified by screening mouse expression libraries with tyrosine phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) (). Using a yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library we have identified the human homolog of p55/p55 as a binding partner of the IGFIR and IR. NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing the IGFIR (NWTc43 cells) or the IR (3006 cells) were obtained from Drs Derek LeRoith and Simeon Taylor, respectively. The antibody to the IGFIR used for immunoblotting has been described previously (; ) The LexA monoclonal antibody was purchased from Clontech. The LexA\u2013IGFIR, LexA\u2013IR and LexA\u2013IGFIR(KR) bait hybrid plasmid constructs used in this study have been previously described (; ). NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing human IGFIR (NWTc43) or human IR (3006) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, plus penicillin (50units/ml) and streptomycin (50mg/ml). The Sepharose beads that contained immobilized fusion protein or GST alone were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with cell lysates derived from NWTc43 cells (NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing human IGFIR) or C3006 cells (NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing IR). To identify proteins that bind to the IGFIR, we screened a human fetal brain cDNA library using the two-hybrid system (the interaction trap) developed by Roger Brent. The bait hybrid contained the entire coding sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of the IGFIR fused to amino acids 1\u2013202 of LexA; the human fetal brain cDNA library was fused to the B42 activation domain. Co-expression of this clone with either the LexA\u2013IGFIR or LexA\u2013IR resulted in galactose-dependent activation of both the LacZ and LEU2 reporter genes used in the interaction trap ( ). However, it did not activate the reporters when co-expressed with the kinase-negative mutant receptor [IGFIR(KR)]. These findings provided evidence that the SH2 domain(s) of hp55 interacts with the IGFIR and IR. To test the interaction between IGFIR and hp55 in vitro, we generated a GST\u2013hp55(75\u2013402) fusion protein. Lysates were prepared from quiescent and IGF-I stimulated NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing the IGFIR (NWTc43 cells). Following extensive washing the material associated with the beads was resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE and analysed by immunoblotting with an antiserum specific for the carboxy terminus of the human IGFIR. Analysis of the cell extracts (lanes 1 and 2) shows that IGFIR was autophosphorylated following activation with IGF-I. IRS-1 also bound to the GST\u2013hp55 Sepharose (lanes 5 and 6). The upper band was identified as IRS-1 by immunoblotting with an IRS-1 antibody (data not shown). A similar binding experiment was performed using IR overexpressing cell (3006) lysate for hp55 binding (data not shown). GST\u2013hp55 also binds to IR. Thus, IGFIR, IR and IRS-1 bind to hp55 in vitro and this binding requires receptor activation. Using a yeast two-hybrid system we have identified a protein that interacts with the IGFIR and IR in a kinase-dependent manner. This C-terminal splice site is between the p110 binding region and C-terminal SH2 domain and the 59amino acid segment is not required for the interaction between IGFIR and IR in the two-hybrid assay. The functional significance of N-terminal splice variants of hp55 is unknown but our two-hybrid interaction study indicates that the N-terminal domain is not necessary for an interaction of this protein with the IGFIR or IR. reported that mouse p55 formed a stable complex with p110 and it associated with IRS-1 upon insulin stimulation. Mouse p55 was identified in a screen of expression libraries with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 and p55 was found in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from CHO cells overexpressing p55; since yeasts do not contain an IRS homologue, an IRS-like molecule does not form a bridge between the IGFIR and hp55 in the yeast two-hybrid experiments. The interaction of hp55 with the IGFIR and IR provides an alternative pathway for the activation of PI 3-kinase by these two receptors.", "Previous studies revealed that miR-300 was involved in the cellular response to IR or chemotherapy drug. In this study, the expression of miR-300 was examined in lung cancer cells treated with IR, and the effects of miR-300 on DNA damage repair, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and senescence induced by IR were investigated. It was found that IR induced upregulation of endogenous miR-300, and ectopic expression of miR-300 by transfected with miR-300 mimics not only greatly enhanced the cellular DNA damage repair ability but also substantially abrogated the G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by IR. In addition, overexpression of miR-300 significantly reduced p53/apaf1 and/or IR-induced p53/apaf1 protein expression levels. Flow cytomertry analysis and colony formation assay showed that miR-300 desensitized lung cancer cells to IR by suppressing p53-dependent G2 cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and senescence. These data demonstrate that miR-300 regulates the cellular sensitivity to IR through targeting p53 and apaf1 in lung cancer cells.", "Silymarin was added to the HFHC diet, the treatment continued for additional 12 weeks and the effects on BMI, hepatomegaly, visceral fat, lipid profile, transaminases, HOMA-IR, steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, oxidative stress, and apoptosis were determined. In spite of the hypoglycemic properties of the HFHC + SIL, reversion of IR was not achieved mainly because the level of insulin were unchanged. In the table are reported the values of glycemia, insulinemia as well as de HOMA-IR after the trial.", "Therefore, mice after IR injury were treated with Red CMTPX cell tracker PBMCs pre-incubated with Tand-scFv Treatment with Tand-scFv Taken together, platelet-targeted cell therapy using Tand-scFv Alterations in secondary cell type infiltration due to treatment with Tand-scFv To support the reduction of inflammation within the ischemic myocardium cytokine staining for MCP-1, Il-1\u03b2, and TNF\u03b1 was performed 24 h after IR injury. As expected, all cytokines were upregulated after IR injury as compared to the healthy controls. Intravenous cell delivery is the least invasive and most convenient route, and leads to a uniform distribution of the cells in the infarcted area There have been various promising candidates that showed safety and potential for cardiac cell therapy in preclinical IR injury models, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), tissue-resident cardiac progenitor cells (CPC), cardiac stem cells (CSC), and embryonic stem cells (ESC), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), as well as bone marrow-derived or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) In general, the clinical use of PBMCs for transplantation is favorable because they can be easily, quickly and safely harvested from the peripheral blood and even from donors treated with antiplatelet agents Sca-1 is highly expressed not only on most PBMCs, but also on a broad variety of stem and progenitor cells, in particular on various types of promising regenerative cells including MSC Our targeted-PBMC approach differs substantially from the non-targeted PBMC approaches reported so far Most importantly, over 63% of the delivered Sca-1 It is well-established that AMI causes an inflammatory response characterized by recruitment and activation of immune cells of the innate and adaptive immune system Furthermore, the herein developed bispecific antibody Tand-scFv In conclusion, Tand-scFv C57BL/6 and UBC-GFP/B6 Two different scFvs, activated GPIIb/IIIa-targeted scFv (scFv Purified samples were analyzed using SDS gel electrophoresis (12% acrylamide, denaturing conditions).", "However, chronic IR is a key pathological feature of obesity, Type 2 diabetes and cancer cachexia, whereas a temporal IR is widely seen in fasting, pregnancy, exercise and stress. Therefore, it is important to understand when this transient IR-mechanism shifts to chronic IR-associated diseases. What factors result in the switch between the anabolic and catabolic conditions and what defect(s) in this switch is associated with chronic IR induction? Balanced The current mode of life with high fat-glucose diet, low physical activity, shift work and chronic stress is followed by increased fat storage, systemic IR and substantial elevation in serum insulin, triglyceride, FFA levels that enhances the risk of circadian disruption [ Is fat weight gain pathology or not? Although the exact role of IR under excess nutrients is unclear, IR may function as both a sensor of nutrient stores and as an instructive signal for tissues to switch from glucose to fatty acid metabolism [ Elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines can also contribute to IR by antagonizing insulin signaling, thereby inhibiting insulin-dependent glucose uptake. This is achieved by TNF blockades through genetic removal of the TNF/TNF-receptor [ Overweight and obese people get low-grade inflammation and IR, the induction of which closely correlates with increased production of insulin and FFA. The FFA derived from high-fat adipocytes has been suggested to contribute to IR by inhibiting the glucose uptake and its oxidation, glycogen synthesis and incomplete \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids [ However extreme diet-induced obesity, accompanied by systemic IR, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia, is observed as an evolutionary conserved, adaptive and entirely pathology-free response in obese hibernators [ The circadian system is regulated by the balance between energy-producing catabolic processes and energy-consuming anabolic process, and its metabolic switch from one process to another. The transition from leanness to overweight and obesity can disrupt the normal circadian rhythm, in parallel with chronic activation of catabolic programs (inflammation, lipolysis and stress), mediators of which such as inflammatory cytokines, saturated fatty acids and glucocorticoid share the common property \u2013 induction of IR supporting the circadian disorders in the adipose tissue (the effect is illustrated as a right and downward shift from the white to red color region on the U-curve). Transition to diabetes correlates with the formation of vicious cycles maintaining chronic IR and circadian disorders: as the adipocyte tissue becomes unresponsive to insulin the pancreas compensates by secreting ever more anabolic insulin, and gradually tissues grow a higher threshold of resistance to insulin action. It can be assumed that concurrent interactions between both activated catabolic and anabolic programs alter circadian glucose-lipid rhythms and support the chronic inflammatory-mediated IR state in the adipose tissue, which can form a pathological basis for development of diabetes (red color region). One of important implications of the above mentioned ana\u00adlysis is that transition of an adaptive IR to its chronic pathological state is followed by the activation of catabolic programs (as lipolysis and low-grade inflammation) under anabolic conditions, which is associated with elevated circulating insulin concentration in day and night period. In consequence of these changes, chronic IR may disrupt the circadian rhythm that promotes the development of the obesity-induced prediabetic state. For example, permanent IR supports uncontrolled lipolysis, which is one of the earlier events in systemic lipotoxicity [ Before formulating therapeutic strategies based on circadian correction, certain questions remain to be addressed. IR is nearly always considered to be \u2018harmful\u2019 and at the root of Type 2 diabetes [ Taken together, the analyzed data support the idea that the IR acts as a dual complementary adaptive mechanism for maintenance of glucose homeostasis in opposite catabolic and anabolic conditions. Under these conditions catabolic IR can protect brain tissues from hypoglycemic shock, whereas anabolic IR can protect critical tissues of cardiovascular system from hyperglycemia-induced injury. A recent review [ Viewing diabetes as a metabolic circadian disease with anabolic/catabolic imbalance, it can be proposed that certain diet and/or physical exercise can restore the healthy circadian rhythm via reduction of IR, FFA and blood glucose levels. As an example, this aim may be achieved by exercise through trained skeletal muscles, because intensive exercise increases consumption of glucose by up to 50-fold and in this way improve hyperglycemia and also counteract IR [ In recent years, the role of the circadian system in the control of glucose-lipid metabolism gained clinical interest based on epidemiological data linking lifestyles related to circadian disorders to increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes that are associated with chronic insulin resistance in day and night period.", ": The effect of 4 Gy of IR on the expression of the RAF1-ERK-IKK-NF\u03baB pathway was examined in A549 and H1299 lung cancer cell lines using Western blot analysis and confocal microscopy. : IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b3, and I\u03baB\u03b1 increased upon exposure to IR, thereby affecting nuclear levels of NF\u03baB (phospho-p65). : Exposure of lung cancer cells to IR results in NF\u03baB activation via IKK. Twenty-four hours after plating 250 A549 or H1299 cells, 75 uM of ERK or 20 uM of IKK\u03b2 inhibitors was added to the cell medium for another 24 h. The inhibitors were then removed, and the cells were treated with single irradiation doses of 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 Gy IR and incubated in fresh, inhibitor-free medium for another 7 days, when cell proliferation was evaluated with Alamar Blue\u00ae. Paired and unpaired two-tailed First, we investigated whether and how IR affects family members of the IKK-NF\u03baB complex. The A549 and H1299 lung cancer cell lines were irradiated with 4 Gy IR and analyzed using immunoblotting and confocal microscopy. The protein levels of IKK\u03b1 and its phosphorylated form pIKK\u03b1 started increasing within the first 4 h after-4 Gy irradiation of the A549 and H1299 lung cancer cells (IKK\u03b1: 1.73 fold/ IR affects protein levels of the IKK members, upstream activators, and phosphorylation of the downstream p65 NF\u03baB in A549 and H1299 lung cancer cell lines. A549 and H1299 cells were treated with 4 Gy IR, and cytoplasmic (IKK\u03b1, pIKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b3, I\u03baB\u03b1, pp65 NF\u03baB, RAF1, and pAKT1S1) or nuclear fractions (pp65 NF\u03baB) of cell lysates were collected 30 min, 4 and 24 h, and 7 days post-irradiation and analyzed with Western blot. IR affects protein levels of IKK members, upstream activators, and phosphorylation of the downstream p65 NF\u03baB in A549 and H1299 lung cancer cell lines. Investigating the possible pathways involved in signaling cascades that may converge to the activation of the NF\u03baB pathway following IR, we also examined levels of RAF1 and of an Akt1-mediated phosphorylated protein expression (Akt1 substrate 1 AKT1S1 or proline-rich Akt substrate We performed silencing of the Down-regulation of IKK family members and upstream activator Raf1 increases radiosensitivity of A549 and H1299 lung cancer cell lines. (A) Immunoblot analysis demonstrates the protein levels of pp65 NF\u03baB at 30 min after treating A549 and H1299 cells with 4 Gy IR in the presence or absence of 75 \u03bcM of the ERK inhibitor (upper panel) or 20 \u03bcM of the IKK\u03b2 inhibitor (lower panel). (B) A549 and H1299 cells were pre-treated for 24 h with 75 \u03bcM of ERK or 20 \u03bcM of IKK\u03b2 inhibitor and irradiated with 2, 4, 6 or 8 Gy IR. The inhibition of an IKK family member (IKK\u03b2) may sensitize tumor cells via both an apoptosis-dependent and apoptosis-independent manner, thus involving or bypassing NF\u03baB This study confirmed the leading role of the IKK complex in radiosensitivity by increasing the sensitizing effect of IR by the down-regulation of either IKK\u03b1 or IKK\u03b3.", "The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution at various time points after IR (30 min, 4 h and 24 h) and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min.", "This study examined the effects of WG supplementation on markers of IR, mitochondrial substrate metabolism and innate antioxidant markers in two metabolically active tissues (i.e. WG significantly reduced serum insulin (P=0\u00b7009), the insulinotropic hormone, gastric inhibitory peptide (P=0\u00b70003), and the surrogate measure of IR, homoeostatic model assessment of IR (P=0\u00b7006). Together, these results showed that WG supplementation in HFS diet, reduced IR and improved cardiac mitochondrial metabolic functions.", "Main outcomes were prevalent and incident type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and IR. Afamin was positively associated with IR assessed by HOMA-IR (\u03b2 0.110 [95% CI 0.089-0.132], P = 1.37 \u00d7 10 -23 ). This pooled analysis in >20,000 individuals showed that afamin is strongly associated with IR, prevalence, and incidence of type 2 diabetes independent of major metabolic risk factors or parameters.", "( The responsible mechanism is still not well understood, but bilirubin originated mainly by heme degradation (Berk et al., Moreover, hyperglycemia is linked with an over-expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and NFkB; Mart\u00ednez-P\u00e9rez et al., In last years, A\u03b2 was found in peripheral plasma blood (Scheuner et al., In particular, in AD RBC, have also been described physical alterations in membrane proteins (Kay et al., There is increasing attention to the vascular dysfunction as a possible cause of AD (de la Torre, Factors other than 2,3-DPG may affect the hemoglobin affinity to oxygen (Samaja et al., It has been shown that in late onset patients, RBC membrane glucose transporter protein 1 (GLUT1) and IR, as well as ATP-binding cassette transporter sub-family A member 1 (ABCA1) and ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2), have higher levels of expression (V\u00e1rady et al., In RBC with high ROS level it is easy to find higher levels of oxidized hemoglobin (metHb) that is unable to carry oxygen.", "One of the approaches in defining the changes of miRNAs in response to IR is to determine which one exhibits significant changes after IR compared with controls MiR-106b is one of the 3 highly conserved miRNAs within the miR-106b-25 cluster located in a 515-bp region at chromosome 7q22, in intron 13 of the host gene MCM7 It is worth mentioning that, in many cases, miRNAs changes reported in one study were not highlighted in another one, indicating the changes are not consistent or common. To the best of our knowledge, the changes of miRNA profile induced by IR in CaP are only limited in The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway is implicated in a diverse array of cellular functions including survival, growth, proliferation, differentiation, stem cell-like properties, metabolism and angiogenesis The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway was mediated by phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a negative regulator of Akt expression. It was reported increased miR-21 was induced after IR, facilitating the repression of PTEN and the activation of Akt to promote the DNA damage repair and cell survival in U251 glioblastoma cell line The MAPK pathway was demonstrated to be associated with growth factor-mediated regulation of cellular events such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis Similar to the PI3K/Akt pathway, the MAPK pathway has a number of miRNA regulators. Members of the MiR-17-5p is usually overexpressed and acts as an oncomiR in tumor to effectively activate the p38 MAPK pathway and elevate the phosphorylation level of heat shock protein 27 (hsp27) DDR is an essential process during IR, which can maintain genome integrity in cells by reversing the exogenous and endogenous DNA damage and is indispensable in cell survival during DNA replication Initial step after damage by IR includes DNA damage sensing and cell cycle checkpoint activation. SSB sensing is often performed by poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase-1 (PARP-1) while the sensing of DSB, the more common form of IR-induced damage, is conducted by MRN complex (MRE11/RAD50/NBS1). The p53-dependent G1/S checkpoint not only functions to permanently arrest damaged cells but also to temporarily prolong the time for repair Moreover, at G2/M checkpoint, it was reported that miR-95 overexpression recapitulated an aggressive phenotype including deregulated G2/M checkpoint following IR and increased invasive potential in PC-3 CaP and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines Failure to repair radiation-induced DNA damage triggers cell death directly or indirectly by apoptosis, mitotic catastrophe or senescence. One of the most important regulators of this pathway is the Bcl-2 family of proteins including myeloid cell leukemia1 (MCL1) and Bcl-2 itself Autophagy is a regulated and catabolic process which plays an important part in response to IR Areas of hypoxia within prostate tumors are known to be involved in radiation response EMT is characterized by the loss of adhesive features, enhanced cell motility as well as the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics, such as invasive motility In the last decade, CSC theory has offered an explanation for tumor relapse and therapeutic resistance, and CSCs are closely associated with radiosensitivity in CaP via multiple mechanisms, which has recently been reviewed The miRNAs involved in regulating radiosensitivity in CaP are summarized in It is clear that miRNAs are actively involved in tumorigenesis and treatment responses, and mounting data suggest that they may serve as promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in cancer treatment Recently, Montani In CaP, more than 40 studies performed in investigating miRNAs in whole-blood samples including serum, plasma, peripheral mononuclear cells, exosomes and urine have been published, which was recently reviewed by Fendler With the controversial PSA-based screening, overdiagnosis and overtreatment have become a major problem in the management of CaP Preliminary data from Gonzales In terms of CaP RT, the lack of effective and accurate biomarkers that predict the presence of, or the potential leading to radioresistance in patients, remains a barrier in optimizing treatment strategies. miRNAs modulated by IR in CaP miRNAs regulating radiosensitivity in CaP", "To perform receptor auto-phosphorylation assays, we used a CHO-hIR stable cell line that expresses a human insulin receptor [ To determine the chemical form of the r-hINS, we used two different LC-MS platforms to detect and sequence the peptides, one with higher sensitivity and one that provided tandem MS capabilities. With insulin binding, the IR \u03b2 subunits are autophosphorylated at the three tyrosine residues, which are necessary for further signal transduction. To monitor the biological activity of the recombinant hINS (r-hINS), we used a stable CHO-IR cell lines that express insulin receptor and measured the auto-phosphorylation of IR using ELISA assay. We found that partially purified r-hINS could activate the IR to significant levels in each of three independent experiments, compared to the commercial insulin treatment ( Peptide-based drugs now receive increased attention because of several advantageous properties, including high potency, high specificity and low toxicity. We thank Jennifer S. Trigg for excellent technical assistance and Dr. Philip D. Stahl for CHO-hIR stable cell lines. The naturally occuring isotopic distributions found in these peptides results in multiple MS peaks for each peptide with an interval of 1/ z (charge) along the Recombinant human insulin (rhINS) activates its receptor in CHO-hIR stable cell lines.", "Mice were treated with PNP\u2013sirolimus (5 mg/kg), followed 2 hours later by IR (2 Gy) daily for 5 days. At the dose of 5 mg/kg, PNP\u2013sirolimus alone showed a clear tumor growth delay comparable to that of IR treatment. Combination therapy with PNP\u2013sirolimus and IR was significantly more effective than either IR or PNP\u2013sirolimus alone ( Drug-delivery systems can improve several crucial properties of free drugs, such as solubility, stability, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and efficacy.", "We aimed to assess whether a sustained virological response (SVR) after antiviral therapy prevents the development of IR in the long term. At the baseline, IR (HOMA value > 2) was detected in 48 patients (12%), and it was associated with body weight (P = 0.03), an HCV load < 0.6 \u00d7 10(6) IU/L (P = 0.006), fibrosis staging \u2265 4 (P = 0.01), and moderate to severe steatosis (P = 0.03). IR did not influence the rates of end-of-treatment response (75% versus 69%, P = 0.4), SVR (63% versus 60%, P = 0.8), or relapse (19% versus 24%, P = 0.5). After treatment, IR developed in 49 of the 384 nondiabetic patients (14%). Although the mean baseline and posttreatment HOMA values were similar in SVR patients (1.11 \u00b1 0.8 versus 1.18 \u00b1 1.1, P = 0.25), patients experiencing treatment failure showed a significant increase in the mean HOMA value at the follow-up visit (1.20 \u00b1 0.85 versus 1.49 \u00b1 1.3, P = 0.007), and there was an increased rate of de novo IR in non-SVR patients versus SVR patients (17% versus 7%, P = 0.007). According to a logistic regression analysis, treatment failure (odds ratio = 2.81, 95% confidence interval = 1.39-5.67, P = 0.004) and a 10% body mass index increase (odds ratio = 6.42, 95% confidence interval = 1.69-24.3, P = 0.006) were significantly associated with the development of de novo IR. In nondiabetic patients with chronic HCV, the achievement of SVR with PEG-IFN and RBV prevents the development of de novo IR.", "TNF-\u03b1, secreted by hypertrophic adipocytes and adipose tissue macrophages, also inhibits IR signaling by a double mechanism of serine-phosphorylation and tyrosine-dephosphorylation of IRS-1, causing inactivation and degradation of IRS-1 and a consequent stop of IR signaling.", "VRK1 knockdown resulted in the defective formation of 53BP1 foci in response to IR both in number and size. VRK1 knockdown also prevented the activating phosphorylation of ATM, CHK2, and DNA-dependent protein kinase in response to IR.", "Cells deficient in any component of the NHEJ pathway are defective in DSB repair and are highly sensitive to IR . All IR procedures were carried out under normal atmospheric pressure and temperature conditions. Cells were treated with various peptides for 1 h and exposed to a range of IR doses (0-6 Gy). After IR, fresh peptides were added every 12 h until 48 h had elapsed, and then the medium was replaced with peptide-free medium. Cells were treated with or without peptides for 1 h, followed by fresh medium, and then exposed to IR (6 Gy). To investigate the effect of peptides on IR-induced focus formation, cells were incubated with or without the peptides for 1 h, followed by IR. After treatment with the peptides and IR, cells were washed with cold PBS 3 times and fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation at the ABCDE major cluster sites in response to IR is required for efficient end processing in DNA DSB repair . Therefore, we hypothesized that blocking the ABCDE cluster autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs might inhibit recruitment of DNA repair proteins, thereby sensitizing tumor cells to IR. As shown in , we found that the BTW1 peptide (which corresponds to Thr 2609 and Ser2612) abrogated Thr2609 phosphorylation but did not affect Thr2620 and Thr2647 phosphorylation in response to IR in RKO cells. We found that IR-induced Artemis Ser516 phosphorylation was diminished in the presence of BTW3 but not BTS (B) in RKO cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that BTW3 can inhibit DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation on the ABCDE cluster, leading to inhibition of DNA-PKcs activation in response to IR. To further study the biological effect of the BTW3 peptides on the DNA damage response, we tested the peptides\u2019 effect on IR-induced formation of \u03b3-H2AX foci at DSB sites. We examined the kinetics of \u03b3-H2AX phosphorylation foci in RKO cells after 6-Gy IR in the presence of the BTW3 or BTS peptide. Neither BTW3 nor BTS alone could induce \u03b3-H2AX focus formation in the absence of IR. We found that exposure to 6 Gy alone induced 20+ foci per cell at 30 min after IR. The number of foci decreased rapidly, and at 4 h post-IR, there were only 6 foci per cell. Similar \u03b3-H2AX foci numbers were observed in cells treated with the control peptide BTS, in which \u03b3-H2AX foci also declined rapidly and nearly disappeared after 24 h. However, in the presence of BTW3, not only did the amount of IR-induced foci increase significantly (28+ foci per cell), but also the disappearance of foci was significantly retarded. At 48 h after IR, we still observed 5+ foci per cell (A and B). Retention of \u03b3-H2AX foci in cells treated with BTW3 indicates a significant delay of IR-induced DNA damage repair. DNA-PKcs, which is activated by DNA DSBs upon IR, is a critical component of the NHEJ DNA repair pathway. Small-molecule inhibitors of DNA-PKcs kinase can increase radiosensitivity of cells to IR. Among these, wortmannin, LY294002, and NU7441 are well-characterized inhibitors of DNA-PKcs, which have been reported to retard DSB repair and enhance the cytotoxicity of IR and etoposide . More importantly, interfering with Thr2647 autophosphorylation leads to hypersensitivity to IR. In summary, we identified the DNA-PKcs inhibitory peptide BTW3, which can abrogate DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation in response to IR.", "This was also true for X10, whereas IGF-1 had a higher affinity for IR-A than IR-B. X10 and glargine both exhibited a higher relative IGF-1R than IR binding affinity, whereas detemir displayed an IGF-1R:IR binding ratio of \u22641. Ligands with high relative IGF-1R affinity also had high affinity for IR/IGF-1R hybrid receptors. In general, the relative binding affinities of the analogues were reflected in their ability to phosphorylate the IR and IGF-1R. Detailed analysis revealed that X10, in contrast to the other ligands, seemed to evoke a preferential phosphorylation of juxtamembrane and kinase domain phosphorylation sites of the IR. Sustained phosphorylation was only observed from the IR after stimulation with X10, and after stimulation with IGF-1 from the IGF-1R. Both X10 and glargine showed an increased mitogenic potency compared to human insulin in cells expressing many IGF-1Rs, whereas only X10 showed increased mitogenicity in cells expressing many IRs. Receptors were quantified using QIFIKIT (Dako, Denmark) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocols using either the murine monoclonal antibody 83\u20137 against the human IR, 24\u201331 against the human IGF-1R, or an isotype control antibody. The relative binding affinities of the study ligands for the two IR isoforms and for the IGF-1R were measured using both solubilised and membrane-associated receptor systems. The relative binding affinities of the study ligands for either solubilised human IR-A or IR-B were determined by competition binding in a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) setup as previously published The relative binding affinities of the different ligands for either the membrane-associated human IR-A or IR-B were determined by competition binding in a SPA setup. SPA for hybrid receptors: WGA- purified hybrid receptors of both isoforms of IR were used. SPA PVT anti-mouse beads (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences) were incubated with IR antibody 83\u20137 and hybrid receptors for five hours at room temperature. The SPA beads were washed twice with buffer to remove homodimer IGF-1R and any other receptors not bound to the SPA beads, and Activation of the two IR isoforms was assessed by the ability of the study ligands to phosphorylate three sites chosen from the three main regions of the IR beta unit, namely J (Juxtamembrane), K (Kinase) and C (C-peptide). The respective phosphorylation sites were (using IR-B terminology) 972 ( = 960 for IR-A), 1158 ( = 1146 for IR-A) and 1334 ( = 1322 for IR-A). BHK cells overexpressing either IR-A, IR-B or IGF-1R were seeded in 12-well plates and grown until 90\u2013100% confluence in DMEM (Gibco\u00ae, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 10% FBS, 100 \u00b5g/ml penicillin and 100 U/ml streptomycin. Subsequently, cells were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and snap-frozen by pouring liquid N Cells were grown as stated above and stimulated with ligands and lysates prepared as for IR activation. Subsequently, cells were incubated for 0\u20135\u201310\u201320\u201330\u201345\u201360 min at 37\u00b0C whereupon phosphorylations of IR or IGF-1R were measured as described above. Mitogenicity of the study ligands was measured in two cell types: human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) (obtained from Lonza, Basel, Switzerland, as cryopreserved cells at passage number 7), which express predominantly IGF-1R (\u223c21 times more IGF-1R than IR), and L6-myoblasts. The L6 muscle cells were obtained from ATCC and stably transfected with human insulin receptors to over-express human IR-A The HMECs were cultured in mammary epithelial growth medium (MEGM\u00ae) containing bovine insulin (5 \u00b5g/ml), bovine pituitary extract (50 \u00b5g/ml), hydrocortisone (0.5 \u00b5g/ml), epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml) and gentamicin/amphotericin-B. For mitogenicity experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 4\u00d710 For mitogenicity experiments, L6-hIR cells were synchronised by topoinhibition (48 hrs) and serum starvation (24 hrs) prior to stimulation with test compounds Synchronised and starved L6-hIR cells were harvested and seeded at a density of 4\u00d710 In accordance with the European Pharmacopoeia The relative binding affinities for the long-acting insulin analogues, X10 and IGF-1 are summarised in Affinities were determined by insulin competition binding in a scintillation proximity assay; data are means (\u00b1 SD) of quadruplicates (solubilised receptors) or duplicates (membrane-bound receptors). IR, insulin receptor; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1; IGF-1R, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor. Binding of human insulin, IGF-1, X10, glargine and detemir to hybrid receptors formed between IGF-1R and IR were studied ( IC50 values were determined in scintillation proximity assays for displacement of IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1. Data for phosphorylation of the three representative regions of the IR isoforms are shown in Results are presented as absorbance (arbitrary value) mean \u00b1 SE, n = 4. IR, insulin receptor; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1. Data showing the rate of decline of activation (phosphorylation) by ligand for each of the three studied regions of IR-A, IR-B and IGF-1R are presented in Results are presented as mean \u00b1 SE, n = 8. IR, insulin receptor; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1. Relative proportions of human IR and IGF-1R in each cell line or type are shown in The SABC (average number of antibodies capable of binding to each cell) was measured using either the murine monoclonal antibody 83\u20137 recognising the human IR or 24\u201331 recognising the human IGF-1R. No antibody is available that recognises the extracellular domains of the rat IGF-1R, therefore it is not possible to determine the relative number of rat IGF-1R on L6-hIR cells. In the present study we have confirmed earlier results Equilibrium binding studies have revealed that insulin detemir can displace The amount of albumin used in the different assays is determined partly by historical reasons and partly by the requirement of assays With respect to mitogenic potencies in L6-hIR and HME cells, the potencies were estimated to be 9% and 17% relative to human insulin, respectively. With HMEC, it was possible to perform the assay in total absence of albumin, whereas 0.1% serum was needed in the case of L6-hIR. The albumin content in serum is low, but resulted in a slight decrease in potency in L6-hIR cells compared to HMEC, nevertheless. No major differences between the three IR phosphorylation sites examined were seen for detemir or glargine. Potentially, this could be a unique and interesting feature with super-mitogenic insulin analogues mediating an increased mitogenic potency via the IR. It has been speculated that an increase in the mitogenic properties of an insulin analogue could alternatively (or additionally) reflect a binding preference for the shorter IR-A isoform of the IR relative to the longer IR-B isoform A methodologically challenging aspect that has not been investigated in great detail is the question of hybrid receptors formed between the IR and IGF-1R and their importance for mediating mitogenic responses. Evidence suggests that hybrid receptors bind insulin with the same affinity as IGF-1R The cell lines employed in mitogenicity testing contained different levels of IRs and IGF-1Rs ( We have previously reported that sustained signalling from the IR correlated with an increased mitogenic potency of an insulin analogue The data presented herein clearly show that insulin analogues with an increased affinity for the IGF-1R also have an increased mitogenic potency in cells expressing many IGF-1 receptors. X10, but not glargine, also displays an increased mitogenic potency in cells predominantly expressing IR. Therefore, it seems clear that glargine mediates its increased mitogenic potency through the IGF-1R and not through the IR. X10 displays an increased relative mitogenic potency in both cell types employed in this study, which predominantly express either the IR (L6-hIR cells) or the IGF-1R (HMEC); thus X10 seems to be able to evoke an increased mitogenic response through both mechanisms shown in At present, it is unknown which of the two main mechanisms, or a combination thereof (depicted in In summary, our data show that neither glargine nor detemir differ from human insulin in their relative affinities for the two IR isoforms (either in homodimer form or as hybrid receptors with IGF-1R), or in their ability to stimulate the three studied IR phosphorylation sites or in signalling kinetics; neither analogue has an increased mitogenic effect in cells that express predominantly IR. X10 displays an increase in the relative IGF-1R:IR affinity ratio as well as prolonged IR signalling kinetics and is more mitogenic than human insulin in both IR and IGF-1R-expressing cells.", "We hypothesized that IGF-II exerts distinct effects from IGF-I on neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPs) via its interaction with IR-A. The IGF-1R and the IR isoforms were differentially expressed with IR-A predominant in the medial SVZ, whereas the IGF-1R was more abundant laterally. Similarly, IR-A was more highly expressed by NSPs, whereas the IGF-1R was more highly expressed by lineage restricted cells. Knockdown of IR or IGF-1R using shRNAs supported the conclusion that the IGF-1R promotes progenitor proliferation, whereas the IR is important for self-renewal. Our data support the conclusion that IGF-II promotes the self-renewal of neural stem/progenitors via the IR. IR-A/IR-B and IGF-IR were measured using the assay developed by Rowzee et al. The ESCs were switched to serum-free media (SFM) containing 1,000 units per milliliter of ESGRO and para-amino benzoic acid (0.25 Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test or Student\u2019s Standard media for neurospheres contain micromolar insulin sufficient to activate the IGF-1R as well as the IR. The spheres were collected and examined by Western blot for active-caspase 3 ( Micromolar levels of insulin can stimulate the IGF-1R (and IGF-1R/IR hybrid receptors) that suggests that either IGF-I or IGF-II will promote the growth of NSPs in 4.4 nM insulin containing media [ To determine whether IGF-II promoted self-renewal of the NSPs, a limiting dilution analysis (LDA) was performed ( We evaluated expression of several stem cell genes, ABCg, FABP7, and Sox1, by Q-PCR using RNA isolated from spheres grown for 6 DIV in the test conditions ( To more fully assess the developmental potentials of neural precursors propagated in IGF-I versus IGF-II, NSPs were generated in medium containing either 4.4 Our data suggested that IGF-II was more potent than IGF-I due to the ability of IGF-II to sustain neurosphere number across passages, to sustain the tripotentiality of the spheres, and its ability to increase the expression of three stem cell genes, while IGF-I supplementation resulted in the lowest percent tripotentiality, low sphere-forming frequency in the LDA assay, and no change in stem cell genes. One difference between IGF-II and IGF-I that could explain this unique action of IGF-II is that IGF-II binds the IR-A with high affinity. A prediction from this hypothesis is that primitive neural precursors would express higher levels of IR versus IGF-1R as compared to other more lineage restricted cell types. To measure levels of IR-A, IR-B, and the IGF-1R, we used a Q-PCR assay recently developed for relative mRNA quantification for these receptors [ IR-A was the most highly expressed receptor in NSPs ( We also evaluated the expression of IGF-2R ( The choroid plexus produces and secretes IGF-II throughout the lifespan [ As IR-A was most abundant in comparison to either IGF-1R or IR-B in NSPs and in the SVZ, we hypothesized that IGF-II acting via the IR-A might uniquely regulate NSC self-renewal. Supporting the hypothesis that IGF-1R does not effect self-renewal, sphere number was unaffected by the addition of IMC-A12 ( To more directly assess the role of IR on neurosphere growth, we manipulated IR levels using an shRNA for the IR [ To determine whether our observations carried over to other stem cell cultures, we examined the role of micromolar insulin in murine ESC cultures. Both IGF-II and one of its receptors, IR-A, are abundant within the NSC niche in vivo. Our studies demonstrate that IGF-I and IGF-II exert distinct effects on SVZ neural precursors, with IGF-II acting via IR to maintain NSCs and IGF-I acting through IGF-1R to stimulate progenitor cell proliferation. We found that: (a) IGF system activation is necessary for neural progenitor proliferation but not survival, (b) neural progenitors express high amounts of IR-A in comparison to other cell types, (c) a gradient of IGF-II is present in the NSC niche in vivo, (d) IGF-II maintains NSC number via IR-A, (e) IGF-I via IGF-1R stimulates progenitor cell proliferation, and (f) mESCs do not require IGF system activation for maintenance or proliferation. We have shown that murine NSPs require IGF-II stimulation of IR-A for stem cell maintenance. IR-A is predominantly expressed by NSPs in comparison to more differentiated cell types. IR effects neurosphere number.", "", "IR inhibited significantly xenograft growth and was associated with increased expression of Ataxia Telengiectasia Mutated (ATM) and enhanced phosphorylation of two ATM targets, H2Ax and checkpoint kinase Chk2. We implicated AMPK in the mediation of IR-induced signal transduction through an Ataxia Telengiectasia mutated (ATM)-AMPK-p53-p21 Balb/c immune-compromised nude mice were obtained from Charles River (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). At five weeks of age, animals were injected into the right flank with 1x10 After appropriate dosimetry, conformal IR treatment (10 Gy) was delivered to xenografts with a clinical radiotherapy unit while animals were anaesthetized and housed in a Plexiglas tube equipped with High-Efficiency-Particulate-Air-(HEPA) filters. Within 15 days after IR treatment, xenografts began to show differences in growth kinetics that became statistically significant by day 25 (Figure We examined the effects of IR on the total protein levels and the activity of ATM. Eight weeks after IR treatment A549 xenografts exhibited significantly increased levels of total ATM protein (Figure In recent studies with tissue cultures of A549 cells, we observed that within 24-48 h IR stimulates expression of AMPK subunits at both the mRNA and protein level [ To examine the effects of IR treatment on cell cycle checkpoint regulators, lysates of control and IR-treated xenografts were probed with anti-p53, P-p53 (Ser15), p27 We did not detect significant differences in the total Akt levels between control and irradiated tumours (Figure Since hypoxia is known to modulate tumour IR responses and ATM activity, we examined the levels of the endothelial protein CD31, as a marker of microvasculature density, and those of HIF1\u03b1, as marker of hypoxia, in control and irradiated xenografts from both lung cancer A549 and H1299 xenografts. Figure The Akt-mTOR pathway is an established mediator of radio-resistance and novel biological inhibitors of the two kinases are shown to sensitize tumour cells to IR [ Treatment of human lung xenografts with a single fraction of IR (10 Gy) caused an expected significant inhibition of tumour growth kinetics (Figure The detection of a sustained enhancement of AMPK\u03b1 protein levels and activity in tumours long after IR is a novel finding in this study (Figure Importantly, we observed that irradiated tumours maintain significantly increased levels of total and phosphorylated p53 and of CDK inhibitors p21 IR is known to mediate a rapid activation of Akt [ Our observation of sustained ATM activity in irradiated tumours is a significant finding of the present study. Since ATM is suggested to be a common regulator of the activity of the AMPK-p53/p21 This study explored in tumours the long-term regulation by IR of two key tumour suppression or growth pathways that are targets of promising therapeutics. Despite established acute activation of both the AMPK and Akt-mTOR pathways by IR, irradiated tumours showed a sustained expression and activation of the AMPK-p53/p21 The authors declare no competing interests.", "IR was calculated using homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). On multivariable analysis, PCOS cases were 3.2 times more likely to have low adiponectin level (OR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.49-6.90, p-value 0.003) compared to the controls after adjustment for age, BMI, family history, marital status, total cholesterol, HDL level and IR. The associations of IR and family history with low adiponectin level also remained statistically significant after adjustments for covariates. Serum adiponectin levels are independently associated with PCOS and are only partly explained by IR. Furthermore, its typical features like a combination of obesity, hirsutism, acne, alopecia, and irregular menstruation [ Although low adiponectin levels have been associated with PCOS which is mainly attributed to obesity among these patients, studies have also suggested that low adiponectin in PCOS may be related to IR in these women. In these women, it is not certain that to what extent, the IR determines the levels of adiponectin. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (IRB), Dow University of Health Sciences. Age, marital status, family history of PCOS, BMI, IR, total blood cholesterol level and HDL were used as covariates. IR was calculated using HOMA-IR [ Data were analyzed using the STATA Software Version 12 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). PCOS cases were 3.2 times more likely to have low adiponectin level (OR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.49-6.90, p-value 0.003) compared to controls after adjustment for age, BMI, family history, marital status, total cholesterol level, HDL and IR. The associations of IR and family history with low adiponectin level also remained statistically significant after adjustments for covariates (Table A stratified analysis was also carried out based on age categories (\u226425 years and >25 years) to assess the association of low adiponectin with PCOS. The association of PCOS with low adiponectin level remained consistent and statistically significant after adjustment for age, BMI, family history of PCOS, marital status, total cholesterol level, HDL and IR. Furthermore, family histories of PCOS and IR were also significantly associated with lower adiponectin levels. A possible explanation for this finding is that lower adiponectin levels in PCOS women might be a result of increasing IR in these patients [ We have also found an association of family history of PCOS and IR with lower adiponectin levels in PCOS women. As we included lean women with PCOS, which is also a common presentation in clinics in Pakistan, our data suggest that lower adiponectin levels in women with PCOS are not only caused by the IR and obesity in these women. On the contrary, it might be interplay of family history of PCOS and IR, or these women have inherent low levels of adiponectin regardless of their BMI and degree of IR, which leads to development of the full-blown PCOS. Longitudinal studies are therefore warranted to understand the initiating point in development of PCOS in females having a family history of PCOS and IR. In addition, we calculated IR using HOMA-IR and not by the euglycemic/hyperglycemic clamp which is the gold standard to measure IR. However, HOMA-IR is a worldwide accepted surrogate marker for the calculation of IR. But in our study, we observed a statistically significant association both for IR and adiponectin with PCOS, which is unlikely due to a misclassification bias. In conclusion, serum adiponectin levels in lean women with PCOS are only partly explained by IR.", "The aim of this study is to test whether serum levels of AIM and adipocytokines are associated with histological features, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), or whole body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI) in CHC patients. In 39 patients without overt diabetes mellitus, a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and HOMA-IR and WBISI were calculated. Adipose tissue\u2013derived cytokines, so-called adipocytokines, theoretically play an important role in the development of IR [ In this study, we analyzed the association between serum levels of AIM, leptin, adiponectin, and resistin, and clarified the clinical significance of serum AIM levels in patients with CHC. In addition, we determined whether serum levels of AIM and adipocytokines are associated with IR or sensitivity in patients with CHC. IR was calculated by the homeostasis model (homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance, HOMA-IR) using the following formula: HOMA-IR = fasting insulin (\u03bcU/ml) \u00d7 plasma glucose (mg/dl)/405.

Serum levels of AIM tended to be correlated with HOMA-IR, but this association did not show statistical significance (Figure HCV infection is the most important cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and HCC. In addition, IR and obesity are thought to be associated with histopathology of the liver. Several adipocytokines and macrophage-derived molecules are reported to be associated with IR and obesity; we examined the association between these molecules and histopathological features in the liver. In contrast, serum levels of adiponectin, leptin and resistin were associated with IR, but AIM was not. previously reported that serum levels of the AIM protein were elevated in hepatitis C patients with liver cirrhosis compared to healthy controls, using a proteomics method based on 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) [ AIM is a member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich superfamily that was initially identified as an inhibitor of apoptosis that supports the survival of macrophages against different types of pro-apoptotic stimuli [ IR is independently associated with the severity of fibrosis in chronic liver disease, including CHC and NASH [ In this study, serum levels of leptin were associated with HOMA-IR and hepatic steatosis, but not hepatic fibrosis and inflammation. Previous studies similarly showed that serum leptin levels are associated with IR [ There are several limitations to this study. In contrast, serum levels of AIM may not be correlated with IR as assessed by HOMA-IR, but adipocytokines were associated with IR and insulin sensitivity, and serum levels of leptin were associated with hepatic steatosis.", "Studies in the DU145 prostate carcinoma xenograft mouse models demonstrate the effect of combining HDIs with IR (). For example, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) increases IR-induced apoptosis in osteosarcoma cell lines but not in the rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines (). Long-term exposure to FIR induces radioresistance in several tumor cell lines, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) (). Although HDIs are known to enhance the radiosensitivity of intrinsic radioresistant cancer cell lines, not much is known on the effects of HDIs on IR induced acquired radioresistant cancer cells or the mechanisms by which HDIs enhance IR-induced cytotoxicity in these cells. Our results demonstrate that the HDIs: TSA and NaB sensitize acquired radioresistant KYSE-150R cells and promote IR-induced cell death by decreasing Bmi-1 expression. KYSE-150R cells were exposed to 5Gy IR and harvested at 1 and 24h after irradiation. The KYSE-150R radioresistant cell line was derived from KYSE-150 exposed to FIR for 6 weeks (total dose of 21Gy). We determined the effects of HDIs on the KYSE-150R cell cycle distribution as a single agent and in combination with 5Gy of IR. Moreover, an accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase was observed for KYSE-150R cells (18.6%) after 24h of 5Gy of IR (A and B). IR-induced G2/M arrest was enhanced by 47.1 and 66.2% when the cells were pretreated with TSA (0.5 and 1\u03bcM). Similarly, NaB treatment alone (5 and 10mM) induced G2/M arrest and NaB pretreatment followed by 5Gy of IR greatly enhanced the accumulation cells in the G2/M phase (B). While IR alone significantly induced G2/M arrest (50.8%) in KYSE-150 cells, this only increased to 60% with HDIs pretreatment (C). These results indicate that HDIs potentiate IR-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in radioresistant KYSE-150R cells to greater levels than in radiosensitive KYSE-150 cells. p21 expression was almost undetectable in KYSE-150R cells, but was increased by the HDI and the 5Gy IR treatments (D). Accordingly, HDI pretreatment followed by IR significantly enhanced the p21 levels of the KYSE-150R cells. To examine the effects of HDIs on IR-induced cell apoptosis, we evaluated the changes in the number of apoptotic cells. KYSE-150R cells were resistant to IR-induced apoptosis (3.1 to 5.6% after 5Gy of IR). The TSA treatments (0.5 and 1\u03bcM) increased the number of apoptotic cells (8.6 and 10.4%, respectively) (A), whereas the combination treatments with IR (5Gy) further increased the number of apoptotic cells to 14.5 and 21.4%, respectively. The KYSE-150 cells were sensitive to IR-induced apoptosis, and the apoptotic cells markedly increased from 2.8 to 12.9% after IR (B). Although HDI alone increased the number of apoptotic cells, HDI did not enhance IR-induced apoptosis in KYSE-150 cells. The red/green ratio in KYSE-150R cells was decreased by the 1\u03bcM TSA treatment or the 10mM NaB treatment, and was further decreased by HDI pretreatment followed by IR, which indicates greater mitochondrial potential collapse (C). Quantitative measurements showed that KYSE-150R cells treated with 5Gy of IR had no obvious change in MMP expression compared with the control. However, HDI pretreatment and IR induced a more significant reduction in MMP (D). Given that IR elicits genotoxic stress by triggering ROS production, we investigated the effects of HDIs on ROS generation in KYSE-150R cells. Exposure to 5Gy of IR slightly increased intracellular ROS production in KYSE-150R cells. KYSE-150R cells were exposed to 5Gy of IR after HDI pretreatment and stained at 1 and 24h after irradiation to identify the \u03b3-H2AX foci, which colocalized with DSB (C). Irradiation at 5Gy notably increased during \u03b3-H2AX foci formation in KYSE-150R cells at 1h after IR. However, such a formation diminished at 24h after IR. The HDI-pretreated KYSE-150R cells maintained a high level of \u03b3-H2AX foci formation even at 24h after IR (C). IR-induced comet tails was almost diminished at 24h after IR in control cells, while the HDI-pretreated cell maintained long comet tails, indicating that they contained more DSBs. We examined the effect of HDIs treatment on the expression of the proteins involved in the repair of IR-induced DSBs. These results suggest that HDIs enhance IR-induced DNA damage and delay DNA repair in KYSE-150R cells. Bmi-1 knockdown increased the apoptotic cell numbers both in untreated cells and cells post-IR. Pretreatment with HDIs did not increase IR-induced apoptosis (D). Our results show that HDIs enhance IR-induced G2/M arrest in KYSE-150R cells, but had little effect on KYSE-150 cells. Interestingly, the HDIs selectively increased IR-induced apoptosis in KYSE-150R cells and promoted the dissipation of MMP, which correlate with increased apoptosis. Moreover, HDIs enhanced IR-induced ROS generation and DNA damage, as well as delayed DNA repair in KYSE-150R cells. IR induces clustered DNA lesions, especially complex DSB and some types of non-DSB clusters (). Thus, the significant inhibition of Bmi-1 expression in KYSE-150R cells by HDIs indicates the potential of HDIs in enhancing IR-induced apoptosis. HDIs increase p21 expression and enhance IR-induced G2/M arrest by inhibiting Bmi-1 expression. In addition, HDIs induce mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS generation, which affects the ability to repair IR-induced DNA damage, ultimately increasing IR-induced cell death. Thus, combining HDIs with IR may be less toxic and more effective therapy for acquired radioresistant cancers.", "After applying IR after foot shock, we found that IR abolished the effect of DMS on alleviation of depressive behaviors (Figure Furthermore, mood disorder induced by acute stress impairs long-term potentiation (LTP) in the neural circuitry of hippocampus [ Finally we would like to further examine whether DMS could alleviate the anxiety-related behaviors in other disease models.

But the WC is strongly associated with HOMA-IR. While OWC is very likely a good measure to exclude non-IR subjects in our study, determination of optimal WC to identify elderly IR subjects warrants further study in a larger sample of the general population. 94 subjects (42 men and 52 women) were included in the study (Table General characteristic of participants The ROC curve analysis was conducted for the components of metabolic syndrome on the criterion of HOMA-IR which was categorized based on first quartile and three other quartiles. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and proportion correctly classified (PCC) for IR (Table Predictive value of insulin resistance using optimal waist circumference, NCEP and IDF definition of MS In univariable and multivariable logistic regression, there was only an association between WC and TG between the components of MetS. The high sensitivity of OWC (0.80) among the male elderly indicates the proportion of IR which was correctly diagnosed and its high specificity (0.84) means the proportion of correctly identified non-IR. Waist circumference is a central measure to describe the metabolic syndrome as defined by NCEP: ATP-III and IDF definition [ On the other hand the correlation of abdominal obesity with insulin resistance is to the extent that more laborious measures of insulin resistance seem unnecessary [ The WC cutoff point has been determined for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in Iranian adult population [ In the current study, OWC had the ability to discriminate among IR and non-IR males. Due to the cross sectional nature of this study, we were unable to estimate relative risk of being IR for those above and below the optimal WC cutoff. The fasting blood sugar measure is required to identify IR in elderly Iranian women. In elderly Iranian men, WC seems to perform as well as IDF criteria at predicting IR. We suggest further studies be carried out with larger samples of elderly subjects to determine optimal WC cutoff in elderly IR subjects.", "Publications have positively linked the advancement of IR with hepatic steatosis, abdominal obesity, and chronic subclinical inflammation [ The graded serum levels of acute phase reactants (e.g. S100A9 Development of CVD is the principal complication in T2DM but it can precede its development as well [ IR is a leading factor in T2DM and is the central component of metabolic syndrome [ Blood transfusions can be considered the first primitive form of cell therapy.", "In response to IR exposure, certain cell types appear to be programmed to favor cell cycle arrest and DNA repair over apoptosis (e.g. T cells) The DSB-DNA damage response (DSB-DDR) pathway involves the transcriptional and post-translational regulation of hundreds of genes IR-mediated apoptosis occurs through engagement of the intrinsic, mitochondrial pathway. Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins are critical mediators of mitochondrial apoptosis BH3-only proteins can be classified as either activators or sensitizers, based on the mechanism by which they cause activation of Bax and Bak The p53 transcriptional targets Overexpression of Here we investigate the mechanisms by which Bad sensitizes zebrafish neural tissue to IR. Surprisingly, we show that similar to Puma, endogenous Bad is essential for robust IR-induced apoptosis. These non-redundant functions for Bad and Puma suggest a model whereby Puma acts as an essential activator BH3-only protein that requires the sensitizer BH3-only protein Bad to promote IR-induced mitochondrial apoptosis. Zebrafish were maintained and bred as described IR was administered with either a Cs-137 gamma irradiator (Gammacell 1000) or an X-ray irradiator (RadSource RS2000). For analysis of the We previously showed that overexpression of zebrafish Bad sensitizes zebrafish neural tissue to IR-induced apoptosis To determine whether endogenous Bad normally promotes IR-induced apoptosis in this model system, we generated both a translation-blocking ( (A) Shown are lateral views of 27-hpf embryos (head is top left in each panel) either uninjected or injected with 200 nmol of The tumor suppressor p53 is a critical component of the DSB-DDR pathway (A) Shown are lateral views of representative tails from 27-hpf wild-type or We next questioned whether p53 is required for the activation of Bad by an IR-independent stimulus. To establish an IR-independent stimulus of Bad in zebrafish embryos, we took advantage of the previous finding that Akt can inhibit the pro-apoptotic function of Bad by phosphorylating Serine 136 on human BAD Since we established wortmannin treatment as an IR-independent stimulus of Bad\u2019s pro-apoptotic activity, we next asked whether p53 is required for the synergy between wortmannin and Bad. Thus, we sought to further understand why p53 is specifically required for Bad to induce apoptosis in response to IR. IR-induced apoptosis represents a delayed response to DNA damage since it requires time for p53-mediated transcription and translation of pro-apoptotic targets like Bad is well-known to promote apoptosis through its function as a BH3-only protein. However, one simple explanation for the ability of Bad to augment IR-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner is by increasing the activity of p53. To therefore determine whether Bad is causing an increase in p53 transcriptional activity, we tested the induction of the p53 transcriptional targets p53 transcriptional activity was analyzed in embryos injected with 50 The p53 transcriptional target (A) Shown are lateral views of representative tails from 27-hpf embryos exposed to 8 Gy IR after injection at the one-cell stage with 50 pg of mRNA encoding BAD\u2019s pro-apoptotic function has been defined by its ability to bind and inactivate the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL to induce mitochondrial apoptosis (A) Shown are lateral views of 27-hpf wild-type embryos (head is top left in each panel) injected with either 1) 50 pg of Our data led us to devise a model ( IR activates the pro-apoptotic activity of Bad in a pathway that is either downstream of or parallel to p53 (dotted lines indicate that it is unclear whether this step occurs in a p53-dependent or \u2013independent manner). Bad and Puma are dependent upon each other to promote IR-induced apoptosis. However, based on Bad\u2019s established role as a sensitizer BH3-only protein and Puma\u2019s reported role as an activator BH3-only protein, Bad likely functions upstream of Puma to induce IR-mediated apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. Bad-mediated radiosensitization does not alter the timing of IR-induced apoptosis.", "To determine the prevalence of nutritional status, MS and IR, and secondly, to study the associations among them. Abnormal Homeostasis model assessment index (HOMA-IR) was based on a national standard. The prevalence of obesity, MS and IR was 16.1%, 7.3% and 25.9%, respectively. The prevalence of IR and MS was higher in obese children. MS and IR were strongly associated with an OR of 8.0 (95% CI= 5.9-10.7). Multivariate analysis showed that all MS components were associated to IR. The strong positive association between nutritional status, IR and MS points out the need to early identify risk factors for NCDs allowing for prevention.", "In the present study, we investigated the relationship between RAD18 and resistance to IR and examined the expression levels of RAD18 in primary and recurrent GBM samples. In brief, cells were treated with different doses of IR. We speculate that RAD18 might play a part in acquired IR resistance in glioma cells. The clonogenic analysis showed that the overexpression of RAD18 rendered A172 cells more resistant to IR treatment (C and ). Depletion of RAD18 by shRNAs in two glioma cells sensitized their response to IR treatment as demonstrated by reduced colony-forming ability (<0.01, E and F). Taken together, these results suggest that overexpression of RAD18 confers resistance to IR treatment in glioma cells. To determine the mechanisms by which RAD18 enhances the resistance of glioma cells to IR, we analyzed the effect of RAD18 overexpression on IR-induced apoptosis. A172 cells stably expressing RAD18 were exposed to 2Gy IR for 15min, and then apoptosis was determined by the Annexin V/PI flow cytometric assay after 48h. The results showed that A172 cells with stable RAD18 expression exhibited a significantly reduced level of IR-induced apoptosis compared to the control cells, leading to a reduction from 67.51% to 10.63% (<0.05, A). As shown in B, the expression of cleaved caspase-3 was increased in A172 cells, and significantly decreased after forced overexpression of RAD18 in response to IR. In contrast, the RAD18-depleted U87 and U251 glioma cells showed a marked increase in IR-induced apoptosis compared to the control cells (<0.01, C). An increase in the amount of cleaved caspase-3 was also consistently observed in RAD18-depleted U87 and U251 cells compared to the control cells in response to IR (D). These data suggest that RAD18 overexpression confers resistance to IR-mediated apoptosis in glioma cells. We next investigated if RAD18 depletion-induced hypersensitivity to IR was attributed to impaired DSB repair. Depletion of RAD18 resulted in an increase in cells containing >10 \u03b3-H2AX foci compared with control cells in the absence or presence of IR (<0.01, B). To confirm these results, Western blotting analysis was performed to compare the relative levels of \u03b3-H2AX after IR. We consistently found that \u03b3-H2AX levels were significantly increased in RAD18-depleted cells in response to 2Gy of IR at the 24-h time point (C). To determine whether the association of RAD18 expression with IR resistance is clinically relevant, we examined the expression levels of RAD18 in a cohort of 40 GBMs and 10 NBTs using qRT-PCR assays. Furthermore, we examined the mRNA expression of RAD18 in tumor tissues from patients who received IR treatment. Histological analysis and qRT-PCR data showed that RAD18 expression was dramatically elevated in the recurrent tumors compared to the primary tumors after IR treatment (<0.01, B and C), indicating that the glioma cells with high expression of RAD18 were more resistant to the IR and more susceptible to death, whereas the glioma cells with low RAD18 levels were more sensitive to IR. Together, these results suggest that RAD18 is of clinical significance as a mediator of IR resistance. IR is a key component of standard therapy for GBM patients. However, acquired resistance limits the therapeutic efficacy of IR . Therefore, the identification of targets responsible for IR resistance is critical for successful GBM treatment. In this study, we show, for the first time, that RAD18 functions as a novel mediator of IR resistance in glioma cells. However, whether RAD18 can modulate resistance to IR in gliomas is unknown. To explore the relationship between dysregulation of RAD18 and IR resistance in glioma cells, we first examined the level of RAD18 expression in several glioma cell lines and their responses to IR. Our data showed that the levels of RAD18 in glioma cells correlate with their resistance to IR. We have also shown that ectopic expression of RAD18 conferred the ability to acquire IR resistance. Conversely, depletion of endogenous RAD18 sensitized glioma cells to IR. In addition, we further explored the possible mechanisms involved in the RAD18-mediated resistance to IR by assessing the effect of RAD18 overexpression or knockdown on IR-induced apoptosis. Our data indicated that overexpression of RAD18 in RAD18-low A172 cells significantly inhibited IR-induced apoptosis, whereas depletion of RAD18 in RAD18-high glioma cells resulted in a marked increase in IR-induced apoptosis, indicating that RAD18 may regulate IR resistance by regulating the effects of IR on apoptosis in glioma cells. Furthermore, we showed that RAD18 is involved in HR-mediated repair and that knockdown of RAD18 led to the disruption of HR-mediated repair and to the accumulation of IR-induced genomic damage. More importantly, we found that elevated expression of RAD18 is associated with recurrent GBM patients who underwent IR therapy. To the best of our knowledge, the present study provides the first evidence that RAD18 may function as an important regulator during the process of IR-induced DNA damage and may play a critical role in GBM radioresistance. In summary, our findings reveal that RAD18 may serve as an important mediator of the response of glioma cells to IR.", "Cell growth was inhibited by IR in a dose-dependent manner and ADI enhanced the radiosensitivity. ASS was unchanged by ADI plus IR, but p21 (a CDK inhibitor) was upregulated and c-Myc downregulated.", "The present study examined the role of lymphocytes in adipose tissue inflammation and IR. In a mouse model of obesity-mediated IR, high-fat diet (HFD) induced IR already after 5 weeks, which was associated with a marked T-lymphocyte infiltration in visceral adipose tissue. In contrast, recruitment of macrophages was delayed with an increase of MAC3-positive staining and F4/80 mRNA expression after 10 weeks of HFD, suggesting a dissociation of macrophage invasion into adipose tissue and IR initiation. In patients with type 2 diabetes, lymphocyte content in adipose tissue biopsies significantly correlated with waist circumference, a marker of IR. Proinflammatory T-lymphocytes are present in visceral adipose tissue and may contribute to local inflammatory cell activation before the appearance of macrophages, suggesting that these cells could play an important role in the initiation and perpetuation of adipose tissue inflammation as well as the development of IR.", "We hypothesized that an exercise-induced increase in MnSOD would provide cardioprotection by attenuating IR-induced oxidative modification to critical Ca(2+)-handling proteins, thereby decreasing calpain-mediated cleavage of these and other proteins attenuating cardiomyocyte death. After IR, myocardial apoptosis and infarct size were significantly reduced in hearts of exercised animals compared with sedentary controls. In addition, exercise prevented IR-induced calpain activation as well as the oxidative modification and calpain-mediated degradation of myocardial Ca(2+)-handling proteins (L-type Ca(2+) channels, phospholamban, and sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase). Further, IR-induced activation of proapoptotic proteins was attenuated in exercised animals. These results suggest that MnSOD provides cardioprotection by attenuating IR-induced oxidation and calpain-mediated degradation of myocardial Ca(2+)-handling proteins, thereby preventing myocardial apoptosis and necrosis.", "We tested the hypotheses that cytokines associated with adiposity are also correlated with IR in early adolescents and that these relationships are moderated by weight status, levels of vigorous physical activity (VPA), or maximal aerobic power (pVO2max). Glucose, insulin, adiponectin, resistin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 were measured; and IR index was based on the Homeostatic Model Assessment. Adiponectin, resistin, and TNF-alpha were associated with IR in all adolescents (R2=0.329, P<.001; R2=0.152, P=.001; and R2=0.141, P=.002; respectively); but interleukin-6 was not (R2=0.148, P=.114). The degree of association between adiponectin and IR was stronger in overweight than in normal-weight adolescents (P<.050). When regression models included weight status, neither TNF-alpha nor resistin was significantly related to IR (P>.050). Exercise did not moderate the association between these cytokines and IR. Increased adiposity, resulting in reduced adiponectin and increased resistin and TNF-alpha, may link these cytokines with IR in adolescents.", "IGF-II exerts its physiological effects essentially through the IGF-I receptor and the IR-A isoform . Hence, the high-affinity interaction of the IR-A with IGF-II, but not IGF-I, is important for normal foetal cell growth . In tumours producing IGF-II, IR-A plays a significant role in growth promotion and apoptosis protection . To extend our systematic sequencing approach to the murine class II tyrosine kinase receptor, we defined a pair of primers related to cytoplasmic domain of the IGF-I receptor, IR and IRR. In some instances IR can bind IGF-II with unusually high affinity, such atypical IR have been found in IM-9 lymphoblasts cells, in immature erythrocytes and in foetal tissues . Genetical analysis using transgenic mice has also revealed that the growth-promoting effect of IGF-II in mouse embryos is partly through interaction with IR . Vigneri and coworkers demonstrated that the human IR isoform A is a physiological receptor for IGF-II and that IGF-II binding to the IR isoform A is implicated in the foetal development and cancer biology . Sequence comparison of IR cDNA sequences from human, mouse and rat species, indicates that mouse IR receptor does not include the 36 additional nucleotides encoding 12 amino-acids at the carboxyl terminus of the receptor \u03b1-subunit human IR isoform A (Exon11). To date only one type of IR was detected in mouse and it corresponds to the isoform B found in rat and human IR. Furthermore, contrary to C2per cells, we were not able to detect IR expression in C2ind cells.", "c-Jun N-terminal kinase, inhibitor of kappa kinase beta and inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB phosphorylation and total protein expression, as well as Ser307-IRS-1 phosphorylation, were not altered by lipid infusion compared with GLYC infusion. These data indicate that acute, physiological elevation in FFA has a greater impact on insulin signalling downstream of IR and IRS-1, at the level of PKB and GSK-3beta, and that under these conditions stress signalling pathways are not significantly stimulated.", "bax overexpression in MCF-7 cells by stable transfection does not affect viability by itself, but each stable transfectant was more sensitive to IR than the parental MCF-7 cells. IR upregulated p53 and p21WAF1 about 5- to 10-fold and downregulated bcl-2 and bcl-XL by 80-90% at 6 hr in both parent and bax stably transfected MCF-7 cells to the same degree.", "Our results show that IFN-gamma treatment alone or together with TNF-alpha, can alter the insulin binding to K562 cells without changing the expression or affinity of the IR. These results support the findings that MHC-I molecules associate and interact with the IR at the cell surface.", "In rat lungs after IR, the coefficient of lung endothelial permeability (Kfc) increased by 112 +/- 12% in controls and by 27 +/- 8% (p < 0.001) in PTX-treated lungs. After IR, lung myeloperoxidase and blood neutrophil count decrease were lower with PTX than in controls, and the changes in Kfc were correlated with the percentage decrease in blood neutrophils during reperfusion. In conclusion, PTX prevented IR lung endothelium injury and improved post-IR lung function by decreasing neutrophil lung sequestration, and this agent might be useful in clinical lung transplantation.", "Caveolin binds to IR and stimulates signalling. We report that, in liver-derived cells lacking caveolae, autophosphorylation of the endogenous IR is dependent on raft lipids, being compromised by acute cyclodextrin-mediated cholesterol depletion or by antibody clustering of glycosphingolipids. Moreover, we provide evidence that IR becomes recruited to detergent-resistant domains upon ligand binding and that clustering of GM2 ganglioside inhibits IR signalling apparently by excluding the ligand-bound IR from these domains. Rather, the dynamic recruitment of the ligand-bound IR into rafts may serve to regulate interactions in the initiation of the IR signalling cascade.", "Here we show that Grb14 inhibits in vitro IR substrate phosphorylation. Grb14 does not alter the K(m) for ATP and behaves as an uncompetitive inhibitor for the IR substrate. Similar experiments performed with other members of the Grb7 family, Grb7 and Grb10, and with IGF-1 receptor argue in favor of a specific inhibition of the IR catalytic activity by Grb14. The IR-interacting domain of Grb14, the PIR, is sufficient for the inhibitory effect of Grb14, whereas the SH2 domain has no effect on IR catalytic activity. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing both IR and Grb14, Grb14 binds to the IR as early as 1 min after insulin stimulation, and the two proteins remain associated. When interacting with Grb14, the IR is protected against tyrosine phosphatases action and therefore maintained under a phosphorylated state. However, the binding of Grb14 to the IR induces an early delay in the activation of Akt and ERK1/2 in CHO-IR cells, and ERK1/2 are less efficiently phosphorylated. These findings show that Grb14 is a direct inhibitor of the IR catalytic activity and could be considered as a modulator of insulin signaling.", "Plasma AST and ALT levels were 40- and 24-fold higher respectively for the obese animals after IR compared with their preischemic values, whereas the corresponding increase were 4.2- and 3.4-fold for the lean animals, respectively. IR led to significantly greater hepatic injury in the steatotic than in the normal liver. In conclusion, the increased sensitivity of the steatotic liver to IR injury would appear to involve both alterations in blood flow in the microcirculation and to cellular changes.", "The cell growth inhibition in DU145 (p53-mutated) cells by IR was strongly enhanced by additional Ad5CMV-p53 infection in a viral dose-dependent manner. In DU145 cells, IR alone induced minimal p53 mRNA expression. However, IR combined with Ad5CMV-p53 infection stimulated significant increase in p53 mRNA expression supplemented with Bax and p21 mRNA expressions. In PC-3 (p53-null), IR induced Bax and p21 mRNA expression, while the combination effects were observed in p53, Bax, and p21 mRNA expression. Apoptotic cell deaths were rarely observed after IR alone (DU145: 3%, PC-3: 5%). In this study, we demonstrated that the combination of IR and Ad5CMV-p53 gene therapy resulted in remarkable synergistic effects in human prostate cancer cells.", "Elevated IR protein level was further confirmed in an independently scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cell line N1E-115 (ScN1E-115). Proliferation studies showed that the increased IR level in ScN2a did not result in an increased insulin-mediated cell growth compared to normal N2a cells. Binding studies indicated that this apparent paradox was due to a 65% decrease in specific [(125)I]insulin binding sites in ScN2a when compared to the amount of immunoreactive IR, although the IR binding affinity was unchanged. Analysis of insulin stimulated IR tyrosine phosphorylation showed a slight but not significant reduction in ScN2a, when related to the increased level of immunoreactive IR. However, comparing the IR tyrosine phosphorylation to the loss of binding sites in ScN2a, we demonstrated an increased IR tyrosine phosphorylation of the remaining functional IR. In addition to these differences in IR properties, the basal extracellular signal regulated kinase-2 (ERK2) phosphorylation detected by Western blot, was significantly elevated and the insulin stimulated ERK2 phosphorylation was subsequently decreased in ScN2a. Together, these data show that scrapie infection affects the level and processing of the IR and signal transduction mediated by the IR in neuroblastoma cells, as well as induces an elevated basal ERK2 phosphorylation.", "These observations rule out ATR and implicate both ATM and DNA-PK in RPA2 phosphorylation after exposure to IR. UCN-01, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, Chk1, and cyclin-dependent kinases, has no effect on IR-induced RPA2 phosphorylation.", "This evidence is based, in part, on the observation that the addition of exogenous PGs to immortalized cultured cells can serve either to protect or to sensitize these cells to IR, with the protective or sensitive response depending on the PG that is used . Several groups have published extensively on the role of PGs in the cellular and cytotoxic response to IR ; the mechanistic pathway, however, is less clearly understood . It has been shown that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as ibuprofen and indomethacin, inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) activity and sensitize tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of IR, suggesting a role for COX activity in the cellular response to IR . Resveratrol is a natural compound that has been shown to inhibit COX-1 activity, and as such, it seemed logical to determine if resveratrol would also alter how tumor cells respond to the cytotoxicity of IR. Pretreatment with resveratrol enhanced tumor cell killing by IR in HeLa and SiHa tumor cells. The results of these experiments suggest that resveratrol alters the cellular response to IR and also inhibits cell cycle progression. Cells were exposed to doses of IR, ranging from 2 to 8 Gy, using a General Electric Maxitron 250 kV X-ray machine that contains an exposure chamber supporting a 37\u00b0C, 5% CO atmosphere. Following IR exposure, cells were returned to a 37\u00b0C incubator. After attaining sufficient growth, the cells were pretreated with resveratrol (10 or 25 \u03bcM) for 4 h, incubated at 37\u00b0C for predesignated time periods, and exposed to IR at doses of 2, 4, 6, or 8 Gy . Survival curves are shown plotted as log / (where is the total number of cells plated per 60-mm dish multiplied by the plating efficiency) as a function of the dose of IR (Gy) and curves were plotted and visually fitted as described . In order to assess the effects of COX activity on the cellular response to IR, the basal expression of immunoreactive COX protein levels was initially established in multiple human cervical carcinoma cell lines. With this perspective in mind, the cell biological effects of resveratrol on HeLa and SiHa cell survival after exposure to IR were investigated. HeLa and SiHa cells were treated with 10 or 25 \u03bcM of resveratrol and returned to a 37\u00b0C incubator for 4 h, after which the cells were exposed to 2, 4, 6, or 8 Gy of IR. When plotted as a function of the IR dose, a dose-dependent increase in sensitization of HeLa (, left panel) and SiHa (right panel) cells to IR following pretreatment with resveratrol can be observed. The results of these experiments indicate that pretreatment with resveratrol results in greater susceptibility of these tumor cells to IR-induced cytotoxicity. To further investigate the role of resveratrol in the cellular response to IR, the effect of resveratrol on cell growth and cell cycle progression of HeLa cells was addressed. First, it has been clearly established that the cytotoxicity induced by IR varies widely through the different phases of the cell cycle . The results presented here suggest that resveratrol, a polyphenol found in the skin of grapes, acts as an agent that induces both an early S phase cell cycle check point and an increase in cellular sensitivity to the cytotoxicity of IR. The results of the experiments overviewed in this manuscript are consistent with the observations that PGs alter the cellular and cytotoxic response to IR . The role of COX in the cellular and cytotoxic response to IR appears to be a complicated one, and its effect as a radioprotector and/or radiosensitizing agent may depend on multiple cellular, genetic, and epigenetic factors, as well as other intracellular alterations. While this work clearly shows that resveratrol alters how tumor cells respond to IR and inhibits cell cycle progression in two cervical tumor cell lines, the specific mechanism is unclear.", "Also, they can arise due to endogenous processes such as the production of reactive oxygen intermediates or the collapse of stalled DNA replication forks [ In the following section we will focus on the response to IR-induced DNA DSBs, since these are lesions that dividing cells must deal with prior to mitotic entry to avoid uneven division of the genome. In line with this, IR-induced DNA lesions lead to strong activation of the G2/M checkpoint. Subsequently, the 14-3-3 protein sequesters CDC25C away from its substrates, notably CDK1 [ A further layer of control of CDC25A degradation following IR is achieved by the kinase NEK11. CHK1 phosphorylates and activates NEK11, which in turn directly phosphorylates CDC25A, thereby promoting the SCF\u03b2TRCP-dependent degradation of CDC25A as presented [ The IR-induced G2/M checkpoint can be understood as a process in three phases: initiation, maintenance, and recovery. DNA DSBs formed after exposure to IR can give rise to a variety of chemically heterogeneous DSB ends, including those with modified terminal nucleotides or even protein-DNA adducts, often referred to as \u2018dirty\u2019 ends. IR therapy is normally accompanied by severe side effects and is often not fully effective due to the acquired resistance of tumor cells. For example, the increased radiation sensitivity observed in BRCA2\u2010defective tumors [ Inhibiting the G2/M checkpoint in combination with IR can potentially target a broad range of tumors.", "A recent report has indicated that metformin pretreatment in human MCF7 breast cancer or mouse FSaII fibrosarcoma cells can eradicate radiation-resistant CSCs and enhance IR-induced growth delay in fibrosarcoma tumors [ There are several ongoing studies which look at the use of metformin in cancer therapeutics as documented by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). We thank MIUR-FIRB (RBAP11LP2W, H81J10000030001) and Italian Health Office (TEVERE project) for generous support.", "This provided the compelling rationale for co-targeting IGF-1R and IR. Herein we have developed an approach to simultaneously down-regulate IGF-1R and IR in protein levels. By generating and screening several engineered ubiquitin ligases, we have identified that, PTB-U-box, which is composed of an IGF-1R/IR-binding domain and a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase domain, binds activated IGF-1R/IR and targets their ubiquitination and degradation. Therefore, well-designed engineered ubiquitin ligase represents an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of the cancers with co-expressed IGF-1R/IR. Compared with empty vector and PTB, both PTB-U-box and PTB-RING are able to down-regulate IGF-1R protein in the presence of IGF-1, but PTB-U-box is more potent than PTB-RING ( We examined several cancer cell lines as for endogenous IGF-1R and IR levels, among which HepG2 and HeLa cells were chosen for the further study, because they express high levels of IGF-1R and IR and these receptors are constitutively activated when cultured in the serum-containing complete culture medium ( A, Schematic representation of the engineered ubiquitin ligases. B, PTB-U-box promotes IGF-1R and IR down-regulation. C, PTB-U-box does not change IGF-1R and IR transcription. mRNA levels of IGF-1R (left) and IR (right) were measured by quantitative Real-time PCR. Next, we examined whether PTB-U-box can interact with IGF-1R and IR and promote their ubiquitination. Interaction between engineered ubiquitin ligase and IGF-1R or IR was determined by co-immunoprecipitation assay. IGF-1R and IR ubiquitination were assessed by To further determine whether enhancement of IGF-1R and IR ubiquitination by PTB-U-box result in their degradation, we compared the stability of IGF-1R and IR in PTB and PTB-U-box expressing HeLa cells using cycloheximide (CHX) chase experiment. Activated IGF-1R and IR, through recruiting IRS-1 and other adaptors, is able to activate the downstream Akt and MAPK signaling pathway, both of which play important roles in cell proliferation, migration and survival [ Chemotherapy is a common therapeutic approach for several types of cancers. Cisplatin, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, by binding to and causing crosslink of DNA, can trigger cell apoptosis [ Targeted degradation of IGF-1R and IR attenuates Akt and MAPK signaling and increases the chemo-sensitivity of HepG2 cells. C, The final tumor volume (mm Although IGF-1R and IR are both widely expressed on normal tissues, the strong implications of IGF-1R in various cancers have already been well recognized and therapeutic strategies with antibodies and small molecule TKIs have been actively tested in clinical trials [ Targeted degradation of a specific protein by harnessing the endogenous ubiquitin system represents an alternative approach that knocks down the target protein at protein levels, also known as \u201cprotein knockout\u201d [ There are several obvious advantages of the targeted protein degradation for cancer treatment. Third, this RTKs-targeting degradation strategy can be combined with antibodies or small molecule inhibitors against RTKs, especially when kinase-independent biologic functions of RTKs, such as IGF-1R and EGFR, also contribute to cancer malignancy [ In this study, we have created and screened several engineered ubiquitin ligases which are composed of an IGF-1R/IR-binding domain and a functional ubiquitin ligase domain. Upon ectopic expression, PTB-U-box enhances IGF-1R/IR ubiquitination and degradation, thereby inhibiting several key cancer hallmarks, i.e., proliferation, invasion, drug insensitivity and glucose metabolism, and thus retarding the tumor growth in xenograft. However, the two E3 activity-defective constructs, PTB and PTB-U-box (HQ), have no inhibitory effect on cell malignancies, albeit they are capable of binding to IGF-1R/IR and supposed to interfere with the recruitment of IRS-1 to IGF-1R/IR and downstream signaling to some extent. We reason that, in situation of PTB/PTB-U-box(HQ) overexpression, the unchanged receptors may recruit other adaptors such as IRS-2-4 and thus compensate for IRS-1 interference, which is supported by unchanged Akt and ERK activation. Thus, the efficacy of PTB-U-box attributes to PTB-U-box-caused IGF-1R/IR degradation and subsequent downstream signaling inhibition. Our finding is consistent with the previous studies, showing that IGF-1R and/or IR knockdown inhibits the tumor growth as well as increases the chemo-sensitivity [ In this study, to evaluate the Another major concern for our strategy may be insulin resistance, which may result from PTB-U-box-trigged IR down-regulation, especially in the case of non-selective accumulation of adenoviruses in cancers and the adjacent normal tissues. However, such type of insulin resistance in normal cells, due to decreased IR and IGF-R signaling, could be beneficial, because the concomitant decrease in mTOR activity can slow down aging, prolong life span and prevent cancer [ In summary, herein we artificially created an engineered ubiquitin ligase, which is composed of an IGF-1R/IR-binding domain and a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase domain, so as to target the ubiquitination and degradation of activated IGF-1R/IR. We have provided evidences that such an engineered molecule, PTB-U-box, can effectively degrades IGF-1R/IR, inhibits cell proliferation and invasion, increases chemo-sensitivity and reduces glucose metabolism when ectopically expressed in cancer cells. Therefore, co-targeting IGF-1R and IR for ubiquitination and degradation by well-designed engineered ubiquitin ligase represent an alternative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancers co-expressing IGF-1R/IR. Antibodies against IGF-1R\u03b1, IGF-1R\u03b2, IR\u03b2,\u03b2-Actin and \u03b1-tubulin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA), FLAG and IgG were from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA), and Glut4, Akt, p-Akt(S473), ERK and p-ERK from Cell Signaling (Andover, MA, USA). The primers used were as follows: IGF-1R, 5\u2019-TCTGGCTTGATTGGTCTGGC-3\u2019 (forward), 5\u2019-aaccattggctgtgcagtca-3\u2019 (reverse); IR, 5\u2019-gcctctacaacctgatgaac-3\u2019 (forward), 5\u2019-acagatgtctccacactcc-3\u2019 (reverse); GAPDH, 5\u2019-ctgcaccaccaact gcttag-3\u2019 (forward), 5\u2019-ttctgggtggcagtgatg-3\u2019 (reverse). Then the cells were lysed and the lysates containing 1 to 1.5 mg total proteins were incubated with anti-IGF-1R\u03b1/\u03b2 or anti-IR\u03b2 antibodies for 3 h at 4\u00b0C, followed by incubation with protein A Sepharose beads over night at 4\u00b0C. Then the cells were harvested and cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting analysis to assess the protein stability of IGF-1R and IR.", "Therefore methods directed to ameliorate IR injury are of great importance. We aimed at describing the effects of postconditioning (PC) on the alterations of the intestinal mucosal function and the inflammatory response upon mesenteric IR. The occlusive form of acute mesenteric ischemia is mainly attributed to the embolization of the SMA, leaving the thrombosis of a preexistent atherosclerotic lesion to be the secondary cause of intestinal infarctions [ The IR injury is mainly characterized by the release of free radicals at the early stage of reperfusion [ The protection of organs from IR injury has always been an immense challenge for surgeons. Postconditioning has been stated to be a suitable method to ameliorate IR injury in various animal models [ The present study was mainly designed to evaluate the effects of postconditioning on the intestinal mucosal permeability in a widely used rat model of mesenteric IR, which is capable of recreating events present during the occlusive entities of acute mesenteric ischemia [ The experiments were performed with pGLO plasmid containing GFP-expressing Inbred male Wistar rats, weighing 250\u2013280 g, were used (Charles River Hungary Ltd., Budapest, Hungary). During the IR period, the animal's abdomen was covered with a plastic blanket to prevent fluid loss via evaporation. The groups subjected to IR, however, had a variable range of detectable GFP-expressing Regarding the histologic samples stained with hematoxylin and eosin, in the sham-group no remarkable morphologic changes were observed in the three small bowel segments. In contrast, relevant changes were observed in the groups subjected to IR when compared to the sham-operated group. No statistically significant differences were observed in the duodenum samples between the IR- and the PC-group ( In the samples of the sham-operated animals, claudin-2 was weakly stained in all the three small intestinal segments. The two groups exposed to IR presented higher claudin-2 membrane expression, with a marked accumulation in the lateral membranes of the epithelial cells. Jejunal and ileal segments of the IR-group showed significantly major claudin-2 membrane positivity compared with the samples of the postconditioned group. Mesenteric IR caused a dramatic decrease of claudin-3 expression in the epithelial cells of the jejunum and ileum. The percentage of intestinal epithelial cells with claudin-4 membrane expression did not differ significantly between the IR- and postconditioned-groups. Following mesenteric IR samples taken from the jejunum and ileum displayed significantly lower ZO-1 membrane expression. However, the jejunal and ileal sections of the postconditioned group presented significantly more intestinal epithelial cells with ZO-1 membrane staining compared with the IR-group ( Chemiluminescent intensity, which is proportional to the concentration of ROS in the examined sample, was significantly increased in the two groups challenged with mesenteric IR in comparison to the sham-operated group. This effect was tendentiously seen when comparing the duodenum homogenates of the IR- and the PC-groups ( The plasma I-FABP levels rose significantly upon mesenteric IR, which was significantly attenuated in the PC-group. There was a significant elevation in the plasma D-lactate levels detected in the groups exposed to IR, when compared with the sham-operated group. The level of plasma D-lactate measured in the PC-group was significantly lower than in the IR-group. It has been claimed that most of the intestinal tissue damage occurs after the reinitiation of tissue perfusion [ The present study was elaborated to examine the effects of postconditioning on the mucosal IR injury of the small intestine in a model of 60 minutes of SMA occlusion and 6 hours of reperfusion. The 60 minutes of ischemia was set as a period long enough to induce measurable and reproducible damage of the intestinal mucosa [ Mesenteric IR caused remarkable intestinal mucosal injury, mainly in segments of the jejunum and the ileum, generating extensive epithelial detachment from the lamina propria and few denudated villi. The plasma I-FABP levels were assessed as a sensitive serological marker of intestinal mucosal injury [ The intact intestinal unicellular epithelium serves as the only physical barrier between the luminal bacterial milieu and the sterile bloodstream [ The decrease of \u201csealing\u201d tight junction proteins and the increase of pore forming claudins indicate a perturbed epithelial layer [ The detrimental effects of mesenteric IR on the intestinal mucosal function are mainly mediated by the overproduction of free radicals [ The release of free radicals during reperfusion has been shown to activate NF- Our study has some limitations. We used a sublethal model of intestinal IR and thus associations between the use of postconditioning and mortality rates cannot be made. This study demonstrates the detrimental effects of mesenteric IR on the intestinal mucosal barrier function through the generation of ROS and the alteration of several tight junction components. Postconditioning seems to be an efficient method to timely and accurately target the site of ROS production and action, thus ameliorating IR injury. The ischemia-reperfusion- (IR-) group (b) shows several denudated villi with partial digestion, as shown by the black arrow. The sham-operated group presented strong membrane claudin-3 immunostaining (d), which was remarkably decreased in the ischemia-reperfusion- (IR-) group (e), but not in the postconditioned- (PC-) group (f). Following small intestinal ischemia-reperfusion, intestinal epithelial cell with zonula occludens-1 membrane immunostaining notably decreased in the IR-group (k); in the PC-group minimal loss of zonula occludens-1 membrane immunostaining was detected (l).

Thus UFAs may improve muscle insulin sensitivity and counteract SFA-mediated IR through an effect on macrophage activation. It is well-established that accumulation of lipid derivatives in skeletal muscle results in IR ( It is as yet unclear whether FAs or other lipid derivatives are responsible for direct activation of macrophages or if macrophages are activated by signals from other tissues or cells, given the extensive cross-talk that occurs between adipocytes and infiltrating inflammatory cells ( Whereas some studies have demonstrated that macrophages accumulate in tissues other than adipose during obesity, including skeletal muscle (( Recently, palmitic acid-treated macrophages were shown to generate conditioned medium (CM) that reduced glucose uptake and PI3K signalling and increased inflammatory signalling in GLUT4-overexpressing L6 myoblasts ( General reagents were from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (Gillingham, Dorset, UK), cell culture media from Gibco (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) and recombinant TNF\u03b1 from eBiosciences (Hatfield, UK). pY612-IRS1 antibody was from Biosource International (Camarillo, CA, USA), total IRS-1 and total glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3\u03b2 antibodies from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA), \u03b2-actin antibody from Sigma and all others from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverley, MA, USA). Macrophages were treated with 200 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for 3 days before use ( Where pharmacological inhibitors were used, myotubes were pre-treated for 1 h with 1 \u03bcM SB203580 and 0.1 \u03bcM BIRB796, 1 \u03bcM JNK V inhibitor, or vehicle (DMSO), before being treated with CM containing the same substances for 16 h. Where siRNA was employed, C2C12s were transfected with 50 nM nonsense or p38\u03b1 MAPK-targeting siRNA pool using Dharmafect 3 (Dharmacon, Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) on day 2 of differentiation and then left for 72 h before treatment with CM. Both LPS- and palm-mac-CM caused increases in pY182-p38 MAPK ( As previous findings have suggested that activation of the NF\u03baB pathway did not contribute to the generation of IR in muscle The effects of MAPK and JNK inhibition on myotube glycogen synthesis and signalling were investigated next. Macrophage activation is classically defined as either M1 (pro-inflammatory) or M2 (anti-inflammatory), according to cellular iNOS and arginase activities ( M1-activated macrophages secrete a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines that activate inflammatory pathways in adjacent cells, therefore the levels of 2 pro-inflammatory cytokines and 2 pro-inflammatory chemokines that could be implicated in muscle IR ( As palm-mac-CM contained elevated levels of TNF\u03b1 and this increase was prevented by co-incubation with palmitoleic acid, we aimed to establish whether TNF\u03b1 might be responsible for the induction of myotube IR by palm-mac-CM. Insulin caused the expected increases in phosphorylation of all signalling intermediates in control-mac-CM myotubes (all In this study, we have utilised a model involving macrophage treatment with an SFA, a UFA or a combination of these and application of the CM generated to differentiated C2C12 myotubes in culture to determine whether and how increased local infiltration of macrophages into skeletal muscle during obesity (( Our data are generally consistent with a recent study in which CM generated by palmitate treatment of RAW macrophages caused reductions in glucose uptake and insulin-stimulated signalling in GLUT4-overexpressing L6 myoblasts ( Numerous publications have suggested that stress kinases such as JNK, p38 MAPK and IKK serine phosphorylate IRS1, leading to reduced tyrosine phosphorylation and thus reduced downstream signalling to glucose disposal ( Of the four cytokines/chemokines measured here, only TNF\u03b1 secretion was significantly increased by palmitic acid treatment, but the importance of this finding was confirmed by repeating myotube incubation with palm-mac-CM in the presence of a TNF-\u03b1 blocking antibody. This cytokine also played a role in mediating the effects of palm-mac-CM on L6 myoblasts ( We have shown that macrophages treated with palmitoleic acid alone generated CM that was insulin sensitising, as well as increasing basal glycogen synthesis, while addition of palmitoleic acid to a palmitic acid incubation is also capable of preventing the IR associated with the palm-mac-CM-induced activation of MAPKs, suggesting an additional mechanism whereby UFAs have insulin sensitising effects in skeletal muscle. Importantly, the beneficial effects of palmitoleic acid have also been demonstrated We have demonstrated that IR in muscle may at least in part result from the effects of SFAs on local macrophages, causing release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, paracrine activation of stress signalling in adjacent muscle fibres and thus impaired insulin-stimulated glucose incorporation into glycogen. Further work must aim to establish whether this represents a quantitatively important mechanism of generation of muscle IR This work was funded by a Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (UK) Doctoral Training Grant PhD Scholarship and a research grant from the Royal Society. Conditioned medium from macrophages treated with palmitic acid, LPS or vehicle (control group) was incubated with or without SB205380 (1 \u03bcM) and BIRB796 (0.1 \u03bcM), JNK V (1 \u03bcM) inhibitors or vehicle for 16 h. After cells were serum starved for 1 h and treated with 100nM insulin for 15 min, they were collected in RIPA buffer and phosphorylation and total protein levels of (A) p38 MAPK (pY182), (B) p46 JNK (pT183/pY185) and (C) p54 JNK (pT183/pY185) were assessed by SDS\u2013PAGE and immunoblotting.

In vitro ovarian IR was also induced by DEX for 3 days. Cryptotanshinone reversed DEX-induced androgen excess and ovarian IR in mice through activation of insulin signaling and the regulation of glucose transporters and hormone-synthesizing enzymes.", "GFP-Tip60 was expressed in DT40 cells, immunoprecipitated and used in an Tip60 acetylation is required for activation of the ATM kinase and phosphorylation of H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) following DNA double strand breaks Tip60 expression has been implicated in both prostate and breast cancer Quantification of \u03b3H2AX foci in response to TH1834 alone revealed no significant difference in MCF10A cells ( Following 2 Gy IR treatment, both MCF10A and MCF7 demonstrated a significant [P < 0.01(**)] increase in \u03b3H2AX foci ( To investigate the mechanism of action of TH1834 activation of the apoptotic pathway was monitored, through the cleavage and activation of caspase 3 in the luminal breast cancer cells MCF7 and the non-tumorigenic myoepithelial (basal) MCF10A breast cells ( Investigating the dose response of TH1834, treatment significantly reduced the viability of MCF7 cells at the highest concentrations ( Tip60 plays important roles in chromatin remodeling, genomic stability and in initiating the DNA double strand break response We designed a targeted ligand (TH1834), which demonstrated inhibitory activity against Tip60 and Tip60-dependent signalling both Interestingly, we found that PNT treatment did not inhibit activity in our Furthermore, we demonstrate the inhibitory activity of TH1834 is specific to Tip60 as basal acetylation of H4K16 and H4K8 were not reduced following TH1834 treatment in breast cancer cells. TH1834 induces \u03b3H2AX IRIF. Indicated Breast cancer cell lines pre-treated with 500 \u03bcM of TH1834 for 1 hr prior to 2 Gy IR treatment and stained for \u03b3H2AX (Red) and DNA (Blue).

However, the consequences of the IR-induced activation of the UPR signaling pathway on radiosensitivity in intestinal epithelial cells remain to be determined. In this study, we investigated the role of ER stress responses in IR-induced intestinal epithelial cell death. We show that chemical ER stress inducers, such as tunicamycin or thapsigargin, enhanced IR-induced caspase 3 activation and DNA fragmentation in intestinal epithelial cells. Knockdown of Xbp1 or Atf6 with small interfering RNA inhibited IR-induced caspase 3 activation. Treatment with chemical chaperones prevented ER stress and subsequent apoptosis in IR-exposed intestinal epithelial cells. Our results suggest a pro-apoptotic role of ER stress in IR-exposed intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, inhibiting ER stress may be an effective strategy to prevent IR-induced intestinal injury.", "These mice have decreased circulating monocyte population and altered ATM profile in WAT (a dramatic reduction in inflammatory classically activated macrophages [M1] and expansion in alternatively activated macrophages [M2]), which could improve HFD-induced IR. Anti-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1; Ser Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Obesity-induced chronic inflammation is critical in the pathogenesis of IR and other metabolic diseases ( It has been reported that cold stress or IL-4 can enhance M2 in BAT and WAT ( Recent studies indicated that ATM arises from a lineage that includes BM precursors and blood monocytes ( In our previous studies, we showed that regulating RIP140 levels in macrophages controls the inflammatory response, including endotoxin tolerance ( In conclusion, RIP140 is involved in regulating monocyte and ATM homeostasis.", "Therefore, we examined the expression of IR and its prognostic significance in clear cell RCC (CCRCC). Immunohistochemical staining for IR was performed on 126 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded CCRCC tissue samples. IR was expressed in the nuclei of CCRCC tumor cells in 109 cases (87.9%). Higher IR expression was significantly correlated with the presence of cystic change, lower Fuhrman nuclear grade, lower pathologic T stage, and lower TNM stage, although it wasn't significantly related to diabetes status and patient survival. IR expression in CCRCC may be associated with favorable prognostic factors. The sections were washed with reaction buffer followed by incubation with primary IR-\u03b2 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) at a 1:100 dilution for 60 min at 42\u2103. The blocked membranes were washed with TBS-T buffer and incubated overnight at 4\u2103 in primary IR-\u03b2 (Abcam) and \u03b2-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) antibodies, diluted 1:1000 and 1:5000, respectively. The membranes were then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in Anti-Mouse IgG-HRP secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using dilutions of 1:2000 for IR-\u03b2 and 1:5000 for \u03b2-actin. To determine if IR has any prognostic value, we carried out correlation analysis between IR expression and the well known prognostic factors for RCC. The analysis of IR expression in fresh tissue showed that the level of IR protein was inversely correlated with Fuhrman nuclear grade of CCRCC ( We also compared the staining score of each group to overcome the potential limitations with respect to quantification in IHC assays. The mean staining score of IR was 5.45\u00b11.79 in cases with cystic change and 4.52\u00b11.90 in cases without cystic change, which was a statistically significant difference ( Prognosis of RCC can be predicted using several well-known prognostic factors. IR exists in two isoforms, A and B, which are formed due to exclusion (isoform A) or inclusion (isoform B) of exon 11 of the IR gene. In conclusion, IR expression was studied in CCRCC and its expression was compared with clinico-pathological parameters and survival data. We demonstrated that higher nuclear IR expression was significantly correlated with favorable prognostic factors of CCRCC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on IR expression in CCRCC patients with known diabetes status and prognosis. Caveats to our study include our small study sample size and the fact that we only performed analysis at the level of IR protein expression. (A) Immunohistochemical staining for IR in tumor and non-tumor tissue from same patient. Nuclear and/or cytoplasmic immunoreactivity of IR in podocytes (arrow), normal tubular epithelium, and lymphocytes in non-tumor tissues (left side) and nuclear positivity of IR in tumor cells (right side).

Results of survival analysis shows no significant difference between the IR positive and IR negative groups in both survival (A) and recurrence rates (B).", "A study on a rat model of sporadic AD generated by the intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of a sub-diabetogenic dose of streptozotocin (STZ) demonstrated that the insulin-resistant brain state is accompanied by the occurrence of mitochondrial abnormalities [ In a recent study on microvascular endothelial cells from rat (RBMEC) and mice (MBMEC) isolated from adult Sprague-Dawley rats and homozygous db/db (Lepr In addition to A\u03b2 pathology, insulin reportedly could regulate Tau phosphorylation in neuronal cells [ Patients with AD pathology demonstrated the concomitant presence of mitochondrial bioenergetics failure, increased OS and reduced insulin signaling as consequence of increased A\u03b2 and levels of hyperphosphorylated tau ( The mechanism of protection by insulin appears to involve the restoration of the Akt/mTOR/S6K signaling pathway within AD neurons that when aberrantly modulated may increase IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser Elevated levels of AGE represent another common pathological marker of both T2DM and AD. From a molecular point of view, the lack of interaction between insulin and IR is associated with an increase of the inhibitory phosphorylation on insulin receptor substrate-1/2 (IRS1/2) on Ser312, 616 and 636, which, in turn, negatively impacts on the two main arms of insulin-mediated signaling cascade: the PI3K and the MAPK pathways, both involved in the maintenance of synaptic plasticity and cell stress response. Although insulin resistance and A\u03b2 production can be considered leading causes of the rise of oxidative stress, this latter, in turn, promotes IRS-1/2 Ser-312, -616 and -636 phosphorylation as well as the oxidative damage of protein involved in glycolysis, the Krebs cycle and ATP synthesis that are crucial events in the reduction of glucose metabolism and thus insulin resistance.", "IR was assessed by the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index in euglycemic cirrhosis of varied etiology and in different stages of cirrhosis. Overall IR in euglycemic cirrhosis was seen in 68.5%. IR was seen in the order hepatitis C (100%), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (100%), autoimmune hepatitis (100%), hepatocellular carcinoma (80%), alcoholic liver disease (72%) and hepatitis B (45%). HOMA-IR value was raised in Child Turcotte Pugh (CTP) score >9 (P value 0.0004) and model of end stage liver disease (MELD) score >15 (P value 0.02). IR is common in euglycemic cirrhosis and with advancement of liver disease; there is a compensatory increase in pancreatic \u03b2-cell insulin secretion to overcome the IR. An association between diabetes mellitus and liver cirrhosis was first described by Bohan [ The aim of the study was to investigate: 1) IR in euglycemic cirrhosis of varied etiology. 2) IR in different stages of cirrhosis. diabetes mellitus was diagnosed using the American Diabetes Association criteria [ IR was assessed by the Homeostasis Model Assessment method for the evaluation of IR (HOMA-IR). HOMA was first developed in 1985 by Matthews HOMA calculator 2.2 was used to calculate the HOMA IR and HOMA-\u03b2 values while QUICKI values were calculated with a scientific calculator. Baseline characteristics The Spearman coefficient correlation between IR and varied euglycemic cirrhosis was very significant (R=1). IR was seen in all cases of NAFLD, AIH and HCV (genotype 3) related euglycemic cirrhosis ( Insulin resistance of varied etiology in euglycemic cirrhosis Insulin resistance in varied etiology of euglycemic cirrhosis HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; AIH, autoimmune hepatitis; NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; HCV, hepatitis C virus; HBV, hepatitis B virus; ALD, alcoholic liver disease HOMA-IR in euglycemic and diabetic cirrhosis CTP, Child Turcotte Pugh; MELD, model for end-stage liver disease; DM, diabetes mellitus HOMA-IR and HOMA-b correlation with CTP score MELD score was divided into three groups, i.e., <10; 10-15; and >15, which correlated well with CTP score. Similar to CTP score, the IR is most commonly seen in cases with advanced cirrhosis with MELD score >15 (82%, P=0.03). HOMA-IR and QUICKI correlated well, and a higher IR was seen in MELD score >15 as compared to MELD score 10-15 and less than 10 (P value 0.02 and 0.01, respectively). Controls (diseased) had a higher HOMA-IR value, but no significant alteration was seen among the three different groups of MELD score ( HOMA-IR and HOMA b correlation with MELD score HOMA-\u03b2 a parameter reflecting the insulin secretion ability of pancreatic \u03b2-cells was evaluated in euglycemic cirrhotic with different CTP score and MELD score. HOMA-\u03b2 level is lower in MELD score 10-15 than in MELD score <10, but patients with MELD score >15 have a much higher value as compared to other groups; likewise, HOMA-\u03b2 levels were comparable between patients with CTP A and B but significantly elevated in CTP C ( HOMA-\u03b2 values in euglycemic and diabetic cirrhosis CTP, Child Turcotte Pugh; MELD, model for end-stage liver disease; DM, diabetes mellitus In our study, IR in euglycemic cirrhosis was seen in 68.5%, whereas it was universally present in cirrhotic patients with recent onset diabetes. The cut off of IR was taken with HOMA-IR value >1.64 and QUICKI <0.35 which has been validated in many studies [ HCV Chronic ALD is mediated by combined effects of IR and toxic injury. Hepatic IR is caused by defects in intracellular signaling, including impairments in receptor binding and receptor tyrosine kinase activation. Ethanol also inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate proteins, needed to transmit insulin and insulin-like growth factor receptor signals [ Several studies suggest that type 2 diabetes mellitus may have an etiological role in chronic liver disease and HCC regardless of alcohol and viruses [ A decrease in islet mass and/or \u03b2-cell dysfunction is a pathogenetic mechanism for type 2 diabetes mellitus [ In conclusion, our study justifies the hypothesis that with advancement of liver disease there is progressive increase in IR and also compensatory increase in pancreatic \u03b2-cell function occurs which counteracts IR at the receptor level. However, with prolonged or sustained IR pancreatic \u03b2-cell function loss occurs, which may result in the development of hepatogenous diabetes.", "Early-onset obesity is a definite risk factor for adult obesity, its associated comorbidities and reduced life expectancy [ Consequently, analysis of the serum proteome of young children in different weight-related conditions (normal, excess and later reduction), with or without IR, could be useful for the detection of new more sensitive diagnostic biomarkers. The following sets of comparison were established in order to achieve the proposed objectives avoiding any possible bias derived from differences in the process of sample preservation: 1) Influence of obesity on serum proteomic profile: OB (n = 22) 2) Differences in the serum proteome due to insulin resistance: Pros-OB group at baseline (B): IR (n = 11) 3) Effect of extensive weight reduction on serum proteomic profile: Pros-OB: Paired comparison between time-points D and WL (n = 20 at each time-point). As expected, significant negative correlations were found between BMI-SDS and several isoforms of Apo-A1, clusterin/Apo J , vD-BP and haptoglobin isoforms with high MW, whereas positive correlation coefficients were observed exclusively with those haptoglobin isoforms with a lower MW, including spot #8102 (Table Correlation between BMI-SDS and protein spot intensity Correlation coefficients (Spearman\u2019s rho) and significance levels between patient\u2019s standardized BMI (SDS) and protein spot intensity in the whole cohort of 43 prepubertal children studied, made up of 22 obese ( Comparison of the serum proteomic profile between IR (n = 11) and non-IR (n = 9) obese children (the Pros-OB group at diagnosis) allowed for the analysis of 237 protein spots, with 12 of them showing differences between groups (p < 0.05). Among the observed changes, it was remarkable that the presence of IR in obese children induced a further down-regulation of isoforms of Apo-A1 (#3101; #4101; #4103) and clusterin/Apo J (#3301; #4402). In contrast, no significant differences between the IR and non-IR groups were found in serum levels of clusterin/Apo J (54.67 \u00b1 14.70 vs. 56.87 \u00b1 14.80 mg/dl), Apo-A1 (235.4 \u00b1 74.4 vs. 250.5 \u00b1 79.4 mg/dl) or HDL (45.79 \u00b1 8.82 vs. 45.89 \u00b1 10.40 mg/dl) using standard immuno and enzymatic assays. IR obese children also showed an increased expression of the 4 low MW isoforms of haptoglobin (#3002; #7101; #8101; #9101) and one of \u03b11-AT (#1703), whereas the haptoglobin isoforms with the highest MWs (#4503; #5503) were down-regulated. When analyzed by ELISA, no significant differences between the IR and non-IR groups were found in serum levels of haptoglobin (202.7 \u00b1 109.6 vs. 149.5 \u00b1 49.5) or \u03b11-AT (124.6 \u00b1 60.1 vs. 115.2 \u00b1 70.8). We have also demonstrated how insulin resistance, the first step in obesity associated impairment of carbohydrate metabolism, enhances these changes in the degree of expression of specific isoforms of proteins related to inflammation (haptoglobin) and metabolism (ApoA1), some of them correlating with serum levels of adipokines, such as IL-6 and NAMPT/visfatin, with a known role in IR. One of the proteins significantly found to be affected in obesity associated IR is Apo-A1. Secondly, when obese children display IR, Apo-A1 production is more severely impaired. Finally, it is important to emphasize that the sensitivity of the standard methodology used in daily practice to determine HDL and Apo-A1 is insufficient to detect these initial changes in lipid metabolism demonstrated by 2DE under the presence of IR. This could suggest the loss of its postulated anti-atherogenic and lipid-lowering effects in direct relationship to of the degree of excess BMI and being further intensified with the onset of IR. This change was enhanced when comparing obese IR children with obese non-IR children, whereas weight loss causes the opposite effect, inducing an increase in higher MW haptoglobin isoforms and a decrease in the low MW ones. This could explain the limited ability of ELISA assays, which detect the different isoforms of haptoglobin as a pool, to discriminate these complex changes (as observed in the comparison between IR and non-IR). In effect, the two alleles for haptoglobin (1 and 2) give rise to three major phenotypes (Hp1-1, Hp2-2 and Hp2-1), each of them with different capacities to form homo- or hetero-polymers of haptoglobin [ The increase in the synthesis of low MW isoforms of haptoglobin in obesity, and further when it associates IR, could be interpreted as a component of the low-degree inflammation state accompanying obesity, which is already present in early ages [ The lack of significance after FDR analysis of the increase in alpha 1 antitrypsin levels, another acute phase protein, as a consequence of IR in 2DE analysis as in ELISA does not allow any conclusion to be made, although its variations might be expected due to the existence of a proinflammatory environment. Transtyretin is bound to RBP4 in plasma and an elevation in RBP4 is thought to contribute to the development of IR associated with obesity and T2DM [ Regarding the changes observed in protein spot intensity in the three sets of comparison, losing their significance after FDR analysis, it should be pointed that, although correction for multiple comparisons is considered statistically recommendable to avoid rejecting the null hypothesis too readily, some author postulate that it should be avoided. This is explained on the basis that reducing the type I error for null associations increases the type II error for those associations that are not null; thus suggesting that a policy of not making adjustments for multiple comparisons could be preferable because it will lead to fewer errors of interpretation when the data are actual observations on nature [ Our results suggest that changes in some isoforms of circulating peptides, mainly related to inflammation and lipid metabolism, accompany the early onset of obesity and IR in childhood. Some of these changes are undetectable by methods routinely used in the clinic under certain conditions, such as IR. In addition, this proteomic approach has allowed for the identification of several candidate proteins (including ApoJ/clustering, vitaminD binding protein, transthyretin) whose dynamics in childhood obesity and IR need further validation, but could result in novel biomarkers for the risk of development of obesity related metabolic complications. ; HDL: High density lipoprotein; HOMA: Homeostasis model assessment; HMW-adiponectin: High molecular weight adiponectin; IL-6: Interleukin 6; IR: Insulin resistance; LDL: Low density lipoprotein; MS: Mass spectrometry; MS-MS: Tandem mass spectrometry; OB: Obese; OGTT: Oral glucose tolerance test; Pros-OB: Prospectively followed obese cohort; RBP4: Retinol binding protein 4; SA: HMW to T adiponectin ratio; SDS: Standard deviation score; T2DM: Type 2 diabetes mellitus; T-adiponectin: Total adiponectin; TNF-\u03b1: Tumoral necrosis factor alpha; vD-BP: Vitamin D binding protein; VLDL: Very low density lipoprotein; WL: Study timepoint after weight loss.", "The levels of (312)Ser-IRS-1 also did not improve postpartum and correlated with TNF-alpha mRNA (r(2) = 0.19, P < 0.03), consistent with a state of subclinical inflammation and chronic skeletal muscle insulin resistance. These results suggest the mechanisms underlying chronic insulin resistance in GDM women may be driven by increased inflammation that impinges on the IR and IRS-1 signaling cascade in skeletal muscle.", "Because increased visceral fat (VF) is associated with IR in nonpregnant states, we reasoned that fat accretion might be important in the development of IR during pregnancy. To determine whether VF depots increase in pregnancy and whether VF contributes to IR, we studied three groups of 6-mo-old female Sprague-Dawley rats: 1) nonpregnant sham-operated rats (Nonpreg; n = 6), 2) pregnant sham-operated rats (Preg; n = 6), and 3) pregnant rats in which VF was surgically removed 1 mo before mating (PVF-; n = 6). Glucose IR (mg.kg(-1).min(-1)) was highest in Nonpreg (19.4 +/- 2.0), lowest in Preg (11.1 +/- 1.4), and intermediate in PVF- (14.7 +/- 0.6; P < 0.001 between all groups). Accretion of visceral fat is an important component in the development of hepatic IR in pregnancy, and accumulation of hepatic triglycerides is a mechanism by which visceral fat may modulate insulin action in pregnancy.", "Twenty-four Wistar-Albino rats were randomized into four groups (n = 6) as follows: Control (sham laparotomy), Aortic IR (30 min ischemia and 120 min reperfusion), L-Arginine (intraperitoneal 100 mg kg(-1) live weight)+aortic IR, and L: -NAME (intraperitoneal 10 mg kg(-1) live weight)+aortic IR. Aortic IR increased MDA, VEGF, and NO. L-Arginine further significantly increased MDA and NO, and decreased VEGF (P < 0.05 vs aortic IR). L-NAME significantly decreased MDA and NO (P < 0.05 vs L-arginine+aortic IR) and increased VEGF (P < 0.05 vs other groups). A histological examination showed the aortic IR to significantly increase (P < 0.05 vs control) while L-arginine also further increased (P > 0.05 vs aortic IR), whereas L-NAME caused a significant decrease in pulmonary leukocyte infiltration (P < 0.05 vs aortic IR). Our results indicate that L-arginine aggravates the lung injury induced by aortic IR, while L-NAME attenuates it.", "RECQ1 depletion by RNA interference resulted in reduced cell proliferation, compromised cellular resistance to IR or camptothecin (CPT), and elevated sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in cells either untreated or exposed to CPT, suggesting that RECQ1 is important for the repair of endogenous or exogenously induced DNA damage. Cells (transfected with either the control or two different RECQ1 siRNAs) were seeded in quadruplicate at a density of 300 cells/well in 96-well plates, allowed to adhere for 14\u201316 h, and subsequently exposed to increasing doses of IR using Gammacell 40 (Nordion International, Inc.), a Cells transfected with control or RECQ1 siRNA were used for radioresistant DNA synthesis assays 48 h after transfection. Cells were labeled for 24 h with 10 nCi/ml [ SCEs were detected as described HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes to about 70% confluence were untreated or treated with IR (10 Gy). Six h after IR treatment, the cells were processed for immunofluorescent staining. For detection of chromatin bound protein, the U2OS cells that were either untreated or exposed to IR (10 Gy) and allowed to recover for 6 h were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation. Although RECQ1 is not implicated as of yet in a human disease, studies of cells from RECQL knockout mice suggested a role of RECQ1 in the maintenance of chromosomal stability and the repair of double strand breaks First, we examined by immunofluorescence the sub-cellular distribution of endogenous RECQ1 in human cells either untreated or exposed to IR which directly introduces DNA strand breaks. In untreated HeLa cells, RECQ1 displayed nuclear staining with a predominant localization in nucleoli ( Indirect immunofluorescence was performed on HeLa cells that were either untreated or allowed to recover for 6 h from 10 Gy IR exposure as described in \u201c Since the more well characterized BLM helicase has been implicated in the cellular response to replicative stress We next sought to determine if endogenous RECQ1 would be associated with damaged DNA. Nuclear proteins from U2OS cells either untreated or harvested 6 h following IR (10 Gy) exposure were fractionated into soluble nuclear, chromatin, or nuclear matrix components ( A critical element of the DNA damage response is the activation of signaling pathways by protein phosphorylation to initiate repair by HR The proposed roles of RecQ helicases in replication fork processing suggested that RECQ1 status may influence cellular growth and proliferation. The elevated IR sensitivity and sister chromatid exchange in RECQL knockout mouse cells siRNA knockdown of RECQ1 in HeLa cells leads to increased sensitivity to treatment with IR ( Evidence that RecQ helicases function to preserve genomic stability at stalled or broken replication forks To determine whether DNA damage signaling is compromised upon RECQ1 depletion, we examined the DNA damage-induced G2/M checkpoint in RECQ1 siRNA-treated cells. HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated siRNA and were either mock-treated or subjected to 3 Gy IR 48 h after transfection. As expected, very few of the control siRNA-treated cells entered mitosis after 3 Gy of IR ( To determine if RECQ1 is required for the maintenance of the G2/M checkpoint, cells were irradiated (10 Gy) and incubated in the presence of nocodazole for 16 h to capture cells entering mitosis. Depletion of RECQ1 renders cells sensitive to IR or the topoisomerase inhibitor CPT, and results in spontaneous \u03b3-H2AX foci and elevated SCE, indicating an accumulation of double strand breaks. The significant reduction in cell proliferation due to RECQ1 depletion in human cells is different from that observed in mice in which RECQ1 deficiency had no obvious effect on the growth/proliferation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts nor the normal development or postnatal growth of mice It is conceivable that manifestation of cellular or organismal phenotypes in In addition to their growth defects, RECQ1-depleted human cells display defective maintenance of the G2/M checkpoint following IR exposure and an aberrant apoptotic response to H Intra-nuclear trafficking of nuclear proteins is an important aspect of the DNA damage response since DNA repair factors are known to localize to DNA damage foci. RECQ1 is predominantly found in the nucleoli of proliferating human cells and re-localizes to the nucleoplasm in response to IR-induced DNA damage or replicational stress induced by hydroxyurea. Like RECQ1, WRN and BLM also re-localize to the nucleoplasm after DNA damage Most of the RECQ1 is loosely tethered to the nucleus; however, a subset of RECQ1 molecules becomes resistant to detergent extraction after IR exposure, probably due to their tighter association with sites of damage in chromatin. We acknowledge the NIA IRP Flow Cytometry Laboratory (NIH) (Dr. Robert Wersto and Christa Morris) for assistance with FACS analysis.", "Mammalian cells deficient in these NHEJ components share phenotypes that include sensitivity to IR, impaired V(D)J recombination, and predisposition to malignancy, underscoring their critical role in DSB repair . For example, polynucleotide kinase (PNK), with its ability to process IR-induced 5\u2032-hydroxyl and 3\u2032-phosphate DNA termini , functions in NHEJ via a mechanism coordinated by XRCC4 . APLF (also referred to as PALF or Xip1) has been recently reported to possess endonuclease and 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease activities, to accumulate at sites of SSBs or DSBs induced by DNA damaging agents, and to be required for cellular resistance to specific SSB- or DSB-inducing agents, including IR . We show that APLF undergoes ATM-dependent hyperphosphorylation following IR and that APLF is directly phosphorylated by ATM . As shown in A, a proportion of APLF migrates more slowly when cells are subjected either to etoposide or IR. Therefore, we initially subjected DNA\u2013PKcs-deficient (MO59J) or -proficient (MO59K) cells to 5Gy of IR, and APLF mobility was analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in D, APLF undergoes IR-induced hyperphosphorylation to a similar extent in both cell types, indicating that DNA\u2013PKcs is not the major kinase responsible for the observed mobility shift after DNA damage. Therefore, we also examined endogenous APLF phosphorylation in ATM cells derived from SV40-transformed human fibroblasts from A\u2013T patients and from normal controls (ATM) following IR. As shown in E, a substantial defect in IR-induced APLF hyperphosphorylation was detected in the ATM cell extracts as compared to the ATM wild-type cells. These results suggest that IR-induced APLF hyperphosphorylation is largely ATM-dependent, although it does not completely exclude the possibility of some DNA\u2013PKcs-dependent APLF phosphorylation under certain conditions. To delineate which site(s) on APLF were being phosphorylated in response to IR, we performed site-directed mutagenesis at the sites most predictive of ATM phosphorylation (Ser-116, Ser-144 and Ser-246), and mutated each serine residue to alanine. As demonstrated in G, only the APLF mutant protein harboring the alanine substitution at residue 116 exhibited reduced IR-induced phosphorylation, as demonstrated by the lack of a hyperphosphorylated APLF species (indicated by the arrow in G). Although other APLF residues may undergo IR-induced phosphorylation, the data are consistent with APLF being phosphorylated in response to IR at serine 116, a residue which is highly conserved across mammalian APLF homologues (A). APLF IR-induced hyperphosphorylation did not appear to alter APLF subcellular localization, as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy, or APLF interactions with Ku or XRCC4-DNA ligase IV (data not shown). Therefore, the specific role of IR-induced APLF hyperphosphorylation is not clear, but may represent a novel link between ATM and NHEJ. Depletion of APLF from human cells is associated with radiosensitivity in clonogenic survival assays and with a persistence of \u03b3-H2AX foci, a correlate for DSB formation, following IR . APLF was noted to be both basally phosphorylated, and hyperphosphorylated at Ser-116 in an ATM-dependent manner following treatment with IR, consistent with a recent report . ATM also has a direct role in NHEJ and is important for the repair of approximately 10% of IR-induced DSBs thought to correspond to the repair of DSBs repaired with slow kinetics . Although we do not demonstrate a mechanistic function for APLF in NHEJ, a role in NHEJ is suggested by its endogenous interactions with the core NHEJ components, XRCC4, DNA ligase IV and Ku, its predominantly nuclear localization, the deleterious effect of siRNA-mediated downregulation of APLF on plasmid DNA integration, and the ATM-dependent phosphorylation of APLF following IR. These findings as well as the association of APLF with DNA-bound Ku suggest that APLF may be an important repair factor recruited to IR-induced DSBs that may enhance XRCC4-DNA ligase IV-mediated DNA end-joining, perhaps of a specific class of DSBs.", "Moreover, SKu2-YFP foci formed in response to IR in non-dividing bacteroids, indicating that NHEJ system is functional even during the chronic infection phase of symbiosis.", "Our data also show that lovastatin treatment was associated with an increase in insulin-stimulated insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway in the liver and muscle of HFD-fed rats in parallel with a decrease in the inflammatory pathway (c-jun N-terminal kinase and I kappa beta kinase (IKKbeta)/inhibitor of kappaB/nuclear factor kappaB) related to insulin resistance. In summary, statin treatment improves insulin sensitivity in HFD-fed rats by reversing the decrease in the insulin-stimulated IRS-1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway in liver and muscle. The effect of statins on insulin action is further supported by our findings that HFD rats treated with statin show a reduction in IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, I kappa kinase (IKK)/inhibitor of kappaB/nuclear factor kappaB pathway, and c-jun N-terminal kinase activity, associated with an improvement in insulin action.", "Western blots showed that apoptotic proteins (p53, Caspase-3 and -9) gradually were upregulated at 48h reperfusion, however, anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and BDNF) were downregulated in the relevant IR treatment. IR injury induced CHOP protein appearance with maximum expression at 24h of reperfusion. To test further whether ubiquitination was involved in IR stress, both mono- and poly-ubiquitin levels in IR stress condition were examined, which showed that both mono- and poly-ubiquitin expression significantly impaired. These results provide evidences of UCH-L1/ubiquitination signaling to the testis IR injury in vivo.", "The parvocellular subnuclei of the PVN received an intense NPY- and ACTH-IR innervation. At the light microscopic level, these peptidergic axons were associated with the dendrites and perikarya of CRF-IR neurons. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that NPY- and ACTH-IR axons established synaptic specializations with parvocellular neurons expressing CRF-immunoreactivity.", "Mutations which compromise IR autophosphorylation in vivo result in a decrease of the insulin-activated uptake of 2-deoxyglucose. These results are consistent with previous results which implicate IR autophosphorylation in the generation of the insulin response by cells. To further explore the specificity of the IR tyrosine phosphokinase (TPK) domain in IR function, we have altered the human IR (hIR) cDNA to encode truncated insulin-independent TPKs, which are expressed in chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as either membrane-anchored or cytosolic proteins. Both mutant hIRs exhibit TPK activity in vitro, although the cytosolic form is approximately 20 times more active. The carbohydrate moiety of the membrane-anchored form is of the high mannose type, consistent with an intracellular localization for this mutant hIR. The two mutant hIRs mediate very different physiological responses in transfected cells: the membrane-anchored, but not the cytosolic, hIR TPK mediates a constitutively elevated (135% the maximum insulin-stimulated response in CHO cells) insulin-independent uptake of 2-deoxyglucose. These results thus suggest that the hIR TPK is in fact specific for this aspect of IR function and, when membrane-associated, can mediate the insulin-independent uptake of 2-deoxyglucose. Neither of these mutant hIRs appears to transform CHO cells.", "Other pro-opiomelanocortin IR-peptide are secreted concomitantly in equimolar amounts. Plasma IR-cortisol concentration tends to follow that of ACTH, but also reflects cortisol's longer circulating half-life and the fact that acutely the maximally-stimulating plasma IR-ACTH level is about 45 pg/ml. Sex and age have no effect on the plasma IR-ACTH and IR-cortisol responses to oCRH. The time of day of oCRH administration has little influence on the plasma IR-ACTH response, but the plasma IR-cortisol response is much greater to oCRH given later in the day than early in the morning. Plasma IR-ACTH response to oCRH is more dependent on the basal plasma IR-cortisol level than the time of day. Arginine vasopressin given at the same time as oCRH potentiates 4-fold the plasma IR-ACTH response to oCRH alone, almost to levels obtained with insulin-induced hypoglycemia. However, oCRH administered at the onset of insulin-induced hypoglycemia does not cause higher plasma IR-ACTH levels, indicating that endogenous CRH levels are maximally-stimulating during the hypoglycemic response.", "This protein (designated AchIRPTK) was immunoprecipitated by three monoclonal antibodies, each of which recognizes a distinct antigenic site of the IR cytoplasmic domain and requires the native structure of the protein for recognition and one of which binds at or near the physiologically relevant site(s) of IR autophosphorylation. In vivo, AchIRPTK was phosphorylated on both tyrosine and serine residues. The expression of an active IR protein-tyrosine kinase molecule in this heterologous cell system provides an efficient experimental method for producing this domain in quantity for enzymatic and structural studies.", "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of simvastatin on retinal neurons and the expression of apoptotic proteins in a rat IR model. Our results suggest that RGC loss induced by retinal IR may be prevented by simvastatin and that the mechanism underlying this process possibly involves an alteration in the apoptotic pathway.", "This study investigated the roles of sphingosine kinase-2 (SK2) in mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation after hepatic IR. Following IR, hepatic SK2 mRNA and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels increased ~25-fold and 3-fold, respectively. Inducible nitric oxide synthase, phosphorylated NF\u03baB-p65, TNF\u03b1 mRNA, and neutrophil infiltration all increased markedly after hepatic IR, and these increases were blunted by SK2 inhibition. SK2 plays an important role in mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation responses, hepatocyte death and survival after hepatic IR and represents a new target for the treatment of IR injury. For example, plasma S1P levels increase during myocardial infarction ( A variety of pathophysiological processes, such as free radical and toxic cytokine formation, onset of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), and inflammation contribute to IR injury to the liver ( Male C57BL/6 (8\u20139 weeks) mice were gavaged with 50 mg/kg of 3-(4-chlorophenyl)adamantine-1-carboxylic acid (pyridine-4-ylmethyl)amide (ABC294640, Apogee Biotechnology Corporation, Hummelstown, PA; see structure in Liver and blood samples were collected at 2 and 6 h after surgery. Necrotic areas were quantified by image analysis of 10 randomly selected fields per liver in slides stained with hematoxylin-eosin in a blinded manner using a IPlab 3.7v software (BD Biosciences, Rockville, MD) ( Mitochondria were isolated from the liver of male Sprague Dawley rats (225\u2013250 g) in 250 mM sucrose, 2 mM K Hepatocytes were isolated from male C57BL/6 mice by collagenase digestion and purified as described ( At 2 h after IR or sham operation, hepatic mitochondrial polarization and cell death were monitored by intravital multiphoton microscopy using Rh123 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and PI, respectively ( Liver tissue was homogenized or hepatocytes were sonicated in ice-cold 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.25 M sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Livers were harvested at 2 or 6 h after IR or sham operation, and Western blotting was performed ( Livers were harvested at 2 h and 6 h after IR. To investigate if SK2 is involved in IR injury, we assessed the effects of ABC294640, a specific SK2 inhibitor that does not affect SK1 and other kinases ( At 120 min after anoxia/reoxygenation, levels of SK2 mRNA were increased approximately 5-fold in hepatocytes ( Because IR increased SK2 expression in cultured cells, we investigated the affects of ABC 294640 on the production of S1P after hepatic IR in mice. As indicated in Because SK2 and S1P increased after hepatic IR, we assessed the effects of ABC294640 on several indicators of liver IR injury. After sham operation, no hepatic histopathological changes were observed ( As another marker of liver injury, apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL ( Prior to ischemia, serum ALT levels were 22 U/L, and increased to ~3200 U/L at 2 h and ~19,000 U/L at 6 h after reperfusion, indicating severe liver injury ( Serum bilirubin was not significantly altered at 2 h after reperfusion, but increased 3-fold at 6 h after reperfusion, confirming poor liver function ( Most importantly, the protection of liver function by ABC294640-treatment resulted in complete protection against death from IR injury. Specifically, all mice survived after sham operation (data not shown); however, only 28% of the vehicle-treated mice survived after IR, with death occurring mainly in the first 36 h ( The MPT plays an important role in hepatic IR injury ( To investigate if mitochondrial depolarization is caused by MPT onset, intravital multiphoton imaging of calcein was performed in livers following IR. Addition of 10\u2013100 \u03bcM S1P ( Since S1P causes swelling of isolated mitochondrial only at high, unphysiological concentrations, we investigated whether inhibition of SK2 blocked the MPT Because inflammation plays important roles in IR injury ( Toxic cytokine, e.g. TNF\u03b1 mRNA increased ~10-fold at 2 h after reperfusion and remained elevated at 6 h ( At 6 h after IR, MPO-positive cells in the liver increased by 9-fold, indicating infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) ( Products of sphingolipid metabolism are important second messengers that regulate a variety of cell processes including cell death, proliferation, motility, differentiation, oncogenesis and inflammation ( The role of SKs in IR injury is controversial. SK expression has been shown to increase in cultured cells exposed to hypoxia ( In this study, we investigated the roles of SK2 in hepatic IR injury using a novel, highly specific SK2 inhibitor, ABC294640 ( In this study, we tested the affects of ABC294640 on hepatic warm IR injury. Our studies showed that SK2 is upregulated and the production of S1P is increased markedly after IR. ABC294640 inhibited this overproduction of S1P in hepatocytes in culture and liver in vivo ( In apparent contrast to the present findings, a recent study shows that repeated injection of S1P decreases hepatic and renal injury after hepatic IR, possibly through activation of S1P Our studies demonstrating a role in regulating the MPT shed considerable light on the mechanism by which SK2 activation leads to IR injury. The MPT leads to the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, failure of oxidative phosphorylation, and onset of necrotic cell death ( Activation of SK results in pro-inflammatory responses ( In vivo, inflammatory responses due to the initial IR insult act to extend and magnify the extent of IR injury. In this study, activation of NF-\u03baB and production of TNF\u03b1 increased dramatically after hepatic IR well before onset of overt necrotic cell death ( In conclusion, inhibition of SK2 by ABC294640 protected against IR-induced MPT onset and inflammation, major events precipitating and extending hepatic cell death after IR. Thus, it is likely that SK2 positively modulates MPT onset and inflammation to promote hepatic IR injury, which selective SK2 inhibition prevents. Accordingly, selective SK2 inhibition by ABC294640 represents a promising new strategy to attenuate hepatic IR injury in clinical settings.", "Here, we have used IR-induced apoptosis of K562 cells as a model to explore a role for IMP-3 in cell survival. Knockdown of IMP-3 with siRNA increased susceptibility of cells to IR-induced apoptosis and led to reduced IGF-II production. Finally, culture of IR-treated cells with recombinant IGF-II partially reversed the effects of IMP-3 knockdown on IR-induced apoptosis. Together, these results indicate that IMP-3 acts in part through the IGF-II pathway to promote cell survival in response to IR. Thus, IMP-3 might serve as a new drug target to increase sensitivity of CML cells or other cancers to IR therapy.", "Gray value measurements and percentage of surface area below (i.e., darker as compared with) the calculated threshold (see below) were used for the assessment of 5-mC IR. As illustrated using the white boxes in Colocalization of 5-mC and DAPI was demonstrated after double immunofluorescence ( Dnmt3a IR was assessed previously in sections from the same mouse brains that were used in the present study. Nuclear IR of 5-mC was observed in cells throughout the hippocampus (see Mean intensity of 5-mC IR ( In the same way ( Previously, we observed, in the same cohort of mice, age-related changes of Dnmt3a IR that were attenuated by CR ( Qualitative and quantitative assessment of 5-mC IR revealed densely-stained hypermethylated regions with nuclear localization, which were more pronounced in brains of 24-month-old animals when compared with 12-month-old mice. The age-related increase in 5-mC IR observed in CD animals was not observed in CR animals, suggesting that CR prevented these age-related alterations. Positive correlation with previously reported Dnmt3a IR analysis showed that the changes in 5-mC IR in CA3 and CA1\u20132 are associated with alterations in Dnmt3a. DNA methylation is a dynamic process subject to environmental influences and the aging process ( Previously, we reported an age-related increase of Dnmt3a IR that was also attenuated by CR ( The age-related increase in 5-mC IR observed in the mouse hippocampus was prevented by CR. While an increase in 5-mC IR was found in 24-month-old CD mice as compared with the 12-month-old animals, CR mice did not show such age-related differences. Such a finding is in line with our previous reports of no effects of SOD1 on brain volumes ( Besides the major strengths and limitations of the study design, as discussed previously ( While the present study focused on relative measures of global 5-mC IR within cells, it would be very attractive to extend these with analyses of methylation profiles of genes using whole-genome interrogation or targeted hypothesis-based approaches. Unfortunately, the current experimental design did not allow the isolation of mRNA, which prevented us from examining whether the changes in 5-mC IR have functional consequences for gene expression. High-magnification images of 5-mC IR. Note: An evident increase in 5-mC IR from 12 to 24 months in CD mice, which is not seen in CR mice. Surface area occupied by 5-mC IR measurements (D\u2013F) were corrected for volume differences.", "m708.2 potently inhibited signal transduction mediated by the interaction of IGF1 or IGF2 with the IGF1R and IGF2 with the IR. The mixtures were added to 5\u00d710 Measurement of IGF1R and IR posphorylation was performed as previously described [ Cell growth and inhibition were measured as previously described [ To develop human mAbs against human IGF1, we used a large size (~ 10 Two rounds of panning of the light chain shuffled library (containing 2\u00d710 To further increase the affinity of m708.2, it was converted to a scFv and randomly mutagenized by error-prone PCR. To find whether m708.5 inhibits binding of IGF1 and IGF2 to IGF1R and IR, we used the breast cancer cell line MCF-7, which have been shown to express both receptors. After 3 days of treatment, the cell growth was almost completely inhibited at 320 nM of m708.5 ( The IGF signaling system plays an important role in tumorigenesis [ The inhibitory activity of the antibodies was cell type dependent (data not shown) with a likely major determinant being the surface concentration of the IGF1R and the IR. To date, many IGF1R-specific antibodies have been under preclinical studies, and several are being evaluated in clinical trials [ m708.5 is fully human mAb cross-reactive to both human IGF1 and IGF2 with picomolar affinity and potently inhibits signal transduction mediated by IGF1,2 interacting with IGF1R and IGF2 interacting with IR. The phosphorylated IR was detected with a phospho-tyrosine specific antibody. The total amount of IR was detected.", "Forty-eight male adult SD rats were randomized into 6 equal groups, including a sham-operated group, an IR group, 3 IR+simvastatin groups with intragastric administration of 1, 5, or 10 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7d(-1) for 3 days, and a simvastatin control group treated with 10 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7d(-1) simvastatin. IR of the hind limbs was induced in the 4 IR groups by occlusion of bilateral femoral arteries for 2 h followed by a 3-h reperfusion. Alveolar edema, localized pulmonary atelectasis and large amount of PMN infiltration were found in IR group, and these changes were ameliorated in the 3 simvastatin groups (S(1), S(5), S(10)). Lung W/D, MPO activity and PMN counting were significantly increased in IR group as compared with the sham-operated group (P<0.01). Lung W/D, MPO activity and PMN counting were significantly lowered in the 3 simvastatin groups as compared with IR group (P<0.01). IR-induced decrease in PaO(2) was significantly increased in the 3 simvastatin groups (P<0.01), which also showed significantly lowered expressions of NF-\u03baB p65mRNA and ICAM-1 protein in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.01). Simvastatin attenuates lung injury induced by IR of the hind limbs in rats by suppressing the activation of NF-\u03baB and subsequent accumulation of neutrophils mediated by ICAM-1.", "This study investigated whether liver proliferation could be stimulated in low-dose irradiated liver by partial liver IR injury with high dose radiation. The observation time was 0 day (before IR), 30, 60, 90, and 120 days after IR. Our results showed that serum HGF and hepatocyte HGF mRNA increased after IR with HGF mRNA peak on day 30 in the shielded and low-dose irradiated left-half livers, and their values increased as the dose increased to the left-half liver. MI increased after IR, with the peak noted on day 60 in the shielded and on day 90 in the low-dose irradiated left-half livers. In conclusion, 25 Gy partial liver IR injury could stimulate the shielded liver and low-dose irradiated liver to proliferate. However, IR delayed hepatocyte mitosis.", "", "We have also demonstrated that destabilization of p53 is a key feature in this process [ To confirm the differential effect of forskolin on IR-treated Reh cells and MOPC315 cells, the effect of elevating cAMP on p53 expression was analyzed. BCP-ALL: B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia; cAMP: Cyclic adenosine monophosphate; IR: Ionizing radiation; MOPC: Mineral Oil-induced Plasmacytoma; MM: Multiple myeloma; PDE: phosphodiesterases; PGE2: prostaglandin E2; PKA: Protein kinase A; PI: Propidium Iodide; TUNEL: TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; 8CPT-cAMP: 8-chlorophenylthio-cAMP.", "We aimed to investigate circulating vaspin levels in subjects with NASH and also to search for the association of vaspin with IR, adiponectin, and histological findings. Insulin sensitivity determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) index. However, in multivariate analysis adjusted for glucose and lipid parameters, and HOMA-IR indexes, the difference in vaspin concentrations was disappeared.", "Cg and EGCg decreased phosphorylation of PKC\u03bb/\u03b6 in the presence of insulin without affecting insulin-induced phosphorylation of IR, and Akt.", "Although skin is not a classical insulin target tissue, both insulin and IGF-1 have been shown to be potent stimulants of normal KC migration and proliferation through activation of IR and IGF-1R ( Ganglioside GM3 has been suggested to play an intermediary role in the development of insulin resistance and diabetes. Keratinocytes from GM3S knockout mice have activated IR and IGF-1R signaling and, as a result, accelerated migration and proliferation, particularly in the presence of excess glucose. Human diabetic foot skin had a 4.1-fold increase in GM3S mRNA expression in comparison with age- and site-matched controls ( To explore the effect of GM3S expression on wound healing To more closely simulate human wound healing and reduce mouse skin contraction, we used a silicone splinted wound healing model ( Pre-incubation of WT primary mouse KCs in 20 mM glucose for 72 h, traditionally used to simulate the hyperglycemic diabetic environment GM3S depletion dramatically increased IR and IGF-1R phosphorylation and downstream activation, as shown in p-IGF-1R was 2.5-fold greater in normoglycemic medium after insulin stimulation and 1.9-fold greater after IGF-1 stimulation in GM3S-deficient vs. WT cells ( In KCs, activation of IR or IGF-1R promotes their association with insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) ( Glucose supplementation to WT cells decreased IRS-1 co-immunoprecipitation with IR in the presence of ligands by approximately 60% ( Increased glucose inhibited insulin- and IGF-1-induced p-IRS-1 in WT cells by 100% and 20%, respectively ( Finally, we addressed the relative importance of IR vs. IGF-1R activation in stimulating GM3S Despite intriguing evidence that GM3 is a key intermediary in the development of insulin resistance in canonical insulin target tissues, the effect of GM3 depletion on peripheral tissues and diabetic wound healing has never been explored. Furthermore, these observations suggest a central role for KC GM3 in the wound healing defect of obesity-related diabetes (see schematic, In ganglioside-depleted adipocytes, the resultant increase in insulin sensitivity has been linked to adipocyte IR activation ( Gangliosides are thought to impact signaling primarily at the membrane level through regulating interactions of lipid raft components ( Human diabetic and age-matched volunteer control plantar foot skin was obtained after written Northwestern IRB-approved informed patient consent according to Declaration of Helsinki guidelines; adipose tissue was removed prior to analyses. Phosphorylation of IR ( (", "To assess IR-induced resection at two-ended DSBs, we used fluorescence activated cell-sorting (FACS) to quantify chromatin-bound RPA in G2 phase ( X-ray induced DSB repair monitored by enumerating \u03b3H2AX foci loss occurs with two-component kinetics in G2-phase ( CtIP siRNA prevents HR in G2 cells but repair can proceed by NHEJ ( Our data suggests that MRE11 endonuclease initiates resection, and functions upstream of MRE11 exonuclease activity. 4 \u03bcM APH was added 10 min before IR. Medium was refreshed 12 h post IR, and cells were incubated with 4 \u03bcM APH, 0.1 mg/mL Colcemid and 600 \u03bcM UCN-01, which abolishes G2/M checkpoint arrest, 12\u201316 h post-IR to collect irradiated G2 cells in mitosis. To examine IR-induced foci in G2 cells ( 1 x 10 UV-microbeams were performed as described ( All data were derived from 3\u20134 independent experiments unless stated. Analysis using MRN in place of MRE11 is shown in (A) MRE11 inhibitors reduce chromatin-bound RPA levels post IR. IR-induced RPA retention in A549 cells were monitored by FACS-analysis at 2 h post 10 Gy IR. Inhibitors were added 30 min before IR. (C) A defect in IR-induced RAD51 foci formation was confirmed in the presence of double inhibitor treated 1BR3 (WT) hTERT cells. (E) HR and NHEJ repair frequency following single or combined endo- and exo-inhibitor treatment was measured by the U2OS DR-GFP (HR) or H1299 dA3 (NHEJ) assay as described in (A) ATLD2 cells show significantly reduced MRN levels, causing impaired IR-induced ATM activation and downstream signaling. (B) Depletion of KAP-1 alleviates the DSB repair defect in ATLD2 cells, consolidating that the repair defect is caused by impaired chromatin modification (see also (A) MRE11 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease and EXO1/BLM 5\u2032-3\u2032, which digest in opposite directions, both contribute to IR-induced RPA foci formation.", "It is most likely that multiple pathways are involved in IR-induced apoptosis in rat myocardium cells. Bcl-2 overexpression might prevent IR-induced apoptosis by inhibiting cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and block activation of caspase-3.", "RIPC applied to the opposite arm in 5 min IR intervals prevented reductions in flow mediated dilation when applied immediately, 24h or 48h before the more prolonged IR, but not 4h before IR [ The clinical implication of these studies is that IPC, or at least RIPC, permits for two windows where protection can be delivered assuming foreknowledge of the ischemic event. This may be relevant in preventing possible brain IR injury that can be anticipated such as in surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass or carotid endarterectomies.", "In this study, we investigated the possible mechanism of impaired NO production and IR during hypoxia in a mouse model. Mice were exposed to hypoxia for different periods of time (0-24 h), and parameters of IR and endothelial dysfunctions were analyzed. Exposure to hypoxia resulted in a time-dependent increase in IR as well as multimeric forms of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and subsequently a decrease in eNOS activity. In contrast, preincubation of vWF-immunodepleted plasma failed to inhibit insulin-induced NO production, whereas vWF immunoneutralization abolished the effect of hypoxia-induced IR and D-[U-(14)C]glucose uptake. These results indicated that vWF, an antagonist of eNOS, inhibits insulin-induced NO production and causes IR.", "However, this strategy is not sufficiently effective to prevent preservation injury of the tissue [ Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) induced by IR injury contributes to the development of delayed graft function (DGF), which remains an important complication of kidney transplantation and, despite advances in cold storage, is a major risk factor for acute rejection and long-term kidney allograft dysfunction [ The nuclear protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a 116 kDa protein member of PARP enzyme family comprised of three functional domains. The amino-terminal DNA-binding domain contains two zinc fingers that are important for the binding of PARP-1 to single-strand breaks and double-strand breaks [ The objective of the present study in mice was to test the hypothesis that PARP inhibition can reduce ATN and other renal lesions associated with prolonged cold IR in kidneys preserved in UW solution, thereby improving the structural preservation of renal grafts. DPQ at 24 h before IR significantly reduced tubular PARP-1 expression, tubular injury (ATN and vacuolization), and the number of animals affected. Kidneys from DPQ-treated animals preserved in UW solution plus DPQ evidenced a greater reduction in PARP-1 expression and tubular injury, finding no significant differences with their respective controls ( The absence of PARP-1 significantly reduced IR-induced tubular lesions, finding scant histopathological alterations and no significant differences with the changes observed in control kidneys ( The main finding of this study was that the administration of PARP inhibitor DPQ to kidneys and its addition to the UW solution in which they are cold-stored attenuated ATN and other IR-related lesions. After cellular exposure to genotoxic agents in IR injury, the genome integrity of PARP is maintained, but extensive DNA damage may lead to excessive PARP activation, which consumes large quantities of cellular NAD, producing ATP depletion and cell death [ Tissue ischemia and reperfusion result in activation of the nuclear enzyme PARP. Early investigations demonstrated that chemically distinct inhibitors of PARP activity such as benzamides and isoquinolinones can reduce the degree of injury associated with IR of different organs [ Isoquinolinones such as DPQ, 1,5-DHIQ [1,5-dihydroxyisoquinoline (5-hydroxyisoquinolin-1(2H)-one)], PJ-34 (phenanthridinone-based PARP inhibitor), INO-1001 (indeno isoquinolinone), and FR247304 are potent PARP inhibitors [ The lesions observed in this murine IR model correspond to incipient ATN alterations. Protein ribosylation was increased in IR kidneys immersed for 48 h at 4\u00b0C in UW without DPQ PARP-1 inhibitor; this increase was smaller in subgroups without pretreatment (line 8, group 2) and smallest in IR kidneys immersed for 48 h at 4\u00b0C in UW with DPQ supplementation (line 8, group 1). Morphological and immunohistochemical comparison between control and IR C57BL/6 kidney mice samples.", "Our study challenges the notion that IR is mediated to a significant degree by changes in plasma FFA concentration. Obesity often causes IR and has been shown to influence the severity of IR in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) It has been demonstrated that bariatric surgery can achieve excellent long-term weight loss and improve obesity-related comorbidities, quality of life, and survival Patients undergoing bariatric surgery have been also shown to have decreased FFA levels one-year after operation The aim of our study is to determine if a postoperative decrease in FFA correlates with the improved Si seen in T2DM patients undergoing LRYGB. This correlation underlines the crucial role played by the fat tissue in both the pathogenesis of the obesity-related IR and its resolution after LRYGB, and justifies the relatively recent concept of fat tissue as an endocrine organ Other limitations of our study were that we didn't collect data showing the duration of the diabetes prior the enrollment and that we did not perform an insulin suppression test in our obese patients in order to quantify the insulin resistance. However, these data suggest that other factors produced by AT, such as adipokines, might play an important role in mediating obesity-related IR. Therefore, we believe that changes in adiposity, and consequently changes in adipokines, such proinflammatory cytokines, leptin, adiponectin and resistin, are likely the key players in determining remission of IR and type 2 diabetes after LRYGB.", "Rats were treated with Mino prior to and following IR. Cellular inflammation was quantified by flow-cytometric evaluation of retinal tissue using the myeloid marker CD11b and leukocyte common antigen CD45 to differentiate and quantify CD11b Mino treatment significantly inhibited IR-induced retinal vascular permeability and disruption of tight junction organization. Retinal IR injury significantly altered mRNA expression for 21 of 25 inflammation- and gliosis-related genes examined. Of these, Mino treatment effectively attenuated IR-induced expression of lipocalin 2 (LCN2), serpin peptidase inhibitor clade A member 3 N (SERPINA3N), TNF receptor superfamily member 12A (TNFRSF12A), monocyte chemoattractant-1 (MCP-1, CCL2) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). A marked increase in leukostasis of both myeloid leukocytes and lymphocytes was observed following IR. Mino treatment significantly reduced retinal leukocyte numbers following IR and was particularly effective in decreasing the appearance of MHCII IR induces a retinal neuroinflammation within hours of reperfusion characterized by inflammatory gene expression, leukocyte adhesion and invasion, and vascular permeability. The model employs an ischemic period, typically ranging from 45 min up to 120 min, followed by natural reperfusion that leads to neurodegeneration (for review see [ Recently it has been recognized that the IR model also recapitulates changes in the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) and retinal capillary degeneration observed in diabetic retinopathy and vein occlusions. Using optical coherence tomography (OCT), Kim and co-workers [ Much less is known about the inflammatory response to retinal IR injury. Several studies have documented an induction of pro-inflammatory genes in rodent retinas following IR, including intracellular adhesion molecule ICAM-1 and chemoattractants such as CCL2 [ Minocycline is a blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) permeable tetracycline derivative that exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and antioxidant properties, and which inhibits neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (CNS) (for recent reviews see [ Male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Accumulative blood-retinal barrier leakages were measured using the Evans blue dye method of Xu and co-workers [ Eyes were removed, punctured and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature (RT) before dissecting retinas. Total RNA was purified from retinal tissues using RNeasy Plus\u2122 Mini kit (Qiagen, Retinas were removed by orbital dissection and IR and sham retinas pooled (2 to 4 retinas per group). Pelleted tissues were resuspended in a total of 500 \u03bcL of Hepes-buffered saline (HBSS) with 0.5 mg/ml of Liberase enzyme mix (TM research grade, Roche Applied Science, Caspase-3 (DEVDase) activity was measured in retinal homogenates using the fluorometric CaspACE assay system (Promega, Using a rat model of IR injury caused by 45 min of ischemia, we previously demonstrated that both retinal neurodegeneration and increased vascular permeability occurs at 4 h to 48 h following IR [ ZO-1 represents a central organizing protein in the junction complex comprising the BRB [ To examine the effect of Mino treatment on the inflammatory response following IR we used qRT-PCR analysis to examine the expression levels of 25 mRNAs at 48 h following IR in rats systemically treated with or without Mino as described above. The mRNAs examined were chosen from a previously obtained transcriptomics data set for this rat IR model [ Comparing mRNA levels in sham-treated eyes from rats treated with and without Mino revealed that drug treatment alone significantly affected the expression of five mRNAs, including IL6 (increased 2.5-fold, Given that Mino reduced the overall transcriptional pro-inflammatory response to IR and significantly inhibited the induction of expression of the monocyte chemoattractant CCL2 as well as the leukocyte adhesion molecule ICAM-1, we hypothesized that Mino treatment inhibits the attraction, vascular adherence and invasion of monocytes to retinal tissue following IR, thus leading to a diminished cellular inflammation. Figure Next we used flow cytometry to quantify and better characterize this leukostasis response, as well as to test the effects of Mino treatment on this cellular inflammation at 48 h following IR (Figure Consistent with the IF results, the relative numbers of all CD45-positive leukocytes were markedly increased by IR. This was due to significant increases ( Mino treatment significantly inhibited the increase in both myeloid leukocytes and lymphocytes following IR (Figure To test the effect of Mino treatment on retinal cell death at 48 h following IR the previously established [ Mino reduced IR-induced neuroinflammation, including the expression of inflammatory genes and leukostasis, and prevented IR-induced permeability and tight junction disorganization. To the best of our knowledge the present study is the first to examine the effects of Mino on vascular permeability and cellular inflammation following retinal IR. Chen and coworkers [ The lack of neuroprotection by Mino observed in the present study is surprising because Mino is well known as a neuroprotective agent (reviewed in [ It is possible that Mino\u2019s ability to inhibit inflammation and inflammatory cell attraction may reduce leakage at 24 to 48 h after IR by averting endothelial damage caused by adherent or invading leukocytes. Such evidence was presented by Hirata and co-workers [ IR induced neuroinflammation that was inhibited by Mino treatment. We developed a set of 25 mRNA markers to monitor the inflammatory and astrogliosis responses of the retina to IR injury. The responses at 48 h following IR were very different from those observed after intravitreal injection of LPS, which represents a classical inflammatory insult mediated by activation of toll like receptor 4 (TLR4). The expressions of mRNAs corresponding to genes associated with classical inflammation (ICAM-1, CCL2, IL6, IL1B, TNF and CXCL2) were significantly increased in IR. However, the induction of these mRNAs by IR was dwarfed by the induction observed following intravitreal LPS injection. Several studies have documented induction of classical pro-inflammatory genes, including NOS2, COX2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6, in rodent retinas within hours of IR [ Mino significantly inhibited the increase in expression of CCL2 and ICAM1 mRNAs. Retinal IR injury upregulates both P-selectin and ICAM1 expression, presumably leading to increased leukocyte rolling and adhesion on the endothelial lumen [ Flow cytometric quantification of CD11b and CD45 leukocyte markers was used to quantify the accumulation of immune cells in the retina following IR. MHCII can also be expressed by activated T-cells [ The molecular mechanism by which Mino may act to reduce inflammation and vascular permeability following IR is uncertain. The retinal IR injury model has primarily been used to explore means to prevent the neurodegenerative response triggered by a transient ischemic insult, but it also provides a useful means to explore the prevention of vascular and inflammatory responses to injury. The molecular mechanisms by which Mino mediated the inflammatory and vascular responses to IR were not identified, but we can reasonably conclude that this was not the result of reducing the extent of neuronal damage caused by IR. Further studies are needed to determine the extent to which inflammatory gene expression and/or leukostasis following IR causes vascular dysfunction and leakage, perhaps by damaging the endothelium. Our data suggest that there is also a direct effect of IR on endothelial tight junction organization.

Each animal in the treatment group was injected with 640 ng of Mino at 4 h prior to IR and 1 h after reperfusion. Evans blue dye was injected 15 min after IR and circulated for 2 h prior to flushing and removal of retinas.", "Subsequently, on 15 Group 2: IR control (n=15) Rats were administered normal saline orally (3mL/kg/day) for a period of 14 days. Subsequently, on 15 Groups 3-5: Naringin 20 + IR (n=15), Naringin 40 + IR (n=15) and Naringin 80 + IR (n=15) Rats were administered naringin (20, 40and 80 mg/kg/day, p.o., respectively) for a period of 14 days.

Our results identify naringin as a cardioprotective agent as it reduced myocardial infarct size; preserved myocyte structural integrity and decreased LVEDP and tended to improve \u00b1LVdP/ In our study, myocardial IR injury was produced by occluding LAD coronary artery for 45 min and subsequent 60 min reperfusion. Our findings as well as previous studies have demonstrated that global ischemia followed by reperfusion in rat hearts is associated with depressed contractile function and increased preload as reflected by decreased MAP, HR, (\u00b1) LVdP/ Myocardial IR injury may intensify pathological processes that contribute to ROS generation, disturbances in cation homeostasis, and depletion of cellular energy stores, which may eventually result in myocardial necrosis and dysfunction. Substantial evidences suggest that ROS-induced oxidative stress is considered a major causative factor in the pathogenesis of myocardial IR injury [ Substantial literature suggests that molecular chaperones such as the Hsp27 and 70 actively participate in an array of cellular processes by mediating protein folding and transport, preventing protein aggregation, denaturation and degradation as well as promoting damaged protein elimination [ It has been reported that the progression of IR injury is characterized by an inflammatory response in which increased TNF-\u03b1 production and/or IKK-\u03b2/NF-\u03baB activation along with neutrophil and monocyte/macrophage infiltration play an important role. In IR hearts, activated neutrophils release ROS and proteases, and activated monocytes/macrophages discharge inflammatory cytokines which further trigger TNF-\u03b1/IKK-\u03b2/NF-\u03baB signaling. It regulates systemic blood pressure, left ventricular function, vascular remodeling, angiogenesis, reduces calcium overload, ROS production, apoptosis and neutrophil-associated injury in IR heart [ MAPKs are multifunctional regulators that play a key role in a number of biological processes in heart including cell proliferation, survival, apoptosis, actin reorganization and cytokine production [ Previous studies have shown that IR results in substantial induction of apoptosis, and susceptibility to cardiac dysfunction depends on the degree of myocyte apoptosis [ Subsequent to IR challenge, CK-MB and LDH released from damaged myocytes enter the circulation. Thus, leakage of these enzymes provides substantial evidence of sarcolemmal integrity disruption [ In conclusion, our present work demonstrates that naringin may serve as a promising cardioprotective agent, which could effectively protect the myocardium against IR-induced myocardial damage and could be used as add on therapy in patients for the secondary prevention of post myocardial infarction or for the primary prevention in patients who are having multiple risk factors like family history of early coronary artery disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes [ The authors gratefully acknowledge Mr. BM Sharma for his technical assistance during the course of the surgery and in the preparation of histopathological slides.", "The initial processing of the DSB ends is a key determinant of DSB repair pathway choice and is tightly regulated during the cell cycle ( 53BP1 does not block MRN functions, exonuclease 1, RPA or RAD51, but has an antagonistic relationship with BRCA1 ( Non-homologous end joining repair of DSBs in G 53BP1 has no known catalytic activity, but acts, instead, as an adaptor/mediator for DNA damage signaling and responds to IR-induced DNA damage by redistributing to DSB sites to form discrete nuclear foci ( RIF1, a highly conserved protein present from yeast to mammals, was originally discovered in budding yeast as a protein that associates with the telomeric DNA-binding protein Rap1 and negatively regulates telomere length ( RIF1 and 53BP1 act in the same DNA damage response pathway to promote DSB repair ( Non-homologous end joining is important not only for the DSB repair but also for rejoining of the DNA ends generated during V(D)J recombination of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor loci, which occurs specifically during Band T-cell differentiation ( An inherited NHEJ defect was identified in fibroblasts isolated from a patient with a novel severe combined immunodeficiency that displayed high sensitivity to IR and defective V(D)J recombination ( Recent studies have made considerable advances in understanding the role of 53BP1 in regulating DSBs repair, specifically in the identification of key DNA repair factors that enhance or block the recruitment of factors at the DSB sites to facilitate DSB repair pathway selection.", "The The \u03b3H2AX response of myeloblasts post-IR of individual patients was compared to CD34+ controls and categorized phenotypically based on comparisons of mean \u03b3H2AX values at baseline, 0.5 and 4 hours with the Student\u2019s t-test (GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA) (see Thirty t-AML patients were chosen for study based on the availability of paired bone marrow (tumor) and skin (normal) DNA samples.

The aim of this study was to directly assess IHL and IMCL in AGHDs by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and to evaluate the association of lipid levels with IR. Homeostasis model assessment of IR was significantly correlated with IHL (r = 0.896, p = 0.0001) and IMCL (r = 0.749, p = 0.0102), but not with the VFA or percent truncal fat mass.

The survival fraction, expressed as a function of IR, was estimated according to the following formula: Survival fraction = Colonies formed/(Cells seeded \u00d7 Plating efficiency of the control group/100). Cells were plated, subjected to IR, and collected at different time points. After MSI1 knockdown, cells were treated with 5 Gy IR. Thirty minutes after IR, cells were fixed and permeabilized. Initially, to determine the impact of IR on MSI1 expression, U251 glioblastoma cells were treated with a single dose of IR (5 Gy). To determine the survival rate after IR, U251 shMSI1 and shCtrl cells were treated with different doses of IR and evaluated in a clonogenic assay. MSI1 knockdown cells (A) showed increased sensitivity to IR (B). Finally, we evaluated IR-induced DNA damage levels in MSI1-silenced and control cells by measuring levels of 53BP1 foci, an established marker of double-strand breaks. Then, MSI1-knockout glioblastoma lines were transfected with vectors containing empty control, MSI1, or DNA-PKcs coding sequence, subjected to a single dose of IR (2.5 Gy), and evaluated in clonogenic assays. These results suggest the association of MSI1 expression with lowering levels of DNA damage caused by IR and its role in the double-strand break repair, most likely by regulating DNA-PKcs expression and activity. Using a DNA-PK kinase assay and assessing the phosphorylation status of replication protein A 2, a previous study demonstrated IR-induced DNA-PK activity in glioblastoma cell lines.", "Expressed Lnk underwent coimmunoprecipitation tests with green fluorescent protein-labeled insulin receptor and His-tagged insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), and their colocalization in HEK293T cells was examined.

Lnk was coimmunoprecipitated with insulin receptor and IRS1. Lnk and insulin receptor/IRS1 locations overlapped around the nucleus. IR, protein kinase B (Akt), and ERK1/2 activities were inhibited by Lnk overexpression and inhibited further after insulin stimulation, whereas IRS1 serine activity was increased. Insulin receptor (Tyr1150/1151), Akt (Thr308), and ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) phosphorylation was decreased, whereas IRS1 (Ser307) phosphorylation was increased with Lnk overexpression.

Saliva and submandibular gland tissues were obtained for biochemical, morphological (hematoxylin and eosin staining and Masson\u2019s trichrome), and Western blot analysis at 8 hours, 24 hours, and 4 weeks after head and neck IR. IR caused a significant reduction of salivary secretion and amylase activity but elevation of malondialdehyde. Mice were treated with 10 mg/kg SIM via intraperitoneal (IP) injection every 2 days beginning 1 week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday) before IR and continuing up to the end of the experiment. Particularly, SIM was given 30 minutes before IR on the first Sunday. Saliva and submandibular gland (SMG) tissues were obtained for biochemical, morphological, and Western blot analysis at 8 hours, 24 hours, and 4 weeks after localized IR of the head and neck. Prior to IR, mice were anesthetized by an IP injection of 50 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital. Then, the mice were placed in a plastic tube holding them firmly in a supine position during IR. During the IR procedure, the rest of the body was shielded by a 12-mm-thick lead shield positioned on the chest and abdomen. Saliva was collected in preweighed ice-cooled microfuge tubes 8 hours, 24 hours, and 4 weeks after IR.

We treated HeLa cells with IR and the OGA inhibitor PUGNAc to induce DNA damage and suppress the degradation of O-GlcNAcylation. Compared to the mock treated cells, the OGT-depleted cells were hypersensitive to low doses of IR (Figure In this study, we have demonstrated that OGT-dependent O-GlcNAcylation is enriched at the sites of DNA damage and negatively regulates DNA damage response. With IR treatment, we found that both H2AX and MDC1 were O-GlcNAcylated by OGT.

This paper proposes a novel target detection method by decision-level SAR and IR fusion using an Adaboost-based machine learning scheme to achieve a high detection rate and low false alarm rate. This paper presents a single framework of a SAR and IR target detection method using modified Boolean map visual theory (modBMVT) and feature-selection based fusion. Previous methods applied different algorithms to detect SAR and IR targets because of the different physical image characteristics. One method that is optimized for IR target detection produces unsuccessful results in SAR target detection. This study examined the image characteristics and proposed a unified SAR and IR target detection method by inserting a median local average filter (MLAF, pre-filter) and an asymmetric morphological closing filter (AMCF, post-filter) into the BMVT. Heterogeneous SAR and IR images were registered automatically using the proposed RANdom SAmple Region Consensus (RANSARC)-based homography optimization after a brute-force correspondence search using the detected target centers and regions. The proposed method showed good SAR and IR target detection performance through feature selection-based decision fusion on a synthetic database generated by OKTAL-SE. Automatic target detection (ATD) is very important in military applications and there are challenging problems with ground surveillance [ Targets in inaccessible areas can be detected by either the SAR sensor or IR sensor. In contrast, IR can provide thermal information and relatively informative shape information of the targets, despite being affected by the weather conditions, such as rain and fog [ In general, the fusion of SAR and IR sensors for target detection can be described by the level at which the data is combined [ On the other hand, there are more studies related to single sensor-based ground target detection. In the case of the IR sensor-based target detection, a variety of filtering schemes, such as spatial filtering and spatio-temporal filtering have been proposed depending on the target motion and background clutter types [ In the case of SAR sensor-based target detection, a range of methods have been deployed, such as genetic programming [ In general, sensor-dependent, specific target detection algorithms show good target detection performance. That is, the SAR sensor requires a proper scatter noise reduction method and the IR sensor requires proper modeling of the thermal targets. On the other hand, it is more efficient to use a single algorithm for SAR- and IR-fusion based target detection. Although a unified algorithm is ideally suitable, actual applications have shown disappointing results, as illustrated in Based on these motivations, this paper proposes a single detection method to detect both SAR and IR targets simultaneously for a SAR and IR fusion study. Many small IR target detectors are available, as mentioned above. In particular, the Boolean Map Visual Theory (BMVT)-based detector shows outperforming results for small IR target detection in a cluttered environment [ In an intensity channel, the original format of an input image (12 bits or 14 bits) is changed to a 8 bit gray scale image ( An intensity interval is normally selected as 4 considering the computational complexity. An intensity fused Boolean map ( In an orientation channel, directional derivative feature maps ( The proposed fusion-based target detection consists of modified BMVT-based basic detection block, automatic SAR/IR registration block, and logical fusion block, as shown in As mentioned in the previous section, the original BMVT-based target detection has two problems if the method is applied to extended SAR/IR target detection. The first is that it generates many false detections due to thermal noise in the IR images and scattering noise in the SAR images. This paper proposes a novel median local average filter (MLAF), which is a hybrid version of the mean and median filters, to remove heterogeneous noise from IR and SAR images, as expressed in Equation ( Pixels in the filtering region (size The second problem can be solved by attaching a morphological closing filter after the BMVT detector. In this study, an asymmetric morphological closing filter (AMCF) was applied to the binarized enhanced map ( The binary enhanced map is dilated (\u2295) with Aligning or registering the SAR and IR images is important for detecting the targets by sensor fusion. A direct pixel matching-based registration approach is impractical because the SAR and IR images have different physical characteristics and imaging geometries (SAR: slanted viewing direction; IR: top-down viewing direction). In this paper, a novel SAR and IR registration scheme was applied, as shown in As shown in This paper proposes a brute-force search and consensus matching method to find the initial image homography ( The next step is to calculate the image homogrphy for each matching combination [ This process continues until the maximum score is achieved. The final targets can be detected by SAR and IR detection fusion given the SAR and IR detection and registration information. The attribute features of the SAR and IR target, such as the filtered intensity and target area, are extracted using individual detection information generated by SAR and IR sensors. If The study investigated two kinds of feature selection methods using the Laplacian support vector machine (LapSVM) and Adaboost [ In SAR and IR fusion-based target detection and recognition, the most difficult part is how to prepare the SAR and IR database (DB) for the same target and background environments to validate a range of detection algorithms. In this paper, the basic assumption is that only standing or non-moving vehicles are considered to prevent the misplacement of moving targets during SAR and IR image acquisition. Although IR cameras are usually static sensors, i.e., they acquire one image at one point in time, SAR sensors are by their very nature kinematic devices, which need to integrate high-frequent measurements over time to produce an image. According this survey, there is no public SAR/IR database due to security reasons. The first database acquisition strategy is to use a real IR camera and SAR sensor mounted on an airplane. The second strategy is to use satellites, such as TerraSAR-X for SAR and KOMSAT-3A for IR. On the other hand, identifying the various military target images for both SAR and IR sensors is also very difficult and expensive. The third method is to develop a SAR and IR simulator for DB generation, which is out of the current research scope and will require a long time for development. The final strategy is to purchase commercially available software that can synthesize both SAR and IR images for the same scenario. Several simulators that can work on a specific spectrum are available: DIRSIG and SensorVision for IR and Xpatch for radar. The only simulator that can generate both SAR and IR images is OKTAL-SE, which is a proven synthesizing tool [ The following parameters were used to make a DB for target detection purposes. The pre-filter, called the Median Local Average Filter (MLAF), can remove both thermal and scattering noise in an IR and SAR image. The noise removal capability was compared quantitatively in terms of the signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) defined in Equation ( The post-filter, which is called the asymmetric morphological closing filter (AMCF), is used to reduce the partitioned detection pixels in the extended SAR and IR detection. SAR and IR image registration is required to detect the final targets. Because SAR and IR images have completely different characteristics, it is difficult to find the corresponding points to estimate the image homography. This paper proposes a RANSARC method to register heterogeneous SAR and IR images using the target points and target regions. RANSARC can maximize the overlapping ratio between the SAR and IR regions. The proposed method is then applied to backgrounds 1, 2 and 3 to register the SAR and IR images. In `without sensor fusion\u2019 scheme, the modBMVT-based SAR and IR detection method are used. Adaboost is used frequently in face detection or car detection [ In addition, the target detection accuracies were measured by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, as shown in This paper proposed a novel SAR/IR target detection by feature selection-based fusion from candidate targets generated using a modified Boolean map visual theory-based method (modBMVT). This paper attempted to solve several issues encountered in SAR/IR fusion-based target detection research. The most fundamental problem was acquiring the SAR/IR target images. This paper proposes the use of the SAR/IR image generation tool, OKTAL-SE, which can produce SAR and IR images for the same scenario. The second issue is making a suitable SAR/IR target detector that can be effective in both the SAR and IR domain. In this paper, a modified Boolean map visual theory-based SAR/IR detection method was proposed by attaching a pre-filter and post-filter to the conventional BMVT. The pre-filter, called the median local average filter (MLAF), can effectively remove both thermal (in IR image) and scattering noise (in SAR image). The third issue was registering the SAR/IR images automatically. The corresponding points between SAR and IR are very difficult to find because they image completely different physical characteristics. In addition, the proposed method should be applied to real SAR and IR images, which is the most challenging area. Woo-Jin Song and So-Hyun Kim provided SAR/IR database, operational scenario and performed the in-depth discussion of the related literature and confirmed the accuracy experiments that are exclusive to this paper.

Importantly, when FLIP protein levels were downregulated by RNAi, IR-induced cell death was significantly enhanced. The clinically relevant histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors vorinostat and entinostat were subsequently found to sensitize a subset of NSCLC cell lines to IR in a manner that was dependent on their ability to suppress FLIP expression and promote activation of caspase-8. Entinostat also enhanced the antitumor activity of IR in vivo Therefore, FLIP downregulation induced by HDAC inhibitors is a potential clinical strategy to radiosensitize NSCLC and thereby improve response to radiotherapy. Overall, this study provides the first evidence that pharmacological inhibition of FLIP may improve response of NCSLC to IR.", "To sensitize cells to the effects of ROS on senescence, we treated them with 5 Gy, a dose sufficient to induce ~ 10% senescence in each cell line ( Thus, we screened SA- As observed in our initial studies with radiation alone, increases in SA- Examining senescence responses for the full range of compounds with and without IR, distinct patterns were observed for the two cell lines ( Following up on etoposide, we screened seven structurally diverse topoisomerase inhibitors that target topoisomerase II, topoisomerase I, or gyrase for senescence-inducing effects in unirradiated F10 cells. Correlative results between etoposide-induced senescence and LPO raised the hypothesis that DNA damage and LPO signaling might work together to promote senescence, and testing of LPO in senescent cells induced by IR and other topoisomerase inhibitors supported this hypothesis.

BRCA1 level was low in G1 phase, increased when cells enter S phase and reached the maximum in G2 phase, and IR treatment induced phosphorylation of BRCA1 during S and G2 phases, as indicated by mobility shift.", "In this study we aimed to investigate whether crocin and safranal had protective effects on liver IR injury induced in an infrarenal aortic clamping (IRAC) model. Male Wistar-Albino rats (n=32) were divided into four groups with 8 animals each as follows: Sham, IR, IR+crocin, and IR+safranal. The infrarenal aorta (IRA) was clamped for 60min for the ischemic period and allowed to reperfuse for 120min. Plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were found to be significantly higher in the IR group than the sham group (respectively; p=0.015, p<0.001). There were significant differences between the IR group and the IR+crocin group or the IR+safranal group in AST levels (respectively; p=0.02, p<0.001). ALT showed a significant decrease in the IR+crocin group compared to the IR group (p<0.05). Bax and Caspase-3 expression in the IR group was remarkably higher than in the other groups. Caspase-3 and Bax expression in the IR+crocin and the IR+safranal groups were significantly lower than in the IR group. IRAC is a cause of IR injury in the liver. This study showed that crocin and safranal have protective effects on IR induced liver injury.", "G-Re suppresses LPS-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of IRAK-1, and sequentially blocks IKK-\u03b1 phosphorylation, NF-\u03baB activation, and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 LPS-induced inflammatory response is closely associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease (AD), and multiple sclerosis.

G-Rg5 reduces the expression of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, COX-2, and iNOS, and phosphorylation of IRAK-1, IKK-\u03b1, and NF-\u03baB. The degradation of IRAK-1 and IRAK4 are decreased by G-Rg5 in LPS-stimulated alveolar macrophages Inhibitory effects of G-Rg5 in neuroinflammatory responses have also been examined in a memory-impaired rat model induced by streptozotocin (STZ).", "Obesity contributes to systemic IR and its associated metabolic complications. Inflammation at the placenta may contribute to the severity of maternal IR and her likelihood of developing GDM and may also mediate the adverse consequences of obesity and GDM on the fetus. This indicates that exosomes transfer the effects of FA between the muscle cells and this could disrupt homeostasis and lead to IR in muscle cells. ( Similarly, IR in muscle cells was observed after co-incubation with macrophages treated with adipose tissue-derived exosomes ( Although exosomes contained a wide variety of molecules, miRNAs has been the center of attention mainly due to its role in regulating gene expression. The two possible growth mechanisms are hyperplasia and hypertrophy ( Obesity is associated with inflammation, elicited by metabolites which lead to systemic IR. Hypertrophic adipose tissue is associated with excess amount of adiposity and results in a dysregulated secretory profile ( Studies to date are suggesting that the relationship between hypertrophic growth of adipose tissue and inflammation is a pivotal factor that causes IR. Stimulation of HepG2 and C2C12 cells with adipose tissue-derived exosomes caused IR by inhibiting Akt-phosphorylation. Exosomes from adipose tissue are known to regulate the metabolic activity of various cells The IR seen in obesity is maintained by adipose tissue. The dysregulated secretion of bioactive molecules by hypertrophic adipose tissue contributes to the development of IR in obese patients. Besides adipocytokines, the adipose tissue also releases exosomes, which are known to mediate IR and various metabolic disorders associated with obesity. This may further contribute to the systemic inflammation and IR seen in obese GDM pregnancies.

GRK2 phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and represses insulin signaling . Moreover, GRK2 phosphorylates \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) phosphorylation in an insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2)-dependent manner and promotes \u03b22AR desensitization via internalization . further demonstrated that hyperinsulinemia in mouse model or DCM patients induces the expression of myocardial phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) though IR/IRS/ GRK2/ \u03b2 -arrestin2 / \u03b22AR/ extracellular regulated protein kinase (Erk) signaling cascade. A couple of target proteins of MG53 have been reported, including IR , IRS1 , and focal adhesion kinase . Focal adhesion kinase plays an important role in muscle development and homeostasis, and can be activated by receptor tyrosine kinase, such as IR/ IRS1 . IR/IRS1 transduces insulin signaling, and is important for myoblast growth, differentiation, autophagy, contractility, and metabolism . Therefore, as an E3 ligase of IR and IRS1that highly expressed in striated muscle, MG53 plays a pivotal role in controlling insulin sensitivity, and consequently, the whole-body glucose homeostasis and metabolism. Similar to the situation in the skeletal muscle, MG53 protein level is significantly increased in the heart of animal models with metabolic disorders , which is associated with decreased myocardial protein level of IR and IRS1. First, MG53 facilitates the degradation of myocardial IR and IRS1 through ubiquitination, and subsequently represses insulin signaling.", "Here we identified the gastro-resistant hypoglycemic bioactive peptides from protease-digested mcIRBP. By in vitro digestion and IR kinase activity assay, we found that a 9-amino-acid-residue peptide, mcIRBP-9, was a gastro-resistant peptide that enhanced IR kinase activities. mcIRBP-9 activated IR signaling transduction pathway, which resulted in the phosphorylation of IR, the translocation of glucose transporter 4, and the uptake of glucose in cells. Intraperitoneal and oral administration of mcIRBP-9 stimulated the glucose clearance by 30.91 \u00b1 0.39% and 32.09 \u00b1 0.38%, respectively, in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Moreover, a pilot study showed that daily ingestion of mcIRBP-9 for 30 days decreased the fasting blood glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels by 23.62 \u00b1 6.14% and 24.06 \u00b1 1.53%, respectively. In conclusion, mcIRBP-9 is a unique gastro-resistant bioactive peptide generated after the digestion of mcIRBP. Furthermore, oral administration of mcIRBP-9 improves both the glucose tolerance and the HbA1c levels in diabetic mice via targeting IR signaling transduction pathway.", "The AUCs were compared using Medcalc statistical software version 16.2.0, while NRI and IDI were calculated using R version 3.4.1 ( The characteristics of the subjects with different numbers of MS components were shown in Abbreviation: MVPA: Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity; BMI: body mass index; WC: waist circumference; FBG: fasting blood glucose; TG: triglycerides; HDL-C: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; HOMA-IR, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance; SBP: systolic blood pressure; DBP: diastolic blood pressure; L/A: leptin to adiponectin ratio; MS, metabolic syndrome. In boys, BMI, WC, FBG, TG, LDL-C, ln-insulin, ln-HOMA-IR, SBP and DBP were all positively correlated with leptin levels after adjustment for age, puberty, residence and lifestyle-related factors, such as physical activity and dietary intake (all To further compare the associations of leptin, adiponectin and L/A with MS, logistic regression analysis was performed with adjustment for age, puberty, residence and lifestyle-related factors including physical activity and dietary intake. Leptin and adiponectin, as two major adipokines derived from adipose tissue, have a broad spectrum of functions in the regulation of metabolism and are important link between obesity and MS [ In addition, given that leptin and adiponectin have opposite effects on subclinical inflammation and IR, it was speculated that the combining use of those two adipokines, the L/A, may function as a better biomarker in the diagnosis of MS. Several cross-sectional studies in adults have compared the diagnostic value of L/A with that of leptin or adiponectin alone, and most studies supported the notion [ For clinical practice, we also evaluated the optimal cut-off points of leptin, adiponectin and L/A for diagnosis of MS based on ROC analysis. Second, the HOMA model was used to assess IR; however, the HOMA model is not the gold standard for assessing IR, although it provides good diagnosis value compared to the gold standard clamp techniques in validation studies of adolescents.", "The capability of activated 4-IM to sensitize cells to IR was also assessed. Survival fractions of cells, determined by MTT assays, stably transfected with EGR1-CYP4B1 were compared with that of cells transfected with a control plasmid after IR followed by 4-IM. The results indicate IR potentiates the cytotoxic activity of the EGR1-CYP4B1/4-IM transgene system, but activated 4-IM does not sensitize cells to IR.", "Thus, combining radiotherapy with heparanase inhibition is an effective strategy to prevent tumor resistance and dissemination in IR-treated pancreatic cancer patients.", "Those cells that are dividing at a faster rate are much more sensitive toward IR, e.g., hematopoietic system, gonadal cells and developing embryo. It is a biomarker of IR exposure, but it requires large time and trained workers for analysis. [ IR is a form of energy that is basically of two types. [ Exposure to IR shows a combination of many consequences, such as early physical symptomatology at the prodromal stage of the acute radiation syndrome (ARS), lymphocyte counts, cytogenetic biomarkers, metabolic and serum components, urinary components and somatic mutation[ Radiation responsive biomarkers After total body irradiation (TBI), prodromal stage symptoms provide a rough estimation of the amount of the radiation dose received. Dose-response curve for chromosomal aberration has been confirmed with Dicentric biomarker:Dicentrics and ring chromosomes (chromosome with two centromeres) are important biomarkers of the IR exposure, which are formed by asymmetrical interchromosomal exchanges. [ Micronuclei biomarkers: Very low doses of IR, such as X-rays and gamma rays, might not produces double-strand DNA breaks, result in the formation of unstable chromosomal aberrations. [ Translocation: IR can cause various types of DNA damage that may lead to the stable chromosomal aberration. Analysis of unstable chromosomal aberrations by the classical cytogenetic method of large groups of people exposed to IR after any nuclear accident becomes difficult because they degrade simultaneously. [ Premature chromosome condensation:IR-induced damage can also be detected in the interphase cells by the premature chromosome condensation assay. [ IR causes tissue-specific lesions, and they are hardly predictable. Increase or decrease in acute phase proteins after exposure to IR indicates the intensity of inflammation, e.g. Protein biomarkers of skin injury for IR may be peroxidise, zinc-\u03b1-2 glycoprotein and compliment C9. [ Exposureof human beings to IR results in the creation of free radicals that cause damage to biomolecules such as protein, lipid and DNA, or may also induce oxidative stress. [ IRcauses damage of DNA, both double-stranded or single breaks, and DNA cross linkages corresponding to dose received. IR such as that created by radioactive decay or in cosmic rays causes breaks in DNA strands (induced damage).", "The Az-labeled protein was studied using ultrafast two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) vibrational echo spectroscopy. Therefore, it was possible to use Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and 2D IR spectroscopic experiments on the Az in unligated Mb and in Mb bound to CO (MbAzCO) and on the CO in MbCO and MbAzCO to investigate the environment and motions of different states of one protein from the perspective of two spectrally resolved VDLs. A very broad bandwidth 2D IR spectrum, encompassing both the Az and CO spectral regions, found no evidence of direct coupling between the two VDLs. The AzPhe VDL also permitted study of oxidized Mb dynamics, which could not be accessed previously with 2D IR spectroscopy. The experiments demonstrate that the combined application of 2D IR spectroscopy and site-specific incorporation of VDLs can provide information on dynamics, structure, and interactions at virtually any site throughout any protein. Under the appropriate circumstances, IR methods are well suited for characterizing proteins from the perspective of a specific environment. When incorporated into a protein, the vibration(s) of an IR label provide a sensitive reporter of its environment; the center frequency is indicative of the average local electric field as well as possible direct interactions, such as hydrogen bonding. Ultrafast IR techniques can operate on a sufficiently short time scale to resolve fast dynamics that can be important to protein function. Although fruitful investigations have been directed at the amide backbone vibrations of proteins, Previously, unnatural amino acids bearing azide (Az), Although Az-labeled analogues of alanine (Ala), methionine (Met), and phenylalanine (Phe) may be residue-specifically incorporated into proteins, Az provides an intense absorption for the study of protein environments, but its FT-IR spectrum can be difficult to interpret. Multiple environments often manifest as multiple bands in an IR probe\u2019s FT-IR spectrum. Furthermore, Az absorption bands typically have Voigt line shapes, so the distribution of Az frequencies, or the distribution of the probe\u2019s environments, cannot be determined from the FT-IR spectrum alone. The measurement of time-dependent frequency fluctuations and even the extent to which a spectroscopic line is inhomogeneously broadened requires time-dependent IR spectroscopy. Ultrafast 2D IR vibrational echo spectroscopy can be used to identify the origin of multiple IR absorption bands, extract the homogeneous and inhomogeneous contributions to the linear line width, and determine the time scales and amplitudes of frequency fluctuations arising from protein structural motions. 2D IR vibrational echo spectroscopy has been applied to the study of protein dynamics, including their role in ligand binding, Here we report the genetic site-specific incorporation of AzPhe into myoglobin (Mb) at position Phe43 (MbAz) as a vibrational dynamics label (VDL) for investigating structural dynamics using 2D IR spectroscopy, and to demonstrate the general applicability of this approach for dynamical studies of proteins. Phe43 is oriented into the heme pocket, and thus MbAz is expected to position the Az proximal to any bound heme ligands ( Sperm whale Mb with a N-terminal His For the IR experiments, the samples were clarified through 0.45 Linear FT-IR spectra were acquired at 1 cm The 2D IR echo experiments involved application of three separately delayed, mid-IR pulses focused to a ~400 Pump\u2013probe experiments were also performed to determine the vibrational lifetimes and for use in processing the 2D IR data. A ~3.5 The linear FT-IR spectra were background-corrected by subtracting the appropriate background FT-IR spectra (the protein spectra without the VDL of interest), followed by fitting and subtracting a polynomial function to the spectral regions away from the CO and Az bands. The theory, analysis, and interpretation of 2D IR vibrational echo spectroscopy used here have been presented in full detail previously. The time dependence of the spectral diffusion was extracted from the 2D IR spectra using the center line slope (CLS) formalism. The multiexponential form of the FFCF, For the If \u0394 The FT-IR spectra of the CO stretching mode of MbCO and MbAzCO are shown in Comparison of the spectra of MbCO and MbAzCO ( The incorporation of AzPhe43 was modeled by manually introducing the Az group into the crystal structure of MbCO. The FT-IR spectra of the Az asymmetric stretching region without and with bound CO ( The multiple bands in the FT-IR spectra of Az in MbAz and MbAzCO could arise from either two distinct environments or splitting from a Fermi resonance. Upon reduction and CO binding, two major changes occur in the Az spectrum, as shown in The time-resolved pump\u2013probe experiments of the CO vibration in MbCO and MbAzCO yielded first excited state vibrational lifetimes ( Using broad band IR pulses, a 2D IR spectrum encompassing both the CO and Az spectral regions was obtained ( The changes in the 2D line shapes with increasing The The FFCFs for the CO show that the FT-IR line widths are dominated by inhomogeneous broadening, as observed previously. The CO stretches of MbCO and MbAzCO have very strong IR transitions, and the lifetimes are 20 ps. MbAz and MbAzCO show decay constants of 1.5 and 1.3 ps, respectively, the same within experimental error ( The FFCF parameters determined from fitting both the CLS decays and linear FT-IR spectra of Az show that the linear absorption line widths are substantially homogeneously broadened (see In addition to determining the homogeneous component, analysis of the time-dependent 2D spectra provides information on the time evolution of the protein structures that give rise to the inhomogeneous portions of the linear spectra. The amplitudes of the frequency fluctuations associated with the different time scales were determined for the FFCF of Az in MbAz and MbAzCO ( Here we have described the first use of a genetically encoded, site-specifically incorporated unnatural amino acid VDL for the investigation of the dynamics of a protein using 2D IR spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that the combined application of 2D IR spectroscopy and site-specific incorporation of VDLs should enable the characterization of protein dynamics using a VDL at virtually any site throughout a protein. Fast protein dynamics are important for small molecule diffusion through proteins, The use of the unnatural amino acid AzPhe as a VDL permitted study of dynamics in oxidized Mb, which was previously not accessible with 2D IR spectroscopy. While this current study was limited by the short lifetime of the Az, the incorporation of other VDLs as unnatural amino acids should enable 2D IR experiments access to longer time scales. FT-IR spectra of CO in (A) MbCO and (B) MbAzCO and of Az in (C) MbAz and (D) MbAzCO. 2D IR spectra of CO in MbCO (top panels) and MbAzCO (bottom panels) at two 2D IR spectra of Az in MbAz (top panels) and MbAzCO (bottom panels) at two 2D IR spectra of MbAzCO at Upper panel: CLS decays (symbols) and exponential fits (lines) for CO in MbCO (red) and MbAzCO (blue).", "The purpose of the study is to determine whether the L-carnitine can prevent the harmful effects of small intestinal IR injury in rats. Sham operated group (S), for shamoperated, the IR group for rats submitted to 45-minute of intestinal ischemia and 2-hour reperfusion, and IR+L group for those IR group treated with L-carnitine before reperfusion. The levels of BT were higher in the IR group than IR+L group (P < 0.05). The IR+L rats had enhancement of IL-10 and suppressed production of serum TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, compared to IR group rats (P < 0.05). The degree of pathological impairment in small intestine was lighter in IR+L than IR group (P < 0.05). The L-carnitine pretreatment has a positive effect on reducing levels of BT, on inhibiting secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, and on lessening intestinal mucosa injury during small intestinal IR injury. In the IR group, the rats underwent intestinal ischemia for 45 minutes through occlusion of the SMA with a micro vascular clamp. In the IR+L group, the rats were given intervention of intestinal ischemia, which was the same as that in the IR group, and they were injected L-caritine 80 mg/kg suspended in saline solution (total volume = 2 ml) through tail vein before reperfusion injury. Meanwhile, the rats were given 2 ml saline solution instead of L-caritine in both the S and IR groups. \u00b1 P < 0.05 compared to IR and IR+L groups * P < 0.05 compared to IR+L group The levels of BT had a significant increase in animals distributed to the IR group, compared to animals in the IR+L-carnitine and S groups (P < 0.05). Intestinal villus after IR in group II rats, with lifted epithelium, white blood cells, and monocytes in the Lamina propria (Grade 4) (H&E, \u00d7 100). The villus and glands were normal and inflammatory cell infiltration was not observed in mucosal epithelial layer in the sham operated group ( \u0394 P < 0.05 compared to IR and IR+L groups * P < 0.05 compared to IR+L group In all of the three groups, the Chius score was highest in the IR group, and it was lowest in the S group (P < 0.05). The score in the IR+L group was significantly lower than that in the IR group (P < 0.05) ( \u0394 P < 0.05 compared to IR and IR+L groups * P < 0.05 compared to IR+L group The concentrations of pro-inflammatory factors including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, and IL-6 in the experimental rats\u2019 serum in the IR and IR+L group were higher than that in the S group (P < 0.05). And the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1 and IL-6 in the IR group rats were higher than that in the IR+L group (P < 0.05). The levels of inhibitive inflammatory factor IL-10 in the IR+L group were lower than that in the IR group (P < 0.05) ( The primary functions of the intestine are to absorb nutrients and exclude food debris, bacteria and their products. However, under certain pathological circumstances such as intestinal IR injury, the intestine may lose its barrier function so that the systemic microbial infection, and even MODS could be induced [ IR injury of the intestine is a complex, multifactorial, and pathophysiological process that involves the dysfunction of absorption, BT, actions of oxygen-derived free radicals, cytokines, nitric oxide, and PMNs [ The intestinal IR injury can lead to mucosal cells energy exhaustion and is also associated with decrease in ATP synthesis [ L-Carnitine can carry long-chain fatty acylgroups into mitochondria for beta-oxidation. Moreover, the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-10 in serum ( In conclusion, the increase of L-carnitine density in IR intestine is a protective event. Mucosal injury and BT were reduced in the L-carnitine group, compared with the IR group (P less than 0.05). And L-carnitine effectively inhibited releasing of pro-inflammatory factors, compared with IR group (P less than 0.05). In addition, L-carnitine can protect intestine from IR injury because it can improve absorption of nutrients and prevention of BT.", "Impaired insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)-mediated insulin signal transduction is a major component of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle following burn injury. The increase of iNOS expression paralleled the increase of insulin resistance, as evidenced by decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1, IRS-1 expression, insulin-stimulated activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt/PKB, and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in mouse skeletal muscle. Gene disruption of iNOS ameliorated the effect of burn on IRS-1-mediated insulin signaling in skeletal muscle of mice. When phosphorylated by IR, IRSs binds and transduces the insulin signal downstream to the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The IRSs\u2013PI3K\u2013Akt pathway plays a central role in the metabolic actions of insulin, including stimulation of glucose uptake, and synthesis of glycogen and protein [ Chronic inflammatory response has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity-related insulin resistance [ Adult male C57BL/6 mice and iNOS knockout (\u2212/\u2212) mice at 14 weeks of age, purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), were used for this study. PI3K activity in the immunoprecipitates with anti-IRS-1 antibody was measured by At 3 days after burn or sham-burn, following 4-h fasting, blood glucose levels were measured just before and at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after insulin injection (1 U/kg BW, Humulin R). GAPDH protein expression was unaltered by either burn injury or iNOS deficiency ( In wild-type mice, insulin injection induced robust tyrosine phosphorylation of IR in skeletal muscle of sham-burned animals, whereas insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IR in burned mice was decreased to 28% of that in sham-burned wild-type mice (p<0.01) ( Insulin induced marked tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in skeletal muscle of sham-burned mice. Although insulin failed to increase tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in burned wild-type mice, disruption of the iNOS gene partially restored tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in response to insulin in burned mice (p<0.05) ( We further investigated the effects of burn and disruption of iNOS on PI3K, a key downstream molecule of the insulin signaling pathway. Insulin increased p85 PI3K binding to IRS-1 in skeletal muscle of sham-burned mice. Yet, consistent with the failure of insulin to increase IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in burned wild-type mice, the binding of p85 PI3K to IRS-1 did not increase in response to insulin in burned wild-type mice ( Consistent with the effects of burn and iNOS deficiency on PI3K activity, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt was significantly reduced by burn injury in wild-type mice, and gene disruption of iNOS reverted this burn-induced decrease in insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation ( To further investigate the biological relevance of the amelioration of impaired insulin signaling by iNOS deficiency in burned mice, we evaluated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle Burn injury was associated with whole-body insulin resistance in wild-type mice, as judged by insulin tolerance test. Gene disruption of iNOS reverted burn injury-induced insulin resistance ( We found that gene disruption of iNOS significantly ameliorated impaired IRS-1-mediated insulin signaling in skeletal muscle of burned mice. Consistent with our previous studies in rats [ Mitigation of impaired insulin signaling by gene disruption of iNOS was observed at the levels of both IR and IRS-1 in skeletal muscle of burned mice. In insulin-resistant states, the impaired insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, a major component of insulin resistance, may result from decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by IR kinase, reduced IRS-1 expression, or a combination of both. Both attenuated IR kinase activity, reflected by reduced insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IR, and decreased IRS-1 expression were associated with insulin resistance in skeletal muscle of burned mice. It should be noted, however, that when normalized to IRS-1 protein expression, the ratio of insulin-stimulated IRS-1 phosphorylation vs IRS-1 protein expression was not altered by iNOS deficiency in either sham or burned animals ( Improvement of reduced IRS-1 expression by iNOS deficiency was in agreement with our previous study which showed that iNOS and NO donor reduce IRS-1 expression in cultured skeletal muscle cells, and that iNOS deficiency restored the reduced IRS-1 expression in skeletal muscle of genetically obese, diabetic ( With respect to tyrosine phosphorylation of IR, the effects of iNOS deficiency on insulin signaling seem to differ between burn injury- and obesity-induced insulin resistance. In burned mice, gene disruption of iNOS significantly improved insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IR as well as IRS-1 ( Insulin resistance of critical illness lasts longer [ In combination with insulin insufficiency (pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction), insulin resistance is a major causative factor for hyperglycemia. These results suggest that iNOS may exert insulin-desensitizing effects, at least in part, by suppressing the protein expression of IRS-1 in skeletal muscle after burn injury. Induction of iNOS paralleled attenuated IR- and IRS-1-mediated insulin signaling in skeletal muscle after burn injury in wild-type mice. Immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by immunoblotting demonstrated that insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation (PY) of IR and IRS-1 was significantly decreased at 3 days after burn injury. The protein expression of IR was unaltered by burn injury. In contrast, IRS-1 protein expression was significantly decreased at 3 and 7 days after burn injury as compared with before burn injury. E, The ratio of insulin-stimulated IRS-1 phosphorylation normalized to IRS-1 protein expression was significantly decreased at 3 days after burn injury. * iNOS deficiency mitigated burn injury-induced impairment in IR- and IRS-1-mediated insulin signaling in skeletal muscle. The overall interaction between genotype and burn/sham is statistically significant ( iNOS deficiency ameliorated attenuated IRS-1-mediated PI3K activation in skeletal muscle of burned mice. A, B, Insulin injection resulted in a robust increase in binding of p85 PI3K to IRS-1 in sham-burned mice, as judged by immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-IRS-1 antibody followed by immunoprecipitation (IB) with anti-p85 antibody. However, insulin failed to increase p85 binding to IRS-1 in burned wild-type (WT) mice. iNOS deficiency (\u2212/\u2212) significantly improved insulin-stimulated binding of p85 to IRS-1 in burned mice. The overall interaction between genotype and other factors (burn/sham and insulin/saline) is statistically significant for binding of p85 PI3K to IRS-1 ( Burn injury-induced decreases in insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle were reversed by iNOS deficiency.", "We demonstrate that Gadd45a is induced by IR and results in p53 phosphorylation. The role of IR-induced Gadd45a in G2-M arrest is demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis in the cells treated with siRNA Gadd45a and Ov-exp Gadd45a. Furthermore, we show the anti-tumorigenic role of Gadd45a to be mediated by the negative regulation of IR-induced cancer cell invasion and migration-associated proteins, such as matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-9 and \u03b2-catenin. When compared with IR treatment alone, Ov-exp Gadd45a plus IR treatment resulted in decreased nuclear localization and increased membrane localization of \u03b2-catenin, and this was further confirmed by membrane distribution. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that upregulation of Gadd45a or suppression of MMP-9 (pM) with IR retards medulloblastoma tumor metastatic potential.", "Two SSBs on opposite DNA strands approximately 6\u201310 bp apart results in the formation of a DNA double strand break (DSB), which is considered the most lethal form of DNA damage ( NHEJ, the major pathway for the repair of IR-induced DSBs in mammalian cells, requires Ku70/80, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), Artemis, XRCC4 (X-ray cross complementing gene 4), XLF (XRCC4-like factor) and DNA-ligase IV ( Here, we show that both DNA-PK and ATM phosphorylate PNKP His-PNKP was expressed as described previously ( DNA-PKcs and Ku were purified from the nuclear salt wash of unirradiated HeLa cells or from human placenta as described previously ( Purified His-PNKP (0.5 \u00b5g) was incubated with DNA-PKcs (0.3 \u00b5g) and Ku (0.1 \u00b5g) and phosphorylated Serine to alanine mutations at serines 114 and 126 (S114A and S126A, respectively) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis from the pGEX-6P-1-PNKP-wt plasmid using methods described previously ( A phosphospecific antibody recognizing S114 of PNKP was raised in sheep against the phospho-peptide: RTPE HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 5% Hyclone III fetal bovine serum, containing 50 U/ml of penicillin and 50 \u00b5g/ml of streptomycin, and maintained at 37\u00b0C under an atmosphere of 5% CO ATM-proficient, human lymphoblastoid cells BT/C3ABR cells were irradiated with 10 Gy IR and whole cell detergent lysis extracts were prepared 30 min after irradiation. Where indicated, reactions contained the ATM inhibitor KU55933 ( To determine whether PNKP was phosphorylated at these sites To determine whether S114 and S126 were major sites of To further characterize the phosphorylation of PNKP IR induces phosphorylation of PNKP on S114. ( Given that both DNA-PK and ATM phosphorylate S114 IR-induced phosphorylation on serine 114 is ATM dependent, while phosphorylation at serine 126 is both ATM and DNA-PK dependent. ( Although, these results eliminated a role for DNA-PK under these experimental conditions, we considered it possible that DNA-PK might play a role at higher doses of IR or at longer times after irradiation. Indeed, we have previously observed that IR-induced phosphorylation of the PIKK target Artemis is largely ATM dependent at low doses of IR (<2 Gy) and short times (<2 h) after IR, while at higher doses (10\u201320 Gy) and longer times (4 h), phosphorylation becomes in part DNA-PK dependent (R. Ye, S. Hiebert and S.P. However, phosphorylation of PNKP on S114 remained highly ATM dependent 4 h post 20 Gy IR ( We next examined phosphorylation of S126 in response to IR. Phosphorylation at S126 was also IR inducible ( The experiments described above were carried out in cells that had been transiently transfected with wt-PNKP. We have previously observed that transient transfection can promote DNA-PK-dependent phosphorylation of some substrates in the absence of additional DNA damage ( IR-induced phosphorylation of PNKP at S114 is transient and ATM dependent while phosphorylation of S126 is transient and requires both DNA-PK and ATM. ( To estimate the stoichiometry of To determine whether ATM or DNA-PK was responsible for IR-induced phosphorylation in these cells, cells were pre-incubated with either NU7441 or KU5593 or both inhibitors together. As found for phosphorylation of PNKP after transient transfection, PNKP phosphorylation at both S114 and S126 was virtually abolished by pre-incubation with either the ATM inhibitor alone or both the ATM and DNA-PK inhibitors together ( To further examine the effects of PNKP phosphorylation on the cellular response to IR, shRNA-resistant PNKP containing A or D mutations at both S114 and S126 (PNKP-2A and PNKP-2D, respectively) was re-introduced into the shRNA-depleted cell line (clone 13) and stable cell lines were isolated. Sensitivity to IR was determined using clonogenic/colony formation assays. ( PNKP interacts with XRCC4, which in turn interacts with DNA ligase IV ( IR enhances the interaction between PNKP, XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV. Wt-PNKP bound DNA with a PNKP interacts with XRCC4 ( The stoichiometry of phosphorylation of PNKP on S114 and 126 in response to IR was ~0.1 pmol phosphate/pmol protein, or ~10% ( Recent phosphoproteomics studies have also identified serines 114 and 126 as IR- ( We show that PNKP is recruited to sites of microlaser-induced DNA damage rapidly (within 20s), consistent with its role in the rapid repair of modified DNA termini ( Consistent with previous reports, shRNA PNKP-depleted cells were modestly radiosensitive ( Our experiments also reveal that IR significantly enhances the interaction of XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV with PNKP. However, interaction of XRCC4 with PNKP-2A and PNKP-2D was also enhanced after IR, indicating that phosphorylation at these sites is not required for the enhanced interaction of PNKP and XRCC4 after IR, and the mechanism for this enhanced interaction is under investigation. PNKP protein containing mutations at S114 and S126 was also assayed for the effects on PNKP kinase, phosphatase and DNA binding activities It is also interesting to note that mutation of both the identified phosphorylation sites to aspartic acid (PNKP-2D) had significant effects on multiple PNKP activities Together, our results suggest that PNKP is recruited to sites of DNA damage presumably through its interactions with XRCC4 and that IR-induced phosphorylation of PNKP by ATM and/or DNA-PK may promote the retention of PNKP at sites of DNA damage.", "IR-related organ damage occurs invariably in several clinical conditions including trauma, organ transplantation, autoimmune diseases and revascularization procedures. We critically review available pre-clinical experimental information on the role of immune response in the expression of tissue damage following IR. Interventions such as prevention of binding of natural antibody to antigen expressed on the surface of ischemia-conditioned cells, inhibition of the ensuing complement activation, modulation of Toll-like receptors, B or T cell depletion and blockade of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines limit IR injury in preclinical studies.", "Short axis values of left ventricular end systolic (ES) and end diastolic (ED) dimension were obtained using a Vevo Three days following IR, animals were sacrificed and isolated hearts perfused at 37\u00b0C retrograde through the aorta with Krebs-Hepes buffer. Three days following IR, rats were subjected to small animal echocardiography ( To determine functional changes, left ventricular diameters were measured at peak systole and diastole to determine fractional area of shortening ( Apoptosis of CMs following IR is suggested to be the dominant cause of chronic heart failure [ In this report, we synthesized a targeting molecule consisting of GlcNAc tethered to an alkyl chain via a PEG linker. The hydrolysis half-life of PCADK polymer at pH 7.4 was four years in serum-free media [ The mitogen activated protein kinase p38 is known to be a key regulator of apoptotic pathways and is triggered by IR [ To evaluate the applicability of our GlcNAc-decorated nanoparticle as a drug delivery system to CMs In the structural response of rat model, no significant reduction in infarct size was seen between IR and PK-GlcNAc treatments, indicating no benefit of the empty sugar particle. However, delivering PK-GlcNAc-SB particles to the injured myocardium significantly decreased infarct by 35% from IR animals, indicating improved myocyte survival. Our data demonstrated significant decreases in fractional shortening in IR and PK-GlcNAc groups as compared with sham-operated animals. However, PK-GlcNAc-SB particle treatment restored nearly 50% of lost function over IR levels. Data are mean\u00b1SEM and are expressed as a ratio of phosphorylated to total p38 ( (a) Rats that received myocardial injection of (9\u2032-(4-(and 5)-chloromethyl-2-carboxyphenyl)-7\u2032-chloro-6\u2032-oxo-1,2,2,4-tetramethyl-1,2-dihydropyrido[2\u2032,3\u2032-6]xanthene (CMRA)-loaded GlcNAc-decorated particles (PK-GlcNAc-CMRA) immediately following IR exhibited a greater CMRA fluorescence three days post-IR than animals that had received PK-CMRA particles, indicating enhanced Immediately following IR, particles were injected directly into the injured myocardium.", "IR was estimated using fasting glucose and insulin by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Multivariate linear regression analyses indicated that Lg CRP, WHR, serum triglycerides (TGs) and magnesium were the major predictors of HOMA-IR. A multivariate logistic analyses showed that a CRP level above 3.0 mg/l was significantly associated with a 2.8-fold risk of having higher HOMA-IR (>2.52). BMI plays a key role in mediating the relationship of CRP and IR. Elevated serum TG (>1.71 mmol/l), WHR (>0.88), UA (>357 mmol/l) and lower serum magnesium (<0.78 mg/l) were associated with 5.26 (95%CI: 2.52-10.98, P<0.05), 3.02 (95%CI: 1.64-5.55, P<0.05), 1.97 (95%CI: 1.02-3.83, P=0.05) and 0.51 (95%CI: 0.28-0.81) folds risk of higher HOMA-IR, respectively in the unadjusted model. Serum magnesium, but not UA was an independent risk factor of HOMA-IR. The present study in prediabetic or early untreated diabetic Chinese postmenopausal women indicated that IR is significantly associated with increased inflammation (CRP and UA), serum TG, WHR and lower serum magnesium.", "Subjects included 56 healthy nondiabetic overweight/moderately-obese women classified as IR or IS based on whole-body glucose disposal. While plasma glucose differed most during physiological hyperinsulinemia in IR vs IS subjects, plasma FFA/glycerol differed most during basal insulin concentrations. In order to be eligible for this study volunteers were required to have a body mass index (BMI) between 25.0 and 35.0 kg/m Volunteers meeting the general eligibility requirements were admitted to the Stanford Clinical Translational Research Unit (CTRU) for determination of the ability of insulin to stimulate muscle glucose uptake and inhibit adipose tissue lipolysis, using a simpler version of the two-stage infusion method described by Korenblat ( In order to suppress endogenous insulin secretion, subjects were infused with octreotide (0.27 \u03bcg/m SSPG concentrations obtained during the second stage of the infusion were used to classify subjects as being IR or IS. Glucose, insulin concentrations were determined as described in previous studies from our laboratory Student\u2019s unpaired t-tests were used to compare normally-distributed variables between IR and IS groups, and chi-squared test was used for categorical variables. Plasma insulin, glucose, FFA, and glycerol concentrations of the IR and IS subgroups, before and at the end of each stage of the two-stage infusion study are seen in Plasma glucose, FFA, and glycerol concentrations were also significantly higher in the IR group at the end of the \u201chigh insulin\u201d infusion period, but the magnitude of the differences between the two groups was quite different. In this instance, plasma glucose concentrations were 3.0-fold higher in the IR group, whereas there was only a 1.4-fold difference in glycerol concentration. Measurements of plasma FFA concentrations in IR and IS individuals in the fasting state reveal only marginal and non-statistically-significant differences between the two groups, largely due to the fact that the fasting insulin concentrations in IR subjects are higher to compensate for insulin resistance and to maintain normoglycemia. However, during the first stage (\u201clow insulin\u201d) of the infusion study, when experimentally-induced insulin concentrations are comparable in all subjects, the ability of insulin to suppress FFA concentration is dramatically reduced in the IR as compared with the IS individuals, with a similar pattern seen for glycerol concentrations, emphasizing the resistance to insulin suppression of adipose tissue lipolysis in these individuals. Thus, during the \u201clow insulin\u201d infusion period, the defect in the ability of insulin to inhibit adipose tissue lipolysis in IR individuals is magnified, and is clearly more apparent than the evidence of a defect in insulin stimulation of muscle glucose uptake. In this instance, plasma glucose concentrations at the end of the infusion are dramatically elevated in IR vs IS individuals, whereas the plasma FFA and glycerol concentrations are highly suppressed in both groups, albeit to a significantly greater degree in the IS vs the IR group. Under these experimental conditions, characterized by higher insulin concentrations, the defect in the ability of insulin to stimulate muscle glucose uptake in IR individuals is magnified, whereas differences between the two experimental groups in the inhibition of FFA and glycerol release are minimized.", "It has been demonstrated that IR-induced inflammation negatively affects neural progenitor differentiation. Neurogenic niches, the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) in the hippocampus, are highly susceptible to IR-induced injury. The first group of animals was sacrificed 6 h post-IR to measure cytokine levels in the brain. The second group was sacrificed 7 days after IR and used for IHC. The protein concentration of keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC) in brain homogenates was significantly lower in The protein concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), KC, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measurable in brain homogenates 6 hours after IR. After IR, the concentration of IL-1\u03b2 was higher in Six hours after IR, brains were collected, homogenized and analyzed using multiplex immunoassay. Concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 IR-induced ablation of neurogenesis in the young hippocampus results in decreased, or even abolished, growth of the GCL [ The volume of GCL The The pro-inflammatory microenvironment post-IR is known to decrease neurogenesis and increase the number of glial cells [ To investigate the possible functional effects of IR in the absence of C3, the IntelliCage platform was used 2-3 months after IR. WT = wild type irradiated ( At the age of 4 months, the long-term effects of IR were evaluated in the GCL. The difference in GCL volume observed between WT and In this study, we investigated the role of C3 in IR-induced impairment of hippocampal growth and learning in young mice. We assessed the effects of C3 deficiency 6 hours (acute phase), 7 days (subacute phase) and several months after cranial IR. Our major findings were that C3 deficiency was associated with (i) higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines during the acute phase, (ii) higher numbers of microglia and a trend towards higher cell proliferation in the GCL during the subacute phase, and (iii) better learning capacity after IR. During the acute (initial 2-12 hours) response to IR, acute cell death in the neurogenic region coincides with a transient production of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines in the young rat brain [ The DG, in particular the proliferating cells in the SGZ of the GCL, are known to be affected by IR. This may occur in at least three ways: through cell death (apoptosis or mitotic catastrophe), through decreased proliferation and through perturbed precursor cell differentiation [ We observed that the irradiated In summary, we have shown that growing hippocampi devoid of C3 show less adverse effects of IR, including better cognitive performance in adulthood. C3 is an important mediator of IR-induced impairment of early hippocampal growth and function. For IR a linear accelerator (Varian Clinac 600 CD; Radiation Oncology Systems LLC, San Diego, CA, USA) with 4 MV nominal photon energy and a dose rate of 2.3 Gy/min was used. The IR source to skin distance was ~99.5 cm. The head was covered with a 1 cm tissue equivalent material to obtain an even IR dose throughout the underlying tissue. After IR, the pups were returned to their biological dams until sacrificed. Na\u00efve mice were sham-irradiated and anaesthetized but not subjected to IR. The short term brains (7 days after IR) were cut in a 10-series and the long term brains (4 months after IR) were cut in a 12-series. Every 10 For analysis of newly generated microglia 50 PPH3 IR and control animals were sacrificed by decapitation 6 h after IR (P10).", "IFN signaling activates multiple interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and leads to growth arrest and cell death in exposed cell populations [ Recently we identified DEXH box RNA helicase LGP2 ( RLRs are represented by 3 major primary RNA sensors (RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2) and one common adapter protein MAVS (Mitochondrial anti-viral signaling protein-see Figure RIG-I and MDA5 are able to recognize foreign viral RNAs based on their primary and secondary structure, size, structure of 5\u2032ends of RNAs and/or recognition of methylated patterns in the 5\u2032capping structures of RNAs [ In the current paper we used a combination of genetic, biochemical and bioinformatics approaches to systematically investigate the effects of the each component of RLR pathway on the ability of IR and chemotherapy to kill normal and tumor cells and produce IFN-beta. Our data indicate that the RLR pathway is necessary and sufficient in the ability of IR and chemotherapy to induce a cytotoxic response and IFN-beta production. RLR pathway confers tumor responses in We explored the role for RLR signaling in the response to IR. We hypothesized that following irradiation, endogenous RNA moieties are upregulated in the cytoplasm and thereby recognized by cytoplasmic RNA sensors (Figure Type I IFN receptor signaling was necessary for the cell death following IR exposure as evidenced by suppression of IR-induced apoptosis after administration of neutralizing anti-IFNAR1 monoclonal antibody ( RNA sensing via MAVS-dependent signaling is mediated by three RNA sensors \u2013 LGP2, RIG-I and MDA5. RIG-I and MDA5 promote MAVS activation, while LGP2 is thought to regulate RIG-I and MDA5 in cell- and viral-specific contexts [ At the cellular level, LGP2 We further examined the relative contributions of RIG-I and MDA5 in IFN-beta induction after exposure to IR. Ectopic expression of MAVS or RIG-I activated the IFN-beta promoter in an IR-dependent manner ( Recently it was demonstrated that treatment of fibrosarcomas with anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin, led to a cell-autonomous induction of ISGs via Toll-like receptor 3 but not the cytosolic sensor MDA5 [ RIG-I is an RNA binding protein with two caspase recruitment domains (CARD) responsible for MAVS activation, an RNA helicase domain, and a C-terminal domain which determines the primary binding of 5\u2032-phosphorylated dsRNA [ We further immunoprecipitated RNA bound to ectopically expressed RIG-I following IR (see scheme of the experiments in Figure Previous reports indicate that genotoxic stress activates the transcription of repetitive and non-coding RNAs [ To further confirm that RIG-I recognition of U1 induces IFN-beta signaling, we used Based on our experimental data, we hypothesized that DNA damaging therapies induce Type I ISG expression in cancer patients. Rubin &Thompson demonstrated that exposure of apoptosis-resistant tumor cells to etoposide, cisplatin and IR led to the up-regulation of repetitive RNA transcripts from Alu1 and SINE elements [ One potential mechanism of the accumulation of toxic dsRNA can occur by the combination of sense- and anti-sense transcription (convergent transcription) of simple trinucleotide repeats (TNRs), usually found in genomic microsatellite sequences. Accumulation of the long (95 TNRs) tracks of such double-stranded transcripts induced apoptosis and led to the death of more than 50% of targeted cells [ Our data indicate that IR and chemotherapy lead to transcriptional up-regulation of certain small non-coding RNAs and their nuclear to cytoplasmic translocation (see Figure Data described in the current report describe cell-intrinsic RNA responses to DNA damaging agents in tumor and normal cells. However, recently it was demonstrated that another cytoplasmic innate immune pathway \u2013 DNA-dependent STING pathway [ In conclusion, our data provide the first comprehensive demonstration of the role of RIG-I/MAVS pathway in Type I IFN induction in tumor cells exposed to IR and chemotherapy.

Studies showed that vitamin D/VDR regulates indirectly the expression of BRCA1 As shown in Consistent with the decrease in BRCA1 levels, VDR-depleted cells were hindered in their ability to form BRCA1 IRIF ( To test directly if VDR loss affects DNA repair by HR, we depleted VDR in MCF7 cells carrying an HR reporter construct. Vitamin D (1\u03b1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D Next, we tested whether vitamin D supplementation started concomitant with oncogenic Ras expression would have an impact on the onset of senescence ( Given the reduced BRCA1 and 53BP1 levels observed in Ras-induced senescent cells, we investigated the ability of these factors to be recruited to sites of DNA damage induced by IR. In all the cases, the active form of Vitamin D, 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D For assessing the ability of Ras-senescent cells to form DNA-repair foci, cells were irradiated with 3Gy and fixed and processed for immunofluorescence 3 or 6 hours post-irradiation to monitor 53BP1 and BRCA1 IRIF foci formation, respectively.

The aim of this study was to show the protective effects of prophylactic ozone administration against retinal IR injury. for 7 d. In the ozone + IR (O + IR) group (n = 7), 1 mg/kg of ozone was administered i.p. for 7 d before the IR procedure and at 8 d, the IR injury was created (as in IR group). In the IR group, the degree of retinal injury was found to be the highest. In the O + IR group, retinal injury was found to be decreased in comparison to the IR group. In the ozone group without retinal IR injury, the retinal injury score was the lowest. The differences in the antioxidant parameters SOD, GSH-Px and TAC were increased in the ozone group and the lowest in the IR group. The oxidant parameters MDA and TOS were found to be the highest in the IR group and decreased in the ozone group. IR injury is also positively correlated with the degree of early apoptosis.", "Notably, activity of dPKB/dAkt was also elevated in Loss-of-function mutations of the components of the insulin/IGF-1 pathway, including the insulin receptor (InR), chico (Drosophila Insulin Receptor Substrate (IRS)), PI3-kinase, and dPKB/dAkt, lead to reduced cell growth during Drosophila eye and wing development [ ey-GAL4-driven DRhoGEF2 expression led to increased apoptosis in 3 Taken together, using (A) Scanning electronic micrographs of adult eyes from (I) (TIF) Click here for additional data file.", "Regulator of G-protein signaling 5 (RGS5), highly expressed in different cell types of the human adult heart, is a guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein to inhibit many signaling pathways such as c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2) and p38 which promote cardiac IR-induced apoptosis. However the role of RGS5 in cardiac IR-induced apoptosis remains unclear. An in vitro IR model was applied to the isolated hearts of wild type mice (WT), RGS5-transgenic mice (TG), and RGS5-knockout mice (KO). Moreover, the inhibition of both JNK1/2 and p38 signaling markedly reversed IR-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in RGS5-KO mice. These studies show that RGS5 protects cardiomyocytes against apoptosis during IR through inhibiting both JNK1/2 and p38 signaling pathways.", "While enzymatically induced DSBs have \u201cclean\u201d ends that can be directly ligated, ends generated after exposure to IR are not ligatable and require the removal of damaged nucleotides before ligation. IR induces, in addition to DSBs, also single strand breaks (SSBs) and base damages that can locally (within 10 base pairs, bp) add to a DSB, thus increasing its complexity and presumably also its reparability. HRR is predominantly error-free using the sister chromatid as template to retrieve lost sequence information, but is as a result restricted to S- and G-phase of the cell cycle, where it confers radioresistance to IR-induced cell killing . When at a DSB only one of the resected ends invades the homologous molecule and establishes a replication fork by initiating in addition to leading also lagging strand DNA synthesis (which at times can be extensive), repair by another homology dependent pathway ensues known as break-induced replication (BIR) () . BIR is important for the repair of broken replication forks but may also engage under certain circumstances as alternative or even backup to SDSA or DSBR (). BIR is thought to be particularly important under conditions of DNA replication stress that underpins carcinogenesis and is therefore greatly increased in cancer cells . BIR shares many similarities to HRR, but also differs in some important aspects: in contrast to HRR, which is entirely Rad51-dependent, BIR has a Rad51-independent component . When operating on one-ended DSBs, BIR primes DNA synthesis that can encompass more than 100 kB, and can in lower organisms even reach the end of the chromosome . BIR requires most essential replication factors, as well as the non-essential Pol\u03b4 subunit, Pol32/PolD3 . In yeast, BIR has been associated with extensive loss of heterozygosity (LOH), formation of non-reciprocal translocations and complex chromosomal rearrangements . Notably, in human cells, replication stress induces PolD3-dependent, tandem head-to-tail intrachromosomal duplications with microhomology junctions, suggesting that repair of damaged replication forks by BIR contributes to genomic instability and cancer formation . Extensive residual repair of IR-induced DSBs in c-NHEJ deficient cells , but also efficient circularization of transfected viral genomes in Ku-deficient cells , as well as the circularization or intermolecular ligation of linearized plasmid molecules in extracts prepared from mutants lacking essential c-NHEJ activities , suggested early on the presence of alternative end-joining mechanisms (alt-EJ) of DSB processing . DSBs, particularly when induced by IR, are not a single biochemical entity. Thus, localized exposure to IR during cancer treatment elicits systemic effects through extracellular signals generated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) , growth factors or cytokines . Thus, while ligand mediated activation of EGFR causes its internalization in clathrin-coated pits followed by degradation (reviewed in ), IR-mediated EGFR stimulation activates the Src kinase, which mediates the formation of caveolin-1/EGFR complexes and its translocation into the nucleus. However, IR and other cytotoxic agents are also known to activate this pathway through a ligand independent mechanism (see below). Here, IR-induced interactions between the C-terminal domain of Akt1 and DNA-PKcs lead to the formation of a functional complex involved in the initial steps of c-NHEJ, which facilitates the recruitment to Ku-bound DNA ends . These observations are in line with results from our laboratory showing that treatment of cells with the Akt inhibitor, MK-2206, results in increased number of IR induced RPA and Rad51 foci and enhanced HRR, as measured using the DR-GFP reporter assay (unpublished data). Systemic effects of IR are not limited to growth factor signaling and bystander effects. Strong effects of IR on the immune system and its cellular constituents are known and investigated for decades. IR is traditionally viewed as an immunosuppressive agent . In addition to making tumor cells better targets for killing by host immune cells, IR is capable of directly inducing \u201cimmunogenic\u201d forms of cell death which, in contrast to immunologically silent forms of cell death like apoptosis, promote inflammation and act as a form of vaccine that induces a tumor-specific immune response . Besides cell death, induction of senescence as a consequence of IR-induced DNA damage can also contribute to the stimulation of the immune system. Beyond the immunologic reactions triggered directly or indirectly by IR induced DNA damage, a multitude of links and interactions exists between the immune system and the DNA damage response, many of which, including the interferon response, can be observed in the context of viral infection and suggest a bidirectional cross-talk between these entities .", "Further analyses revealed that two CRE-binding transcription factors, CREB and ATF2, function as a transcriptional activator and repressor, respectively, of NE-like differentiation and that IR induces NE-like differentiation by increasing the nuclear content of phospho-CREB and cytoplasmic accumulation of ATF2. Consistent with this notion, stable expression of a non-phosphorylatable CREB or a constitutively nuclear-localized ATF2 in LNCaP cells inhibits IR-induced NE-like differentiation. IR-induced NE-like morphologies are reversible, and three IR-resistant clones isolated from dedifferentiated cells have acquired the ability to proliferate and lost the NE-like cell properties. Also, these three IR-resistant clones exhibit differential responses to IR- and androgen depletion-induced NE-like differentiation. However, they are all resistant to IR-and the chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel-induced cell death, and to androgen depletion-induced growth inhibition. To determine the effect of CREB-S133A and nATF2 on IR-induced NED, we used a tetracycline-on system (Invitrogen) to establish stable cell lines that inducibly expressed HA-CREB-S133A or Flag-nATF2. To study IR-induced NED in IR-resistant clones, cells were similarly treated as described above for wild-type LNCaP cells. To determine the response of IR-resistant clones to androgen depletion treatment, cells were cultured in phenol-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% Charcoal/Dextran-treated FBS (C/D-FBS) for three weeks and similarly assayed for morphological changes and the induction of NE markers CgA and NSE. Wild-type or IR-resistant clones were cultured in 48-well plates and irradiated with fractionated IR (2 Gy/day), or treated with docetaxel (5 nM) or cultured in phenol-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% C/D-FBS for the indicated times. Cell viability for IR- and docetaxel-treated cells was determined using an MTT assay as described previously ( In an attempt to isolate radiation resistant clones by following a clinical protocol (70 Gy) ( To determine the subcellular localization of ATF2 in IR-induced NE-like cells, we performed immunostaining and found that ATF2 localization in the cytoplasm was increased compared to non-treated cells ( To determine whether ATF2 cytoplasmic localization is a consequence or a potential cause of NED, we examined ATF2 subcellular localization at different time points before cells underwent morphological changes. Irradiation of cells up to five times increased cytoplasmic ATF2 without inducing striking morphological alterations ( Because CREB regulates transcription of CgA ( The IR-induced cytoplasmic accumulation of ATF2 and nuclear pCREB prompted us to test the hypothesis that nuclear CREB and ATF2 may play an opposing role in NED. Indeed, 50% knockdown of ATF2 resulted in an NE-like morphological change ( To further determine the role of CREB and ATF2 in IR-induced NED, we established tetracycline-inducible stable cell lines that express nATF2 or a non-phosphorylatable CREB (CREB-S133A), which has been used as a dominant negative mutant form of CREB ( To determine the relationship between the expression of nATF2 and IR-induced phosphorylation of CREB and the relatioship between the expression of CREB-S133A and the subcellular localization of ATF2, we irradiated cells for five days while constantly inducing expression of nATF2 or CREB-S133A. Expression of CREB-S133A did not affect IR-induced cytoplasmic localization of ATF2 (data not shown), whereas expression of nATF2 significantly inhibited IR-induced phosphorylation of CREB ( Because cAMP-induced NE-like cells are reversible ( To determine whether these IR-resistant clones can still be induced to redifferentiation, we irradiated them for 40 Gy and examined for morphological changes and the induction of CgA and NSE. However, ATF2 activates the transcription of insulin, whereas CREB inhibits it ( The finding that IR can induce NED is clinically important, given that approximately 10-60% of patients treated with radiation therapy experience recurrent tumors ( We would like to thank Drs.", "IR and PTP1B localization was examined by immunohistochemistry. The activation of IR was analyzed using specific antibodies against phosphotyrosine. Glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins containing wild-type and catalytically inactive mutant PTP1B was used to study the interaction between IR and PTP1B. Anti\u2013IR immunoprecipitates and the cytoplasmic domain of purified IR were incubated in the presence of ATP, and the autophosphorylation of IR with antiphosphotyrosine antibody was analyzed. The IR is predominately expressed in rod inner segments. Biochemical analysis of rod outer segments indicates the presence of IR and PTP1B. Retinal IR exhibits a high level of basal autophosphorylation, and this autophosphorylation is reduced in diabetic mouse retinas. In vitro, PTP1B is able to dephosphorylate the autophosphorylated IR. Substrate mutant-trap results indicate a stable interaction between IR and PTP1B. These studies indicate that diabetes reduces the autophosphorylation of retinal IR and increased PTP1B activity. Further, PTP1B regulates the state of IR phosphorylation in the retina. Insulin receptors (IRs) and insulin signaling proteins are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Specific PTPs, including LAR, SHP-2, and protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B), have been implicated in the regulation of normal IR signaling. In this study we observed increased basal retinal IR autophosphorylation compared with liver samples. In diabetes, the IR autophosphorylation was reduced, and we hypothesized that this decreased IR autophosphorylation could be the result of increased PTP1B activity. In this study we also demonstrated a stable interaction between the IR and PTP1B. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that PTP1B regulates the state of IR phosphorylation in the retina. Blots were then incubated with anti\u2013IR\u03b2 (1:1000) or anti\u2013PTP1B (1:1000) or anti\u2013actin (1:1000) antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. To determine whether IR was a physiological substrate of PTP1B, we used the substrate trapping mutant of PTP1B to study the stable interaction between PTP1B and IR. We transiently transfected human IR into HEK-293T cells. Pervanadate-treated cell lysates were incubated with GST, GST-PTP1B, or GST-PTP1B-D181A fusion proteins, and the bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti\u2013IR\u03b2 antibody ( To determine whether PTP1B dephosphorylates IR autophosphorylation in vitro, we autophosphorylated the cytoplasmic domain of purified human IR (GST-IR) as follows: GST-IR was incubated for 90 minutes at 30\u00b0C at 0.05 \u00b5g/\u00b5L in 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mM ATP. The results indicate that PTP1B shows more prominent expression in nonphotoreceptor layers (outer plexiform, inner nuclear, and ganglion cell layers) of the retina, though it is clearly expressed in photoreceptors as well ( IR was immunoprecipitated from rat retina and rat liver with anti\u2013IR\u03b2 antibody and subjected to in vitro autophosphorylation in the presence and absence of insulin. Phosphorylated samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis with anti\u2013PY99 antibody ( IR was immunoprecipitated with anti\u2013IR\u03b2 antibody from lysates of retina and liver, and immune complexes were used to measure the kinase activity in the presence and absence of insulin. In the absence ( It has previously been shown that IR kinase activity is decreased in diabetes. To further demonstrate whether IR levels are changed by hyperglycemia, we immunoblotted control and STZ retinal lysates with anti\u2013IR\u03b2 antibody. The results indicate no significant difference in the level of retinal IR between control and hyperglycemic conditions ( To determine whether the state of IR phosphorylation is regulated by PTP1B, we examined PTP1B levels from control and STZ-treated retinas by immunoblot analysis with anti\u2013PTP1B activity. These results reveal a significantly increased PTP1B activity in diabetic mouse retinas compared with control retinas ( It has previously been shown that basal IR kinase activity in the retina is significantly greater than in the liver and that IR kinase activity remains constant between freely fed and fasted rats, suggesting that IR activation is not regulated by circulating insulin. Our studies indicate that PTP1B and IRs are expressed in rod inner segments. To determine whether IR is a physiological substrate of PTP1B, we took advantage of a substrate-trapping mutant of PTP1B. Wild-type and mutant PTP1B GST-fusion proteins were expressed in In vitro autophosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of human IR. GST-IR was incubated for 90 minutes at 30\u00b0C in the presence of cold ATP, as described in Results. Autophosphorylated IR ( Immunocytochemical analysis of PTP1B and IR in mouse retina. Paraffin-fixed sections of rat retina were stained for PTP1B ( Retinal IR displays a high basal level of autophosphorylation. The IR was immunoprecipitated with anti\u2013IR\u03b2 antibody ( Reduced IR autophosphorylation in STZ mouse retinas.", "Because macrophages (M\u03b8s) express TLR4 and are important in IR and atherosclerotic lesion formation due to their infiltration of white adipose tissue (WAT) and the artery wall, respectively, we hypothesized that deficiency of M\u03b8 TLR4 could protect against these disorders. M\u03b8s are cells of the innate immune system that have been implicated to play a pivotal role in development of diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, and most recently, IR [ Because of the close link between obesity, macrophages, and inflammation, the activation of M\u03b8s via toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) has become an important area of research. Despite an absence of differences in body weight, total fat, or perigonadal fat pad weight, M\u03b8TLR4-/- mice fed a diet low in total fat displayed decreased ATM accumulation as evidenced by F4/80 mRNA expression ( Several studies have investigated the effects of global TLR4 deficiency on body composition, adipose tissue physiology, inflammation, and IR Previous reports have established that in the absence of whole body TLR4, mice fed high fat diets or subjected to lipid infusion are protected against insulin resistance as evidenced by glucose tolerance tests, insulin signalling, and hyperinsulinemic-euglycaemic clamps [ While our results provide evidence that supports a role for M\u03b8 TLR4 in ATM content and inflammation, these effects were apparent only in the context of LF diet feeding and were only moderate.", "Lithium (10 mM LiCl) increased basal glucose transport by 49% ( Insulin action on the glucose transport process in skeletal muscle involves the sequential engagement of several intracellular signalling factors (reviewed in Evidence in the literature also supports a role of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) in the regulation of the glucose transport system in insulin-sensitive skeletal muscle ( Insulin resistance of the skeletal muscle glucose transport system is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes and several cardiovascular risk factors (reviewed in The alkali metal lithium, a non-selective GSK-3 inhibitor ( In the context of the foregoing information, the present investigation was designed to address two primary aims:(1) to examine whether lithium activates glucose transport activity in isolated insulin-resistant skeletal muscle of the female obese Zucker rat by engaging critical elements of the insulin signalling cascade, including including IR tyrosine phosphorylation, Akt ser Female obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) and were used at 9-11 weeks of age and with body weights in the range of 300-350 g. Animals were housed in a temperature-controlled room (20-22\u00b0C) with a 12:12 hour light:dark cycle (lights on from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.) at the Central Animal Facility of the University of Arizona. In some experiments, muscles were incubated with A304000 (10 \u03bcM), a highly selective inhibitor of the p38 MAPK ( At the end of the 1 h initial incubation, Analysis of tyrosine-phosphorylated IR-\u03b2 was performed via immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. For analysis of phosphorylated IR-\u03b2, 1 ml of diluted homogenate was immunoprecipitated with 15 \u03bcl of recombinant agarose-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and gently rocked overnight at 4\u00b0C. Immunoprecipitates were also immunoblotted with an antibody against IR \u03b2-subunit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Lithium, alone or in combination with insulin, did not affect tyrosine phosphorylation of IR-\u03b2 ( Lithium treatment induced a robust increase in thr The specific role of the p38 MAPK activation in the enhancement of glucose transport activity by lithium in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle was further investigated using A304000, a selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK ( In the present investigation, we have demonstrated that the alkali metal lithium increases basal glucose transport ( An additional major finding of the present study is that lithium induced a robust enhancement of p38 MAPK thr A single previous investigation has assessed the impact of lithium on glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle of the obese Zucker rat ( A comparison of lithium action on insulin-sensitive skeletal muscle from lean Zucker rats ( Despite the well-documented stimulatory effects of lithium on glucose transport and glycogen synthesis and the potential of lithium as a GSK-3 inhibitor, several confounding issues would limit the use of the lithium as a viable intervention in the treatment of human insulin resistance. Moreover, these effects of lithium are associated with enhanced serine phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3\u00df, but not tyrosine phosphorylation of IR-\u03b2.", "Using the SH2 domain-containing region of p120 GTPase-activating protein and growth factor-bound protein 2, we observed a tyrosine-phosphorylated M(r) 70,000 protein in insulin- plus PAO-treated NIH3T3 cells overexpressing the IR. This suggests that the M(r) 70,000 protein is a novel and specific substrate for the IR kinase or an insulin-induced tyrosine kinase.", "However, N-Acetylcystein, an antioxidant, fully abrogated programmed cell death mediated by the supernatant of IR-treated PBMCs, but not of LPS-treated PBMCs.", "", "The mRNA of glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit ( The protein levels of hepatic glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic ( Results were analyzed using two-tailed Student's Renal IR (45 min ischemia followed by 6 h reperfusion) resulted in a significant elevation of plasma creatinine level ( Renal IR resulted in a significant decrease in GSH levels and a low ratio of GSH to GSSG in the liver (Figures The transsulfuration pathway provides cysteine as an essential precursor for glutathione synthesis. To investigate whether renal IR affected this pathway in the liver, the expression of two enzymes ( To further investigate whether downregulation of hepatic In the present study, renal IR caused local and distant organ injury which was accompanied by a marked decrease in plasma and hepatic glutathione levels. In the present study, the ratio of reduced (GSH) to oxidized (GSSG) glutathione in the liver was markedly decreased in rats subjected to renal IR. Lower GSH to GSSG ratio observed in the liver and plasma indicated that oxidative stress occurred in the distant organs and systemically upon renal IR. However, renal IR caused a significant reduction in hepatic glutathione levels and impaired liver function, which was in line with findings by other investigators [ The availability of cysteine is another important determinant in modulating glutathione homeostasis as this amino acid is a precursor for glutathione biosynthesis [ In conclusion, renal IR elicits liver injury which is accompanied by reduced hepatic production of glutathione, an important endogenous antioxidant. Several lines of evidence obtained from the present study suggest that the remote effect of renal IR on liver glutathione depletion is caused by (1) inhibition of Nrf2-mediated expression of glutamate-cysteine ligase, a key enzyme that regulates glutathione biosynthesis, and (2) downregulation of This study was supported, in part, by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the St. Boniface Hospital Research Centre. Plasma reduced glutathione (GSH) (a), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) (b), a ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) (c), and plasma homocysteine (d) were measured in rats subjected to renal IR or sham operation. Liver reduced glutathione (GSH) (a), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) (b), a ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) (c), and liver malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (d) were measured in rats subjected to renal IR or sham operation. The Nrf2 protein was determined by Western immunoblotting analysis of the liver nuclear fraction of rats subjected to renal IR or sham operation.", "Early-passage MEFs were exposed to increasing IR doses up to 10 Gy, and plated for clonogenicity to quantify cell survival and proliferation. We observed a significant difference ( To determine if the IR resistance of Wwox-deficient cells persists Next, we sought a human cancer database with expression and clinical data for cancers treated with radiation to determine if loss of Wwox enabled tumor cell resistance to radiation and decreased overall patient survival in a human model. To verify that Wwox-deficient cells survive IR-induced DSBs because of enhanced HDR, we inhibited HDR via transient knockdown of Rad51, a critical protein for HDR-specific strand invasion. To confirm the Brca1\u2013Wwox interaction, we transfected HEK293T cells with HA-Brca1 plus full-length, myc-tagged Wwox plasmid (myc-Wwox) and performed immunoprecipitation using anti-HA and detection with anti-Brca1 ( Next, to determine which Brca1 domain was participating in the Wwox interaction, we transfected five Brca1 mutants, harboring deletions from the N to C terminus ( To confirm whether interaction with Brca1 through the WW domain is responsible for suppression of HDR and sensitivity to DSBs, the MDA MB-231 cells were stably transfected with doxycycline-inducible full-length Wwox harboring WW1 mutations As Brca1 forms complexes comprised of varying interacting proteins and these complexes have distinct functions during DSB recognition and repair, we sought to understand how Wwox\u2013Brca1 might enhance NHEJ and suppress HDR, through immunofluorescent detection of critical DSB repair-associated proteins: \u03b3H2AX, 53BP1, RIF1, Brca1, Rad51 and Rpa32 ( To quantify the accumulation of repair proteins at DSBs, the number of positive foci per nucleus were determined in 231/Wwox-pos and 231/Wwox-neg cells following 10 Gy IR as indicated in We have established a role for Wwox in the regulation of DSB repair, such that Wwox-deficient cells exhibit enhanced HDR and survival of DSB-inducing agents. ( Wwox expression inhibits growth of irradiated cancer cells Wwox-deficient cells exhibit increased homologous recombination, which is responsible for enhanced IR survival.

Wwox expression significantly decreases Rpa32 and Rad51 foci 1 h after IR and increases \u03b3H2AX foci 3 h after IR. Experiments were performed in triplicate and statistical significance was determined using the two-tailed Student's IR induced foci-based hypothetical model illustrating a role for Wwox in DSB repair pathway choice.", "In peripheral tissues, APN signaling leads to AMPK activation, which reduces IRS-1 phosphorylation at serine residues to enhance insulin sensitivity [ APN deficiency attenuated AMPK phosphorylation causing insulin resistance and deregulated insulin signaling in APN-KO mice.

AdMSC treatment alleviated IR-induced cell death, and the anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative effects of AdMSC were enhanced in the AdMSC/SIS group relative to the AdMSC group. These results suggest local transplantation of AdMSC improves tissue remodelling following radiation damage in SG tissue, and that use of a carrier enhances the protective effects of AdMSC-mediated cellular protection against IR via paracrine secretion.", "However, the effects of nitrate on myocardial IR injury in diabetic rats have not yet been investigated. We examined the effects of dietary nitrate on myocardial IR injury in streptozotocin-nicotinamide-induced diabetic rats. The hearts were perfused in a Langendorff apparatus at 2 months and assessed before (baseline) and after myocardial IR for the following parameters: left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), minimum and maximum rates of pressure change in the left ventricle (\u00b1dP/dt), endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression, and levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and NO metabolites (NOx). Diabetic rats had lower eNOS and higher iNOS expression both at baseline and after IR, and dietary nitrate restored these parameters to normal values after IR. Compared with controls, heart NOx level was lower in diabetic rats at baseline but was higher after IR. Diabetic rats had higher MDA levels both at baseline and after IR, which along with heart NOx levels decreased following nitrate intake. Dietary nitrate in diabetic rats provides cardioprotection against IR injury by regulating eNOS and iNOS expression and inhibiting lipid peroxidation in the heart. In brief, heart samples collected at baseline and at the post-IR period were rinsed and homogenized in PBS (1:5, w/v), and centrifuged at 15,000 g for 20 min. In all groups, samples from the left heart ventricle were obtained at baseline and during the post-IR period for RNA extraction using a standard, sterile surgical method. After STZ-NA injection and compared with controls, diabetic rats had increased blood glucose levels (196.8 \u00b1 26.4 The effects of dietary nitrate on hemodynamic parameters in isolated hearts during the stabilization and IR period are shown in Parameters of cardiac function during the stabilization period Data are represented as mean \u00b1 SEM.

In all groups, heart NOx levels increased significantly (p < 0.05) after IR when compared with baseline values. Compared with controls, heart NOx level was lower in diabetic rats before IR, but was higher after IR and decreased following nitrate intake in the DN group, both before and after IR when compared with diabetic rats ( Changes in NOx (A) and MDA (B) levels in the hearts of rats in different groups.

Compared with controls, diabetic rats had significantly higher MDA levels, both before and after IR (p < 0.05); nitrate intake restored the elevated MDA levels to near normal values in the CN and DN groups as compared with levels in the control and diabetic group, respectively ( Effect of nitrate intake on levels of LDH (A) and CK-MB (B) in coronary flow 5 min after reperfusion. In addition, nitrate intake restored heart levels of both NO In this study, we showed for the first time that chronic intake of a low dose of nitrate (100 mg/L for 2 months) protected the heart of rats in the control group from IR injury. Most studies assessing the effects of nitrate on IR injury have been performed In this study, hearts from STZ-NA-induced diabetic rats had lower baseline cardiac functions, a controversial finding in different animal models of diabetes. Our results show that diabetic rats had lower eNOS and higher iNOS expression both at baseline and after IR. Heart NOx level was also lower before IR, but was higher after IR, and heart MDA level was higher both before and after IR. To the best of our knowledge, no study so far has documented the effect of nitrate intake on IR injury in STZ-NA-induced diabetic rats. Nitrate intake in this study also offered cardioprotection by decreasing the levels of myocardial injury markers in CF and lipid peroxidation levels in the hearts of diabetic rats after IR, an effect that may be related to the antioxidative properties of nitrate intake that protect the membrane of heart cells by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and decreasing the leakage of cytosolic enzymes. In the present study, we found that nitrate intake protected the heart from IR injury by restoring iNOS and eNOS expression to normal values and subsequently reducing the accumulation of NO after IR. Nitrate intake restored cardiac function to near preischemic values after IR in diabetic rats by blocking the pathological increases in iNOS expression, as well as the pathological decrease in eNOS expression.", "EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; HER2: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; HIF1-\u03b1: hypoxia-induced factor 1-\u03b1; IGF-1: insulin-like growth factor 1; IGFBPs: IGF-1 binding proteins; IGF-1R: IGF-1 receptor; IR: insulin receptor; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; S6K: S6 kinase.", "", "We found that dCK could decrease IR-induced total cell death and apoptosis. Moreover, dCK increased IR-induced autophagy and dCK-S74 is required for it. Western blotting showed that the ratio of phospho-Akt/Akt, phospho-mTOR/mTOR, phospho-P70S6K/P70S6K significantly decreased in dCK-WT and dCK-S74E cells than that in dCK-S74A cells following IR treatment. IR increased polyploidy and decreased G2/M arrest in dCK knock-down cells as compared with control cells. Taken together, phosphorylated and activated dCK can inhibit IR-induced cell death including apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe, and promote IR-induced autophagy through PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. ( Interestingly, 3-MA and spautin-1 inhibited IR-induced autophagy and rapamycin increased it in both cell lines. We have demonstrated that activated dCK by IR can increase autophagy (protect cells) and suppress apoptosis. Moreover, suppressing autophagy could increase apoptosis induced by IR. dCK triggers the phosphorylation of cytarabine (Ara-C), CNDAC and other nucleoside analog drugs, which then inhibit tumor growth and promote apoptosis [ Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent self-digestion process [ Spautin-1 is a specific and potent autophagy inhibitor-1 that can inhibit USP10 and USP13, and promote the degradation of Beclin-1 [ Given that dCK was required for autophagy induced by IR, we further investigated the mechanism by which dCK regulates IR-induced autophagy. dCK can interact with Cdk1 after IR and the interaction inhibits Cdk1 activity [ Human cervical carcinoma cell line, HeLa, was cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (GIBCO, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in glass Petri dishes at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO Anti-dCK antibody was purchased from Abcam Inc (Cambridge, MA, USA). There were 1 \u00d7 10 Cells were plated into six-well plates and treated with IR; cells were then collected 24 h after IR. The significance of the differences between groups was determined by one-way ANOVA; In summary, our data demonstrated that dCK could inhibit IR-induced cell death through suppression of apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe and promotion of autophagy. dCK increased autophagy induced by IR via inhibition of the Akt/mTOR/p70 S6K pathway and dCK S74 phosphorylation participated in this regulation. Loss of dCK inactivated the G2/M checkpoint, allowing cells less time for repair and promoting entry into mitosis, inducing polyploidy increase, and eventually inducing mitotic catastrophe in response to IR. ( dCK silencing promoted IR-induced apoptosis. ( dCK promoted IR-induced autophagy in HeLa cells. ( Suppressing autophagy could increase apoptosis induced by IR.

OSI-906 successfully inhibited the phosphorylation of IR/IGF-1R and decreased cell growth in non-transformed cells. Both, the IR OSI-906 (linsitinib) is a selective dual inhibitor of the IR and IGF-1R and therefore a promising candidate for the treatment of various cancer types. Therefore, we combined the IR/IGF-1 R inhibitor OSI-906 with the OSI-906 is a selective inhibitor of the IR and the IGF-1R and we first wanted to monitor acute effects of a treatment in non-transformed BALB/c-3T3-A31-1-1 cells used for the transformation assay. After 24 hours treatment, OSI-906 decreased the phosphorylation of the IR/IGF-1R in a dose-dependent manner with no effect for 0.001 \u03bcM and a complete inhibition for 1 \u03bcM ( To test whether a decreased insulin/IGF signaling influences cellular transformation a two-stage BALB-CTA was performed.

Akt represents a central protein of the IR/IGF-1 R pathway, which targets several molecules of the tumor development machinery, like cell proliferation, cell metabolism and cell death through apoptosis A parallel pathway downstream of IR/IGF-1R is the Ras-Erk signaling cascade.", "Mechanistically, liver IR injury was accompanied by deteriorated mitochondrial respiration and enhanced ROS production and, as a consequence, by significantly increased inflammatory enzyme activities. GPC, by preserving the mitochondrial complex I function respiration, reduced the biochemical signs of oxidative stress after an IR episode. In addition to these events, the IR-induced increased activity of the main lipolytic enzymes also results in modified biomembrane structures, leading to a loss of essential membrane-forming glycerophospholipids[ These reactions can jointly influence the function of the inner mitochondrial membrane, which embeds the four major respiratory chain complexes and the F From therapeutic aspects, influencing mitochondrial damage is appropriate strategy in hypoxia- or IR-related conditions, and the above indirect evidences all suggest that GPC may be an active and efficient compound in this setting. In the vehicle-treated IR group (n = 6), the rats were subjected to a 60-min complete ischemia followed by a 60-min reperfusion; in the IR+GPC group a 16.56 mg/kg bw GPC (MW: 257.2, Lipoid GmbH, Ludwigshafen, Germany; dissolved in 0.5 ml of sterile saline solution at 0.064 mM concentration) was injected intravenously and the same protocol was used [ To measure the respiratory activity of the liver mitochondria, tissue samples were homogenized in mitochondrial respiration medium and then subjected to high-resolution respirometry. Animals were subjected to 60 min of liver ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion (IR group, black column) or were sham-operated (SHAM group, white column). 16.56 mg/kg GPC administration was started 5 min before the end of ischemia (IR+GPC group, grey column), or at identical time point in sham-operated animals (SHAM+GPC group, white striated column). As expected, XOR activity was increased in the IR group compared to the SHAM group. Animalsweresubjectedto 60 min of liverischemiafollowedby 60 min of reperfusion (IR group, blackcolumn) orweresham-operated (SHAM group, whitecolumn). 16.56 mg/kg GPC administrationwasstarted 5 min beforethe end of ischemia (IR+GPC group, greycolumn), oratidenticaltimepointinsham-operatedanimals (SHAM+GPC group, whitestriatedcolumn). #P< 0.05 vs SHAM group; *P< 0.05 vs IR group (one-way ANOVA, Holm-Sidak test). As expected, hepatocytes were exposed to increased levels of oxidative stress after IR, as shown by a significant increase of GSSG and the decreased GSH/GSSG ratio when compared to the SHAM group, however, the GSSG levels were significantly decreased in response to GPC treatment in the IR+GPC group ( MPO is mostly produced by PMN leukocytes upon their activation. In the vehicle-treated IR group, the tissue MPO level was significantly increased as compared with that of the sham-operated animals. In the GPC-treated group, the MPO activity was significantly lower than in the vehicle-treated IR group ( (A) Tissue MPO activity; (B) Tissue nitrite/nitrate (NOx) level; (C) Tissue MDA level. Animals were subjected to 60 min of liver ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion (IR group, black column) or were sham-operated (SHAM group, white column). 16.56 mg/kg GPC administration was started 5 min before the end of ischemia (IR+GPC group, grey column), or at identical time point in sham-operated animals (SHAM+GPC group, white striated column).MPO activity (in mU/mg protein); NOx level (in \u03bcM); tissue MDA (in mmol/ml). In the IR group, a significant elevation in NOx was present relative to the SHAM groups. The GPC treatment protocol decreased the NOx elevation, in contrast with the non-treated IR group; but the NOx level remained significantly higher than that in the sham-operated group ( As expected, IR resulted in an increased MDA production after IR ( The superoxide-producing capacity in the whole blood was significantly higher in the IR group at the end of reperfusion when compared to the SHAM animals. Animals were subjected to 60 min of liver ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion (IR group, black column) or were sham-operated (SHAM group, white column). 16.56 mg/kg GPC administration was started 5 min before the end of ischemia (IR+GPC group, grey column), or at identical time point in sham-operated animals (SHAM+GPC group, white striated column). The FITC-dextran and acriflavine staining demonstrated dilated sinusoids in the IR group, fluorescent dye leakage with edema formation was present with visible signs of structural damage: changes in hexagonal cell shape and cytoplasm blebbing and vesicle formation. GPC administration effectively attenuated the IR-induced morphological changes. Structural damages such as dilated sinusoids, loss of fluorescence intensity, changes in hexagonal cell shape, cytoplasmaticblebbing and vesicle formation can be observed in the IR group. IR injury is a common challenge of several fields of medicine. IR-induced antigen-independent inflammatory reactions are largely ignited by the overproduction of ROS and, mainly at the sites of complexes I and III, the mitochondria is among the major recognized sources [ GPC is a choline donor compound with a demonstrated parasympathomimetic action [ Regardless of its possible abundance in the membranes, liver concentrations of endogenous GPC are significantly depleted after hemorrhagic shock, a prototype of systemic IR injury [ The in vitro experimental data demonstrated the direct effects of GPC on mitochondrial oxygen consumption in the 100 and 200 mM concentration ranges. Flux control experiments confirm that the respiratory chain operates as one single functional unit [ Secondly, the redox-optimized ROS balance hypothesis postulates that the redox environment is the main controller of both production and scavenging of ROS as intermediary between mitochondrial respiration and ROS formation [ We have investigated IR-induced ETC changes together with XOR and NADPH oxidases responses. Furthermore, the IR-induced increases in superoxide and hydrogen peroxide levels in the circulating blood were accompanied by increased local NOx concentrations, providing indirect evidence for the evolving oxido-nitrosative stress in the liver tissue. GPC administration reversed the IR-induced decrease in GSH level and maintained the ratio of GSH to GSSG. GPC administration attenuated the membrane peroxidation and the consecutive stages of tissue damage therefore this type of mechanism might be an interesting focus for therapeutic strategies in IR episodes. Animals were subjected to 60 min of liver ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion (IR group, black column) or were sham-operated (SHAM group, white column). 16.56 mg/kg GPC administration was started 5 min before the end of ischemia (IR+GPC group, grey column), or at identical time point in sham-operated animals (SHAM+GPC group, white striated column).", "IR were studied by radioligand binding assays, cross-linking labeling, immunohistochemistry, and in vitro phosphorylated substrates by immunoprecipitation. Regardless of age, 125I-insulin binding to IR was five times higher in crypt cells than in villus cells and two times higher in the ileum than in the jejunum. In concordance, both alpha- and beta-IR subunits were more abundant in immature than in mature membranes. By immunoprecipitation, the 60-kDa signal was rapidly detected as a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, expressed in mature and immature membranes, and identified as a receptor substrate phosphorylated in vitro by the IR tyrosine kinase. In conclusion, 1) increased responsiveness of rat immature enterocytes to insulin could be related to high membrane concentrations of IR and 2) normal rat enterocytes express a 60-kDa phosphotyrosine protein identified as a direct substrate of the IR tyrosine kinase.", "SV40 TAg(Wt) induced, pRB-dependent, re-entry into the cell cycle is not associated with the acquisition of IR-stimulated apoptosis 4 h or 24 h after 6 Gy or 12 Gy of gamma-irradiation. Co-expression of SV40 TAg(Wt) and K-ras(val12) produces dysplasia in cycling villus enterocytes but no shift towards apoptotic responsiveness to IR. This effect is only manifest after IR and, based upon results obtained with mutant SV40 TAgs, depends upon reaching a critical level of proliferation in villus enterocytes. Like the normal crypt response to IR, the villus-derived enhancement of IR-stimulated crypt apoptosis is associated with an induction of p53 and Raf-1, and is dependent upon p53. Unlike the normal crypt response to IR, the p53 induction involves cells distributed throughout the crypt and the apoptotic response is not confined to the lower half of the crypt. These results indicate that signals initiated by cycling enterocytes can be transmitted to the crypt epithelium to induce p53 and influence their IR-induced apoptosis.", "Decreased EAAT2-IR was associated with decreased GT activity. EAAT2-IR inversely correlated with EAAT2 mRNA levels, suggesting that in AD, GT expression alterations occur due to disturbance at the post-transcriptional level. EAAT2-IR was inversely correlated with APP770 mRNA.", "And the underlying mechanism by which androgens impact pregnancy outcomes has not been fully understood [ In this study, we retrospectively analysed the clinical data of cervical incompetence patients treated at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking University Third Hospital during the last 7 years to explore the clinical characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of cervical incompetence patients, particularly cervical incompetence patients with PCOS, IR and HA. Then, we divided the patients with PCOS into IR and non-IR groups and compared their clinical characteristics. In the PCOS group, the average onset gestational age and termination gestational age were significantly lower ( The pregnancy outcomes of the 178 included patients Women in PCOS group were further divided into co-morbid IR and non-IR groups for comparison. Among the 80 PCOS patients, 45 cases (56.3 %) had the co-morbidity of IR. For the IR group, the onset gestational age and termination gestational age were significantly lower ( Pregnancy outcomes of the PCOS group Pregnancy outcomes of the PCOS group To detect whether there were potential confounding factors in our study, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted with miscarriage as the dependent variable and PCOS, DM/GDM, ART, age, BMI and onset gestational age as the independent variables. PCOS patients with an IR co-morbidity exhibited earlier onset and termination gestational age. In our study, PCOS patients with an IR co-morbidity exhibited earlier onset gestational age and earlier termination gestational age, indicating that these women warrant more aggressive treatment to prevent cervical incompetence, such as beginning monitoring at an earlier gestational age and increasing the monitoring frequency. We speculate that the high incidence of miscarriage in PCOS patients with the co-morbidity of IR maybe due to the following factors: IR may aggravate PCOS conditions, and IR may induce a glucose metabolism disorder that directly affects cervical incompetence, resulting in an adverse outcome. More research is needed to clarify the mechanisms through which IR increases the incidence of miscarriage. Second, our hospital does not routinely screen for IR in women without PCOS; therefore, we did not have data regarding IR in non-PCOS patients. Thus, we cannot conclude whether the effect of IR on pregnancy outcomes is dependent on PCOS. We found that patients with cervical incompetence and PCOS exhibited a poor prognosis and that the prognosis was even worse for patients with the additional co-morbidity of IR. Thus, in the clinic, early monitoring and early therapy will help to improve the prognosis of patients with both PCOS and IR.", "IR is associated with reduced eNOS expression and exacerbated by superimposed stress. Our aim was to assess hepatic expression of iNOS, eNOS, and NOSTRIN in IR with or without N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or thymoquinone (TQ) pretreatment and to compare their hepatoprotective effects. Surgical induction of IR was performed by occlusion of hepatic pedicle for 30 min with mini-clamp and reperfused for 30 min.", "", "Characterization of conformational changes in proteins can be carried out using IR scanning near-field optical microscopy (IR-SNOM). SNOM has been previously applied in the identification of spectroscopic signatures in a variety of solid state and polymer samples, including direct imaging of plasmon propagation on graphene Here, we show electron-induced nanoscale structural transitions in silk proteins revealed by near-field IR imaging and nano-spectroscopy at resolutions approaching the molecular level. The applied electron dosage is the primary tuning parameter and plays a more important role than the crystallinity of the starting materials ( In this work, SNOM has been utilized to overcome the diffraction limits of conventional optics and register nanoscale spectroscopic signatures of silk in the IR frequencies. To obtain high-resolution optical images and spectroscopic information to map out the nano-chemical and nano-mechanical properties of silk proteins at the molecular level, an s-SNOM (NeaSNOM, Neaspec GmbH, Germany) is coupled to a tunable IR quantum cascade laser (QCL, Daylight Solutions Inc., USA) covering the broad IR spectra of the amide I and II bands over the range from 1,495 to 1,790 cm To explore the nanoscale conformational transition of silk proteins (with emphasis on the secondary structure of \u03b2-sheets), we prepared a set of silk fibroin samples on silicon substrates using EBL which offers the highest lithographic resolution at the nanoscale. A set of thin silk films with a thickness of \u223c150 nm were spin-coated and crosslinked using methanol for crystallization (that is, the formation of \u03b2-sheets from random coils) At the dosage of 8,000 \u03bcC cm To quantitatively confirm the conformational transition and acquire unambiguous structural identification of each stage, we performed an IR nano-spectroscopy study of the electron-induced structural transitions of silk proteins using AFM\u2013IR with a spatial resolution of \u223c20 nm (Anasys Instruments, USA) As shown in The ability to structurally characterize the material allows us to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of silk proteins for 3D nanostructuring. We found that there is a significant difference in the kinetics of protein\u2013electron interactions between amorphous silk (random coil dominated) and crystalline silk (\u03b2-sheet dominated) ( As revealed by near-field IR imaging and nano-spectroscopy, the interaction between the electron beam and the silk structure critically depends on the structural conformation on the protein matrix and as-applied electron dosage ( Several examples were fabricated as the first proof-of-principle demonstrations ( This comprehensive investigation of the electron-beam induced conformal modification of silk at the nanoscale using IR near-field optics, allows the characterization of the structural transitions of silk proteins upon electron irradiation. For most samples shown in this work, the doses used varied from 0 to 8,000 \u03bcC cm We utilized a commercially available scattering-type near-field microscope (s-SNOM, Neaspec GmbH, Germany) with a QCL IR laser (MIRCat, Daylight solutions Inc., USA) that is tunable between 1,495 and 1,790 cm The IR spectrum was acquired using an AFM\u2013IR system (Anasys Instruments, CA, USA). It allows high spatial and spectral resolution IR absorption measurement using a combination of AFM and IR laser source. The AFM measures the local thermal expansion of the sample due to the absorption of IR laser, and thereby maps material absorption as a function of wavenumber. Topography images were scanned before the IR spectra measurement to precisely locate the point of interest. Raschke (JILA, University of Colorado, USA) for their support on IR nano-spectroscopic measurements.", "However, the precise mechanisms on IR induced by adipose tissue changes during CUG remain unresolved. Peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) and fat-specific protein 27 (FSP27) expression level in epididymal adipose tissues (EAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissues (SAT) were detected along with other IR indicators. Relative insufficiency of FSP27 expression in EAT results in a decrease in lipid storage capacity, causing a series of path physiological changes that led to the formation of IR. Resveratrol inhibited the expression of PPAR-\u03b3 and promoted FSP27 expression, thus fundamentally improving IR. The imbalance between adipose synthesis and storage mediated by PPAR-\u03b3 / FSP27 in the EAT plays a pivotal role in the formation of IR during CUG. The first was to explore the mechanism of IR induced by adipose tissue, including changes in PPAR-\u03b3/FSP27 ratio and relevant indicators of IR during CUG process. Finally, we assessed the role of expression imbalance between adipose synthesis and storage mediated by PPAR-\u03b3/FSP27 in the formation of IR in CUG model. The tissues were then embedded in paraffin, cut into 4 Enzyme activity assay of SIRT1 was carried out using a commercial kit (Genmed Scientifics) as described before [ Total RNA was extracted from the epididymal and subcutaneous adipose tissue using Trizol reagent (RNAiso\u2122 Plus, TaKaRa Code D9108B, Japan) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. \u00a7 The R4 rats showed more than a 30 % increase ( Alteration SIRT1 activity in epididymal ( Comparisons of the expression data (2Ct-values) in adipose tissue. Adiponectin and TNF-\u03b1 levels changed inversely during CUG ( Adipose tissue is an important metabolic organ that is crucial for whole-body insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis, and IR states. Compared to other parts adipose tissue of the body, visceral adipose tissue plays an important role in IR [ In our study, 4-week diet restriction made the body weight of rats decrease significantly compared with the NC4 group. In this study, the evidence of decreased steady-state GIR during the clamp in the RN8 group and significantly increased fasting insulin levels with normal fasting glucose concentration confirmed the presence of systemic IR. Elevated levels of lipids such as FFAs and triglycerides are a key reason for the incidence of IR [ Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol produced by plants in response to environmental stress [ As noted above, adipose synthesis was in parallel with storage during CUG with resveratrol intervention, and systemic IR was improved as shown by decreased FINS levels and increased steady-state GIR in RN8E group. The excessive lipid could not be stored properly, resulting in lipid spillover and causing IR. The imbalance between adipose synthesis and storage mediated by PPAR-\u03b3/FSP27 may serve as a new molecular target for the treatment of IR and related diseases. This provides a potential treatment for IR.", "This study aimed to evaluate atorvastatin effects on lipid, adipokine, IR, and inflammatory statuses in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) in an in-hospital setting. Atorvastatin administered early on during hospitalization to patients with MI contributed to the improvement of lipid, adipokine and pro-inflammatory statuses and decreased IR. These mechanisms involve the activation of local and progressive inflammatory processes in the atherosclerotic plaque concurrent with endothelial dysfunction, which subsequently contribute to the development of MI (Cefalu, Taking into account that one of the major causes of cardiovascular diseases is high circulating and tissue cholesterol levels, drugs that not only improve impaired lipid transport, but also exert beneficial effects on markers of atherothrombosis, IR, and inflammation are necessary. Proinflammatory factors (interleukin-6, IL-6; eBioscience, Vienna, Austria) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (Biomerica, Irvine, CA, USA) were assessed using standard test kits (CV, 7.03\u20138.99%, and CV, 2.3-4.1%) Serum glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels were measured to assess carbohydrate metabolism and to diagnose IR. The homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) index was calculated on days 1 and 12 after MI onset. A HOMA-IR value > 2.77 was established as the cut-off value indicating IR. Atorvastatin therapy (Group 1) resulted in a decrease in leptin levels by 40.3% and was significantly lower compared with the patients in Group 2 (Table The results of the carbohydrate metabolism assessment are presented in Table Statistically significant differences with the control group, (p < 0.05); Statistically significant differences in parameters between Group 1 and 2 on day 12, (p < 0.05); Despite the fact that insulin levels did not vary significantly during the follow-up period, the integral index of IR, HOMA-IR, had undergone significant changes. On day 1, HOMA-IR index increased 1.3-fold in Group 1 and 1.5-fold in Group 2 compared with the control group. The 12 day atorvastatin treatment showed a significant decrease in HOMA-IR by17.4% (2.1 [2.2;3.1]); its value decreased to normal. Group 2 patients who did not receive statins demonstrated elevated HOMA-IR, indicating the presence of moderate IR. Those treated with atorvastatin resulted in a decrease of FFA and TAG levels (Rodr\u00edguez-Calvo et al., Elevated FFA levels are now regarded as a marker of IR (Dresner et al., In recent years, the roles of adipokines, leptin, and adiponectin have been actively discussed in the development of MI and its complications. It is hypothesized that hyperleptinemia is concurrent with the development of IR, and thus, causes pathological changes in the cardiovascular system (Martin et al., Perhaps this is due to the effect of atorvastatin on balance adipoktine /fibroblast growth factor. PAI-1 is considered to be a risk factor for atherothrombosis and MI, as well as a marker of IR, according to the results of current studies (Gotto et al., The effects of treatment with atorvastatin 20 mg/day were shown during the early recovery period among patients with MI. In addition to its lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory effects, statin therapy reduced the severity of IR, based on reduced levels of FFA, IL-6, PAI-1, and improved adipokine status.", "This study observed macroglial cell activation, and in particular, astrocyte activation, after the release of TNF\u03b1 and other necroptosis factors in the rat retina due to IR. IR was induced in the retinas of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by increasing the intraocular pressure to 160 mmHg and then allowing reperfusion. In addition, to inhibit necroptosis, Nec-1 (necrostatin-1) was injected intravitreally after IR. Cell death in the IR-injured retinas was identified by cell counting. TNF\u03b1, RIP1, RIP3, and inactive caspase 8 were mainly expressed in the GCL after IR, as determined by IHC and WB. Nec-1 inhibited RIP1, a necroptosis factor, indicating protection against retinal cell loss after IR injury. We showed that IR injury triggered increases in both activation of astrocytes and the expression of TNF\u03b1. In addition, TNF\u03b1, which was activated by IR, triggered the release of necroptosis factors, particularly, in GCL. Inhibition of necroptosis using Nec-1 decreased the level of RIP1 and retinal cell loss in IR-injured retinas.", "GANT61 (10 \u03bcM) in combination with IR resulted in a decreased cell survival in all cell lines although only significant for 22Rv1 cells (Figure ( Next, we aimed to elucidate whether the radiosensitizing effect of GANT61 in the 22Rv1 cells was mediated by its effect on GLI1 since this is the main activator of Hh signaling. Induction of DNA double strand breaks (DSB) immediately after IR, as indicated by \u03b3H2AX expression, was similar after IR or of IR in combination with GANT61. However, the combination treatment resulted in a significant delay in reduction in \u03b3H2AX expression indicating a reduction in DNA damage repair at 8 and 24 hours after IR in all three cell lines (Figure ( Furthermore, the combination of GANT61 and IR in the 22Rv1 cells was associated with a significant increase of the sub-G1 fraction compared to either single treatment groups (Figure These data indicate that inhibition of Hh signaling at the level of GLI1 increased the intrinsic radiosensitivity of 22Rv1 cells mainly through effects on cell cycle and apoptosis rather than DNA damage repair which was altered in all of the cell lines. Both PC3 and DU145 cells harbor mutations in p53 whereas 22Rv1 cells have functional p53 [ ( Next, the therapeutic potential of GANT61 in combination with IR was examined ( Immunohistochemical analysis of the PCa xenograft tumors for Ki67 expression, which is a marker for proliferation potential, showed that GANT61 decreased Ki67 expression ( To further characterize the effect of GANT61 in the tumors, we performed qPCR analysis using specific human and murine primers to distinguish the effect on the tumor cells and surrounding stromal cells, respectively. We were able to demonstrate that GANT61 alone or in combination with IR significantly reduced gene expression of the main Hh target genes GLI1, GLI2 and PTCH1 in the tumor cells, but also in the surrounding stroma (Figure In this study, we investigated the combination of Hh inhibition and radiotherapy in several PCa models both While several studies have already demonstrated that there might be a link between Hh signaling and radiation resistance, the specific mechanisms involved are not completely understood.", "Inasmuch as several proteins of the DNA damage response machinery are Hsp90 clients, the functional consequences of Hsp90\u03b1 phosphorylation following IR have implications for the design of novel radiosensitizing agents that specifically target the Hsp90\u03b1 isoform. Here we show that ATM phosphorylates Hsp90\u03b1 at the T5/7 residues immediately after IR. Although Hsp90\u03b1 is located in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, only nuclear Hsp90\u03b1 is phosphorylated by ATM after IR. The siRNA mediated knockdown of Hsp90\u03b1 sensitizes head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells, lung cancer cells and lung fibroblasts to IR. Thus, this study provides evidence that Hsp90\u03b1 is a component of the signal transduction events mediated by ATM following IR, and that Hsp90\u03b1 loss decreases \u03b3H2AX levels. Figure ( Given that \u03b3H2AX is important for the formation of repair foci following DNA damage, we sought to determine if \u03b3H2AX levels are affected following IR in Hsp90\u03b1 deficient cells. In Figure ( In the present study, we show that IR induces Hsp90\u03b1 threonine 5 and 7 phosphorylation by ATM and that Hsp90\u03b1 deficiency reduces \u03b3H2AX levels and sensitizes cells to IR. This work provides evidence that Hsp90\u03b1 is a component of the complex signaling cascade mediated by ATM and is directly involved in the DNA damage response following IR. We demonstrate that ATM plays a major role in the threonine 5 and 7 phosphorylation of Hsp90\u03b1 following IR of AT5BIVA cells. [ The phosphorylation of Hsp90\u03b1 on threonine 5 and 7 was observed in all the cell lines used here as well as in studies previously published [ Our study supports further research into the implications of Hsp90\u03b1 threonine 5 and 7 phosphorylation upon IR and other DNA damaging agents.", "Plasmonic metamaterial absorbers (PMAs) can impart wavelength or polarization selectivity to conventional thermal IR detectors simply by controlling the surface geometry of the absorbers to produce surface plasmon resonances at designed wavelengths or polarizations. We review our recent advances in wavelength- and polarization-selective thermal IR sensors using PMAs for multi-color or polarimetric imaging. Our wavelength- or polarization-selective uncooled IR sensors using various PMAs and multi-color image sensors are then described. These advanced functional thermal IR detectors with wavelength or polarization selectivity will provide great benefits for a wide range of applications. First, thermal IR sensors are briefly introduced. Recently, IR absorbers using plasmonics and metamaterials have been widely studied not only for uncooled IR sensors but also for IR emitters and radiative cooling. These absorbers are referred to by various names such as plasmonic absorbers, metamaterial absorbers, plasmonic metamaterial absorbers, metasurface absorbers or perfect absorbers [ Crystal-type absorbers are also called plasmonic crystals and have periodic dimpled structures, which are analogous to photonic crystals [ MIM-type PMAs (MIM-PMAs) are the most widely studied structures for a wide wavelength range covering the visible to the microwave [ Mushroom-type PMAs (MR-PMAs) consist of a bottom reflector and top isolated micropatches that are connected through posts [ We have developed wavelength-selective uncooled IR sensors using Au-based 2D-PAs [ Various sensors with different 2D-PA structures were fabricated on the same wafer. This geometric asymmetry in the absorber surface plane produces asymmetric behavior for the incident IR rays, which enables polarization-selective detection. It is critical to select appropriate PMAs for thermal IR detectors considering the field of application, number of pixels, cost and type of integrated system. We reviewed the recent advances of our wavelength- and polarization-selective thermal IR detectors using plasmonics and metamaterials technologies. The basics of thermal IR detectors were introduced. Our developed wavelength-selective uncooled IR sensors, multi-color IR image sensors, and polarization-selective uncooled IR sensors were described. These advanced functional thermal IR detectors with wavelength or polarization selectivity will contribute to expand IR sensor applications and provide great benefits to our society over a wide range of applications, such as fire detection, gas analysis, material identification, and object recognition.

However, when the brain concentrations were corrected for their respective area under the blood concentration-time curve, only [ 14 C]sucrose showed significantly higher (30%) BBB permeability values in the IR animals. Because [ 13 C]sucrose is a more specific BBB permeability marker, these data indicate that our animal model of hepatic IR injury does not affect the BBB tight junction permeability to small, hydrophilic molecules.", "We hypothesized that inhibiting the activity of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), the major negative regulator of the IR, specifically in macrophages, would have beneficial anti-inflammatory effects and lead to protection against atherosclerosis and CVD.", "Imbalance between anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory response contributes to the origins and drivers of IR. However, cells of innate and adaptive immune system participate in the pathogenesis of IR, while glucose homeostasis related immune tolerance could be compromised high fat diet (HFD) reduced metabolic disorder. Although previous studies have demonstrated that anti-inflammatory therapy has a protective role in alleviating the pro-inflammatory status in HFD induced IR, the precise mechanism is still unclear. In the present study, we initially perform a novel research on the relationship between Poly (I:C) preconditioning and improved glucose metabolism in obesity related IR. Overall, selectively targeting precise immune regulators may lead to new classes of potentially meaningful therapies for IR in the clinical trials.", "An important and very compelling finding stemming from the insulin infusion studies is the extensive metabolomic characterization of the effects of fasting duration (and thus IR-like condition) on the cellular responses to insulin. Given insulin\u2019s profound effects on perturbing metabolic pathways in elephant seal pups, this may partially explain the natural decrease in plasma insulin as an evolved adaptation to prolonged fasting as a means to: The increase in baseline free fatty acid values in late fasting, along with the concomitant decrease in primary carbon metabolites, is indicative an insulin resistance-like (IR-like) phenotype. Additionally, the unique metabolic network constructed for seals here provides a framework to differentiate reversible, long-term IR-like phenotype and true insulin resistance. Similar to IR, the IR-like phenotype observed in seals is characterized by elevated plasma FFA and glucose levels. However, this unique response is likely an evolved adaptation to facilitate the development of an IR-like phenotype that is not associated with detrimental outcomes. Collectively, these data define an IR-like phenotype that may characterize an intermediary phenotype and differentiate it from the human condition, which is associated with severe metabolic derangements and consequences, and the current condition, which is evolved and a natural component of the animal\u2019s life history and absent of irrecoverable metabolic detriments.", "SMARCAD1 is recruited to DSB sites via its CUE domain recognizing H2A mono-ubiquitylation by BRCA1-BARD1 E3 ligase complex, resulting in repositioning of 53BP1 within ionizing radiation induced foci (IRIF) and efficient DNA-end resection . In addition, while USP3 depletion resulted in delayed disappearance of ubiquitylaed H2A and FK2 staining (poly-ubiquitylation marker) after IR, over-expression of USP3 suppressed ubiquitylation of \u03b3H2AX, suggesting that USP3 may target both of H2A and \u03b3H2AX . carried out DUB over-expression based screen employing IR-induced 53BP1 foci formation as a readout and found that USP44 antagonizes 53BP1 foci formation and is recruited to site of damage in the downstream of RNF8 and RNF168. USP34 also associates and stabilizes RNF168 especially after IR, thereby enhancing H2A and \u03b3H2AX ubiquitylation. Interestingly, USP34 is localized to IRIF depending on RNF8, RNF168 and also 53BP1, suggesting there might be other substrates of USP34 at DSB flanking region . In line with this notion, BAP1 depletion resulted in reduced localization of RPA, RAD51 and BRCA1 to IRIF or microlaser irradiation site , although it remains ambiguous whether either histone H2A deubiquitylation or INO80 stabilization by BAP1 accounts for these phenotypes. Furthermore, UCHL3 depletion resulted in the reduced RAD51 foci formation after IR, although RPA and BRCA1 foci formation were unaffected, indicating that UCHL3 would function after DNA-end resection. Furthermore, because local concentration of DUBs will affect the ubiquitylation status of target proteins, super-resolution microscopy analysis of DUBs within a single IRIF will give a clue for functional diversity of them.", "These factors are characterized by a leucine zipper protein-protein dimerization domain, as well as CnC and basic domains that confer DNA binding activity [ It is generally accepted that exposure to IR can produce radical oxygen species (ROS), including hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, which contribute to cell and tissue injury. These DNA damages caused by hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide and superoxide as a secondary consequence of IR, can induce cell apoptosis [ It was reported that the activation of Nrf2 mitigated radiation-induced lung injury [ To investigate whether Nrf2 has radioprotective effect in vivo, we first analysed the 30-day survival of In addition, the 30-day survival of To investigate the immune function of To evaluate the blood system of We further evaluated the effect of Nrf2 on the DNA damage to peripheral blood lymphocytes from To determine the effect of IR induces apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells, which is p53 dependent [ To explore nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) role in the protection effect of When it is activated under stress situations, NF-\u03baB p65 immigrates from the cytoplasm into the nuclei of cells.", "Group II (IR; n=7): Following laparotomy and 45 minutes of left renal pedicle occlusion, 4 hours of reperfusion was performed. Group III (IR+D; n=7): Following laparotomy and ischemia, dexmedetomidine was administrated intraperitoneally (100 \u00b5g/kg) at fifth minute of reperfusion. Group IV (RIPC+IR; n=7): Under anesthesia, 3 cycles of ischemic preconditioning were applied to the left hind leg, and after 5 minutes, renal IR was performed. Total renal injury score of IR group was significantly higher than IR+D and RIPC+IR groups (p<0.01). In the present study, it was demonstrated histomorphologically that both dexmedetomidine and RIPC decreased renal IR injury significantly.", "Although several studies have reported an association of the NLRP3 inflammasome with obesity and/or IR; contradictory results were also reported by other studies. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to summarize results of studies that evaluated the association of the NLRP3 with obesity and IR. Overall, human studies indicate that obesity and IR are associated with increased NLRP3 expression in AT. Hence, Nlrp3 blockade in mice protects against HFD-induced obesity and IR. In conclusion, available studies strongly points for an association between NLRP3 inflammasome and obesity/IR.", "The need of the hour is to identify fructose-induced IR as an unique pathological state to be managed differentially. Summarily, when results from fructose- and glucose-rich environment were compared, then (1) IR was more pronounced in former; (2) AM performed better in former; (3) metformin and pioglitazone were equivocal in either; (4) rutin and quercetin showed deviant effects from AM; and lastly (5) effects of rutin were closer to AM than quercetin. We hypothesize that AM ameliorates fructose-induced IR through a mechanism which is distinct from standard drugs and not shared by individual phytoconstituents in toto.", "", "The present study aims to evaluate the effect of AD on IR and anti-arthritis in collagen-induced arthritic (CIA) rats. AD reduced both serum fasting glucose, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1 and IR.", "Elevated values of \u03b3GT ( IR was evaluated regarding the presence or absence of mutations at Besides, all mutations were analyzed as dependent variables in a univariate model with biochemical, virological, and demographic data (data not shown). Conversely, The lack of association of these mutations in the present study could be due to the prevalence of obese patients in Brazil compared to Japan that could interfere in the prevalence of IR. The standard definition of overweight is BMI 25.0\u201329.9 kg/m The IR prevalence was 42.5%, similar to previous studies (44.1%) in HCV patients [ The presence of core amino acid Q in position 70 was associated with low concentrations of vitamin D. In obese subjects, the endocrine system with insufficient vitamin D concentration is characterized by high PTH level and 1,25(OH) Vitamin D can affect insulin response to glucose directly or indirectly [ This study presents some limitations as the small number of treated patients, lack of information regarding ethnicity, and genetic background and the small number of samples studied from each genotype group. The absence of an association between mutations in HCV Between 2011 and 2012, a total of 92 serum samples were collected from CHC patients residing in Rio de Janeiro that were referred to Viral Hepatitis Ambulatories in Rio de Janeiro (Oswaldo Cruz Institute, FIOCRUZ; Gaffree and Guinle University Hospital, UNIRIO and Clementino Fraga Filho University Hospital, UFRJ). After translation of nucleotide sequence into amino acids, protein sequences were evaluated in VESPA software to detect signatures or residues with different frequencies in the two sets of sequences (with and without IR).", "One peak suppresses the scattering signals used by laser-guided missiles, and the other matches the atmospheric absorption band, thereby enabling the suppression of long-wavelength IR (LWIR) and mid-wavelength IR (MWIR) signals from objects as they propagate through the air. The proposed absorber was able to reduce the scattering of 1.54 \u03bcm IR laser light by more than 90% and suppress the MWIR and LWIR signatures by more than 92%, as well as maintain MWIR and LWIR signal reduction rates greater than 90% across a wide temperature range from room temperature to 500 \u00b0C. The detector observes infrared, radar, and acoustic signals reflected by or emitted from the targets Research on the development of frequency-selective devices using MIM structures for stealth technology applications Since the IR perfect absorber using an MIM structure increases the IR signature of target objects by enhancing their thermal radiation, the applications of perfect absorbers in IR stealth technology have not been generally accepted. In previous studies, IR perfect absorbers were developed for the application to IR radiation sources rather than to IR stealth technology Surface property modifications have also been studied to enable the suppression of IR signatures of objects and the development of IR stealth technology In the present work, we propose a dual-band metamaterial perfect absorber with an MIM structure for use in IR stealth technology. It is a perfect absorber at a wavelength of 1.54 \u03bcm and can thereby reduce the IR signatures used by laser-guided missiles. The perfect absorber also has a broad absorption peak that matches the atmospheric absorption band, and enables the attenuation of IR signatures as they propagate through the air. This structure reduces the scattering of IR laser beams from surfaces, thereby suppressing the IR signatures that would guide laser-guided missiles to their targets. However, to avoid enhancing the IR signature in the short-wavelength IR (SWIR) range of 1\u20133 \u03bcm, it was necessary to make the spectral bandwidth of the metamaterial perfect absorber as narrow as possible. To retain the IR stealth functionality of the absorber at various incident angles, the SPP resonance peak needed to be kept exactly at the wavelength of the laser beam (1.54 \u03bcm). In addition to SPPs, the magnetic polaritons (MPs), which arise from the coupling between external electromagnetic fields and magnetic resonances inside structures, can be excited by laser beams in MIM structures To realize a dual-band perfect absorber for use in IR stealth technology, we designed the MIM structure to yield an additional resonance peak in the mid-wavelength IR (MWIR) range, which is within the strong absorption band of water in the atmosphere. Calculated absorptivities and wavelength shifts of the ( We evaluated the usability of the proposed absorber in IR stealth technology in two wavelength ranges\u2014the MWIR wavelength range from 3 \u03bcm to 5.5 \u03bcm and the LWIR wavelength range from 8 \u03bcm to 14 \u03bcm\u2014since IRST detectors employ the signatures of objects in these wavelength ranges. In the calculations, we assumed that the IR signature from the object was defined by the thermal radiation transmitted at a horizontal distance of 1 km through the atmosphere at ground level. Usability of the dual-band metamaterial perfect absorber in IR stealth technology. ( To evaluate the usability of the perfect absorber in IR stealth technology, we calculated the reduction rate of the IR signature of blackbody radiation by using the perfect absorber. The period of disk To fabricate the dual-band perfect absorber using a single lithography step, we analysed the usability of the IR stealth technology. In terms of the availability of the dual-band perfect absorber in IR stealth technology, the most important difference between the two designs is the incident angle dependence of absorption in the 1.54 um band. For the laser-guided missile, in which the receiver and detectors are combined, the dependence of the performance of the IR stealth technology on the incident angle is negligible We have proposed a dual-band metamaterial perfect absorber for use in IR stealth technology. The perfect absorber has a narrow IR absorption band at 1.54 \u03bcm to suppress the scattering signals used by laser-guided missiles and a broad thermal radiation band at 6.2 \u03bcm to reduce the MWIR and LWIR signatures by employing atmospheric absorption. We minimized the wavelength shift of the narrow IR absorption peak at 1.54 \u03bcm via variations in the incident angle of light by exciting SPPs using the Bloch-wave condition and the MPs of the disks simultaneously, while maintaining a high absorption peak. We also evaluated the usability of the dual-band metamaterial perfect absorber in IR stealth technology. The absorber was able to reduce the scattering of a 1.54 \u03bcm IR laser light by more than 90%. Furthermore, the MWIR and LWIR signatures could be suppressed by more than 92% using the dual-band perfect absorber and were reduced by at least 90% across a wide temperature range, from room temperature to 500 \u00b0C.", "Currently, the roles of microRNAs in the IR are still under investigated. Here, we show that endogenous miR-200c expression is stimulated by IR in rat heart. Moreover, the glutamine metabolism is suppressed by IR in rat heart. Notably, the miR-200c inhibitor-pretreated rat heart exhibits improved heart function in IR. This study reports an important function of miR-200c in the regulation of glutamine metabolism during ischemia/reperfusion injury and will contribute to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for the protection of IR.", "", "However, whether and to what degree intracoronary delivery of rTIMP-3 post-IR is feasible and effective remained to be established. LV echocardiography was performed at 3-28 days post-IR, and LV ejection fraction (EF) and LV end-diastolic volume were measured. LV EF fell and LV end-diastolic volume increased from baseline (pre-IR) values (66 \u00b1 1% and 40 \u00b1 1 ml, respectively, means \u00b1 standard deviation) in both groups; however, the extent of LV dilation was reduced in the rTIMP-3 group by 40% at 28 days post-IR ( P < 0.05) and the fall in LV EF was attenuated. Despite equivalent plasma troponin levels (14 \u00b1 3 ng/ml), computed MI size at 28 days was reduced by over 45% in the rTIMP-3 group ( P < 0.05), indicating that rTIMP-3 treatment abrogated MI expansion post-IR.", "Prophylactic treatment with CeO2 nanoparticles (0.5mg/kg i.v (IR+CeO2 group)) 1 hour prior to hepatic ischemia and subsequent reperfusion injury lead to a decrease in serum levels of alanine aminotransaminase and lactate dehydrogenase at 6 hours after reperfusion. However, immunoblotting demonstrated no significant changes in the levels of apoptosis related protein markers such as bax, bcl2 and caspase 3 in IR and IR+ CeO2 groups at 6 hours suggesting necrosis as the main pathway for hepatocyte death. Taken together, these data suggest that CeO2 nanoparticles attenuate IR induced cell death and can be used as a prophylactic agent to prevent hepatic injury associated with graft failure.", "The current study demonstrates that exponentially growing fibroblasts from elderly (old) male donor subjects (70, 72, 78 years) are significantly more sensitive to clonogenic killing mediated by platinum-based chemotherapy and IR, (~70\u201380% killing) relative to young fibroblasts (5 months and 1 year; ~10\u201320% killing) and adult fibroblasts (20 years old; ~10\u201330% killing). Images were pre-processed and mitochondrial morphology was analyzed using an ImageJ macro as previously described ( Skin samples were collected from both IR exposed and control legs of young, adult and old mice through the University of Iowa Comparative Pathology Core. From OCT-frozen mouse skin tissue, 10 \u00b5m sections IR exposed skin was cut and placed on the same slide to control skin for that specific group (For e.g. young control Skin thickness was measured in the tissue slices from young, adult and old mice both from the IR-exposed and control leg.

Western blot revealed that Derlin-1 overexpression upregulated Bcl-2 and AKT phosphorylation (Figure To confirm the involvement of AKT signaling pathway in Derlin-1 induced IR resistance, we adopted AKT inhibitor LY294002. All groups were treated with 4 Gy IR. Using plasmid and siRNA transfection, we observed that Derlin-1 overexpression decreased radiosensitivity while Derlin-1 depletion increased sensitivity to IR. This effect was more obvious in cells treated with higher IR dosage, suggesting IR treatment expanded the role of Derlin-1 on cancer cell survival. Among the mechanisms of IR induced cell death, mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis are the most important ones. AKT activation is involved in the induction of both IR resistance and Bcl-2 [ In summary, for the first time we describe the clinical significance of Derlin-1 in human ESCC.", "For that, we evaluated the capacity of IR to predict an atherogenic lipid subfraction profile. The impact of IR as a predictor of atherogenic lipoproteins was tested by logistic regression analysis in raw and adjusted models. HDL-C and Apo AI were significantly lower in individuals with IR. Individuals with IR had a higher percentage of small HDL particles, lower percentage in the larger ones, and reduced frequency of phenotype A (IR = 62%; non-IR = 83%). IR individuals had reduced probability to have large HDL (OR = 0.213; CI = 0.999\u20130.457) and had twice more chances to show increased small HDL (OR = 2.486; CI = 1.341\u20137.051). IR was a significant predictor of small LDL (OR = 3.075; CI = 1.341\u20137.051) and atherogenic phenotype (OR = 3.176; CI = 1.469\u20136.867). IR, previously DM2 diagnosis, is a strong predictor of quantitative and qualitative features of lipoproteins directly associated with an increased atherogenic risk. Clinically, it was defined as the inability of glucose uptake and utilization by insulin-dependent tissues and reduced insulin sensitivity, being the basis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) [ IR is linked with hypertriglyceridemia and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) [ Recently, Li et al. [ Regarding this background, the aim of this study was to compare the impact of IR effect on lipid metabolism and to evaluate if IR is a predictor of atherogenic lipoprotein profile in Brazilian individuals with IR and without DM2. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level was calculated using the Friedewald equation [ The lipoprotein fractions (VLDL and IDL) and subfractions (HDL and LDL) were determined by the Lipoprint Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS The average age was 51.3 (12.0) years old for the non-IR group and 52.5 (9.3) years old for the IR group. About 60% of the subjects were women, and both groups showed similar frequency of smoking ( HDL-C, APO AI, and LDL size levels were significantly lower in the IR group, which showed a higher TAG/HDL ratio. Over 80% of non-IR subjects exhibited phenotype A versus 62% in the IR group ( The distribution of lipoprotein subfractions ( Presence of IR was associated with reduced chances to have HDL This study showed that IR, without established DM2, is already a predictor of more atherogenic lipoprotein profile, contributing for a worse cardiovascular risk of Brazilian individuals. IR is a key factor for the development of atherosclerosis and DM2, and the most common associated metabolic abnormality is high TAG and low HDL-C levels, whereas TC and LDL-C are not consistently altered [ Lipoproteins are heterogeneous structures, which vary in their size, density, and chemical composition and confer additional value to cholesterol content [ Hypertriglyceridemia is considered the principal lipid abnormality in IR and plays a pivotal role in diabetic dyslipidemia [ Elevated TAG levels are results of increased production and decreased clearance of TAG-rich lipoproteins in both fasting and nonfasting states [ The relationship between HDL size and cardiovascular risk is still a controversial issue. [ Although there were controversial results in the literature, the majority of studies have associated lower concentrations of large HDL with cardiovascular events, dyslipidemia, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes [ Plausible biological mechanisms supporting the role of IR in HDL have been recently reviewed [ In addition of the significant effect of IR on classical lipid profile, VLDL, and HDL subfractions, our data also showed that IR was related with increased chances to have smaller LDL. However, these structural changes were not related with modifications in total APO B and LDL-C levels, confirming that distribution of LDL and particle size adds information to classical evaluation of cholesterol and APO B content in this lipoprotein [ Our results disclose that before DM2 diagnosis, the presence of IR can already cause multiple changes in lipids and structure of lipoproteins and it is supported by the worse LDL phenotype in the IR-group. Classically, two LDL phenotypes, named A and B, based on LDL dense and size are described [ Assessment of IR using the HOMA-IR equation is a simple and nonexpensive tool able to be used in clinical trials and in clinical practice routine. It has a high concordance level with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique, accepted as the gold standard method for IR diagnosis [ Based in these interactions, our odds ratios were adjusted by age and sex; however, few influences were detected by these confounders. The cut-off point used in our study was based on a previous large-population study that included Caucasian (European subjects from 17 cities), Mexican American, and Pima Indian [ Altogether, clinical evaluation of IR can predict future changes in lipid metabolism and its impact in the development of CVD. These results are particularly relevant because they highlight the negative impact of IR, previously DM2 diagnosis, in qualitative aspects of lipid metabolism and cardiovascular risk not described previously in literature. Finally, despite of the robust predictive role of IR on atherogenic lipoprotein profile observed in our study, we assume potential limitations of these results. Third, the criteria used to determine IR were not a gold standard accepted as the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, tolerance test glucose minimal model of Bergman, hyperglycemic clamp, or oral tolerance glucose/meal test. However, our goal was to identify the capacity of IR to predict atherogenic lipoprotein using a fast, simple, and low-cost tool applicable to clinical practice such as HOMA-IR. In conclusion, our results showed that IR is associated with significant changes in quantitative and qualitative aspects of lipoproteins and it is a robust predictor of atherogenic lipoprotein profile in nondiabetic subjects.", "However, medicated serum of WMW restored impaired insulin signaling, upregulated the expression of phospho-IR (pIR), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 subunit, phosphoprotein kinase B, and glucose transporter 4, and decreased IRS serine phosphorylation. Insulin resistance is defined as inability of the cells to reach the normal metabolic level under a certain concentration of insulin stimulation, accompanied by deficiency of IR or the components downstream of IR [ As shown in After treatment with the medicated serum of WMW, palmitate-treated HepG2 cells were stimulated with 100 nM insulin for 15 min; then, the cells were collected for measurement of the expression of insulin signaling-related proteins. Compared to the control group, the expression of pIR in the palmitate-treated group significantly decreased. However, treatment with the medicated serum of WMW remarkably increased IR phosphorylation ( Downstream of PI3K, AKT is a key molecule in the regulation of insulin signaling pathway. The results of western blot analysis of p-IR (a), p-IRS-1 (Ser307) (b), PI3K (p85) (c), p-AKT (d), and GLUT4 (e) are presented by a bar graph.", "We investigated the possible antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effects of fluoxetine (FLX), which used widely as a preoperative anxiolytic, on cardiac injury induced by IR of infrarenal abdominal aorta. FLX was administered to IR (60-min ischemia and 120-min reperfusion) performed rats for 3 days, once daily at 20 mg/kg, i.p. Results were compared to control and non-FLX treated IR performed rats. Serum creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) levels, lipid hydroperoxide, malondialdehyde, and pro-oxidant/antioxidant balance levels in IR group were significantly higher whereas superoxide dismutase activity, glutathione and ferric reducing/antioxidant power levels were lower than control. IR also increased myeloperoxidase activity, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-6 and decreased IL-10 levels. FLX also decreased myeloperoxidase activity, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-6 levels and increased IL-10 levels compared to IR. Our study clearly demonstrates that fluoxetine confers protection against aortic IR-induced cardiac injury and cellular integrity via its antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effects.", "The fly is a particularly interesting model organism with which to examine stem cell survival post IR because recent work has demonstrated that there are several cell populations that display differing levels of resistance to ionizing radiation. Since it has been shown that young GSCs survive exposure to IR and are able to regenerate the germline by one week following exposure to IR ( To assay the general fitness of the 6 week old flies, we compared the survival rates of 6 week old flies, both irradiated and unirradiated. We found no significant difference in the life span of the irradiated and unirradiated flies ( DNA damage can inhibit cell cycle progression ( ( Having identified a regeneration defect in aging GSCs, we next investigated the timing of IR induced cell cycle exit and reentry in young, healthy flies. We visualized branched fusomes and spectrosomes via adducin staining ( ( Bar plot of the average number of GSCs before and one day after IR in nos-Gal4 > Delta flies, reflecting GSC loss one day after IR. ( We next asked what mechanisms are involved in regulating IR-induced quiescence in GSCs. We first probed the role of the G1 checkpoint in IR-induced quiescence by manipulating levels of the p21 ortholog, ( ( ( This suggests that Foxo has been shown to regulate We also probed the role of ( Finally, we probed the question of whether IR-induced quiescence is protective to GSCs. Vials from flies 5\u20137 days post-IR were collected and the number of progeny hatched per female was calculated. In contrast IR triggers a permanent inhibition of germline production in older flies but does not eliminate the GSC, suggesting that there is some form of regulation of exit and re-entry of the cell cycle for young but not older germlines. Following IR exposure Foxo levels increase and inhibit Tor signaling. Tor signaling is required for post-IR treated quiescent GSCs re-entering the cell cycle, while Foxo induces exit into the quiescent state. 3) The loss of GSCs after irradiation in germaria with ectopic Delta ( We have now quantified GSCs loss 1 day following IR in germaria with ectopic \u0394 and added the information in 4) It would be informative if Tie activation could be shown only in cells that border daughters in While this is an important question, at this time Tie activation is difficult to show directly since no reliable 5) The way data are displayed in To provide the opportunity for the reader to determine the decrease in WT GSC with elongated spectrosomes we have now included the data used for the graph in 6) The increase in Foxo staining in We show a high magnification image of 6-week old GSCs stained for Foxo (see 7) The increase in p-S6 staining in We have now quantified the P-S6 increase in FOXO KD vs. control in aged animals. No obvious defects were observed (see 9) In We quantified the offspring of 6-week old Foxo RNAi flies before and after IR. Further points: 1) We have now corrected this statement in the subsection \u201cfoxo represses Tor in GSC after IR\u201d.", "(C, D, G) Quantification from high-throughput microscopy images of the total levels of Cx43 in RPE1 cells upon elevated or reduced IIS, stimulated or not with insulin, IR/IGF1R dual inhibitor (\u201cIR inhib\u201d), protein kinase C (PKC) activator or inhibitor or lysosomal inhibitors (NH Over-expressing Rab5 or Rab7 (which regulate early endosomes or late endosomes-lysosomes formation, respectively) could not revert the phenotypes ( Consistent with our in vitro results, over-expression of Rab4 or Rab11 in the (A and B) Over-expression of Rab4 (wild type [WT]) or Rab11(WT) in the GFS led to increased levels of shaking-B protein (SHAK-B) in the thorax of old flies. Insulin (used at 1 \u03bcM for 1 hour, unless indicated [MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA]), BMS 536924 (called IR inhib in this study and used at 5 \u03bcM [4774; Tocris, Bristol, UK]), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; called PKC active in this study and used at 100 nM for 1 hour [10008014; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI]), G\u00f66983 (called PKC inhib in this study and used at 5 \u03bcM for 1 hour [2285; Tocris]), NH RPE1 cells (ATCC CRL-4000) were maintained at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO All transfections were undertaken using GeneJuice (Millipore) transfection reagent according to the manufactures instructions in 96-well glass bottomed dishes at 100 ng of DNA per 96 well.", "RNA-sequencing studies revealed that most radiation-induced genes were strongly dependent on only one of a small number of sensors and signaling pathways, notably the DNA damage-induced kinase ATM, which regulated many IR-response genes, including interferon response genes, via an atypical IRF1-dependent, STING-independent mechanism. However, the response to higher doses of radiation is now of special interest for the development of strategies to mitigate the negative consequences of radiation therapies and unintended radiation exposures, and to optimize combination cancer therapies in which radiation is combined with other therapeutic approaches, such as checkpoint blockade ( In mammals, the most severe consequences of IR exposure often result from the death of proliferative cells, including radiosensitive bone marrow stem and progenitor cells ( The transcriptional response to IR exposure can be elicited by the sensing of DNA damage, newly generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), or cell death ( The DNA double-strand breaks induced by IR can be sensed by the DNA damage-induced kinases, ATM and DNA-PK ( Although many sensing mechanisms and signaling pathways have the potential to contribute to the IR response, the precise contribution of each mechanism and pathway remains poorly understood. Can the transcriptional output be fully explained by known sensing mechanisms, or do sensing mechanisms, signaling pathways, and transcription factors exist that have not yet been linked to the IR response? Of particular note, a careful comparison of the IR response to the response to lipid A, a microbial inducer of inflammation through TLR4, revealed that the selectivity of the IR response can largely be explained by the induction of p53 and the ROS-induced transcription factor, NRF2. Together, the results provide extensive, unbiased insight into the IR response and identify distinct components of the response that may be susceptible to therapeutic perturbation. For our analysis of the response to IR, we focused on C57BL/6 BMDMs for three reasons. First, macrophages are thought to contribute to IR-induced pathogenesis. Second, an initial analysis of a non-proliferative cell type allowed us to simplify the study, as a proliferating cell type would reveal many genes that are modulated as an indirect consequence of cell-cycle checkpoints; to fully understand the IR response, it is preferable to first dissect components of the response that are independent of the cell-cycle and to then add additional layers of complexity in the future. Of the 9,201 expressed genes, 387 (4.2%) were induced by at least 2-fold (p<0.01, FDR<0.05) ( A dose-response analysis revealed that the number of induced genes was much higher with 6 Gy IR than 2 Gy, whereas the number was only moderately increased with 20 Gy ( The 99 genes that were strongly induced with 6 Gy IR were first grouped according to the time point at which their expression peaked ( IR can lead to the release of DAMPs, which can promote a transcriptional response through TLRs ( A promoter motif analysis revealed a strong enrichment of Interferon-Sensitive Response Elements (ISREs) and Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF) binding motifs in the promoters of LRGs ( To test the role of IFN signaling, WT cells and cells lacking the Type 1 IFN receptor, IFNAR, were collected 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, and 24 hrs after IR, followed by RNA-seq analysis. Although none of the ERGs exhibited IFNAR dependence, 43 of the 48 LRGs exhibited substantially reduced maximum transcript levels (<30% of WT) in the irradiated The strong enrichment of NF-\u03baB motifs in the promoters of ERGs ( One challenge in interpreting the Despite the complexity of the These results support previous evidence that DNA damage is a critical sensor for IR, and that ATM plays a dominant role in the inflammatory response induced by IR in BMDMs. The finding that ATM plays a critical role in the IFN response is interesting to consider in relation to previous findings suggesting that double-strand breaks induced by IR activate an IFN response via the STING pathway ( To examine the role of STING in the radiation response in greater depth, BMDMs from WT and We also examined BMDMs from A closer examination of basal transcript levels for IFNAR-dependent LRGs in the Together, these results suggest that the tonic IFN response observed in cultured BMDMs requires a pathway that includes STING, DNA-PK, and IFNAR, with ATM keeping this tonic IFN response at a low level. Furthermore, despite ATM\u2019s role in suppressing the tonic IFN response, it is critical for the potent induction of IFNAR-dependent genes by IR. We next examined BMDMs deficient in the gene encoding the transcription factor IRF3, which is known to be critical for In contrast to the results obtained with To summarize, these results suggest that IRF1 acts downstream of ATM in response to IR and serves as a direct activator of The above results provide insight into the roles of ATM, IRF1, IFNAR, IRF3, STING, and DNA-PK in regulating LRGs. To better define the requirements for induction of the 51 ERGs, WT macrophages were irradiated in the presence of the ERK inhibitor, PD0325901, and the p38 inhibitor, BIRB0796, either alone or together. ROS are known to be additional sensors of IR exposure ( The transcription factor NRF2 is arguably the most compelling mediator of the anti-oxidant responses ( A major goal is to understand how a transcriptional response is tailored to a stimulus, given that many stimuli induce common pathways such as the NF-\u03baB, MAPK, and IRF pathways. Forty-two of the 51 radiation-induced ERGs, and 45 of the 48 LRGs, were also induced by Lipid A ( Specifically, even though Lipid A was a more potent inducer of most genes that were induced in common by Lipid A and IR ( During a search for factors that may regulate these 8 IR-specific genes (5 ERGs and 3 LRGs), the transcription factor p53 emerged as a candidate due to evidence from ChIP-seq experiments in MEFs that p53 can bind in close proximity to a few of these genes ( To evaluate a possible role for p53 in the radiation response in BMDMs, WT and Taken together, p53 and NRF2 explain the induction of 10 of the 12 IR-specific genes. Genome-wide, only 132 of the 5,495 reproducible ChIP-seq peaks exhibited average scores of 69 or greater, with only 48 of these 132 peaks within 1 kb of a TSS ( Although a large number of sensors, signaling pathways, and transcription factors have been implicated in the response to IR, little information has been available regarding the degree to which each contributes to the transcriptional output. ATM plays a dual role in opposing a tonic IFN response driven by STING, DNA-PK, and IRF3, and in activating IFN responses following IR treatment via IRF1. ROS activation of NRF2 serves as another important IR sensing pathway, although this pathway plays a dominant, non-redundant role at only a small number of potently induced genes. Notably, the NRF2 and p53 target genes account for almost all genes found to be induced in an IR-specific manner in comparison to lipid A. A long-term goal is to understand the regulation of all genes that are induced by IR in a statistically significant manner, which includes many genes induced between 1.5- and 4-fold. Using stringent criteria, we identified a limited but clear set of IR-specific genes. The ROS/NRF2 and p53 pathways accounted for the induction of almost all of these genes, suggesting that they are the most important pathways that account for the specificity of the IR response. Of interest, only 2 of the 6 strongly induced p53 target genes - One of the most surprising findings to emerge from this study was the strong dependence of To conclude, although many questions remain to be answered about the regulation of the 99 potently induced genes that were the focus of this study, as well as the large number of genes that are induced more weakly by IR, the study provides a strong foundation for an understanding of the IR response. Briefly, mice were euthanized by placing in a CO The BMDMs were irradiated on day 6 with 2, 6, or 20 Gy of IR (for 6 Gy, ~1.6 Gy per min with Gulmay X-ray unit). For inhibitor studies, BMDMs were preincubated for 1 hr with ROS scavenger NAC (100 \u00b5M or 1mM, Sigma), ERK inhibitor PD0325901 (5 \u00b5M, Sigma), or p38 inhibitor BIRB0796 (5 \u00b5M, AXON Medchem). ChIP-seq for IRF-1 (Cell Signaling #8478S), IRF-3 (Santa Cruz # sc-9082 X) and Phospho-(ser-15)-p53 (Cell Signaling # 9284S) was performed as described ( Reads were aligned to the mouse genome (NCBI37/mm9 build) with TopHat v1.5 by allowing reads to be aligned once with up to two mismatches per read.

(D) The scatter plot at the left shows the maximum transcript levels for commonly induced ERGs in (A) The heat maps summarize the expression kinetics of the 99 IR-induced genes in BMDMs treated with IR (columns 1\u20136) and Lipid A (columns 7\u201311). (B) The scatter plot shows the maximum transcript level for each of the 99 IR-induced genes in (C) The scatter plot displays the strongest p53 binding site motif score within 1 kb of the TSS for each of the 99 IR-induced genes, along with the p-p53 ChIP-seq peak score within 1 kb of the TSS for each gene. Most IR-induced genes are dominantly regulated by one of a small number of sensors IR and ATM activate an IFN response via an IRF1-dependent, STING-independent pathway The tonic IFN response is activated by STING, DNA-PK, and IRF3, but limited by ATM NRF2 activated by ROS and p53 largely explain the selectivity of the response to IR", "RNA-sequencing studies revealed that most radiation-induced genes were strongly dependent on only one of a small number of sensors and signaling pathways, notably the DNA damage-induced kinase ATM, which regulated many IR-response genes, including interferon response genes, via an atypical IRF1-dependent, STING-independent mechanism. However, the response to higher doses of radiation is now of special interest for the development of strategies to mitigate the negative consequences of radiation therapies and unintended radiation exposures, and to optimize combination cancer therapies in which radiation is combined with other therapeutic approaches, such as checkpoint blockade ( In mammals, the most severe consequences of IR exposure often result from the death of proliferative cells, including radiosensitive bone marrow stem and progenitor cells ( The transcriptional response to IR exposure can be elicited by the sensing of DNA damage, newly generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), or cell death ( The DNA double-strand breaks induced by IR can be sensed by the DNA damage-induced kinases, ATM and DNA-PK ( Although many sensing mechanisms and signaling pathways have the potential to contribute to the IR response, the precise contribution of each mechanism and pathway remains poorly understood. Can the transcriptional output be fully explained by known sensing mechanisms, or do sensing mechanisms, signaling pathways, and transcription factors exist that have not yet been linked to the IR response? Of particular note, a careful comparison of the IR response to the response to lipid A, a microbial inducer of inflammation through TLR4, revealed that the selectivity of the IR response can largely be explained by the induction of p53 and the ROS-induced transcription factor, NRF2. Together, the results provide extensive, unbiased insight into the IR response and identify distinct components of the response that may be susceptible to therapeutic perturbation. For our analysis of the response to IR, we focused on C57BL/6 BMDMs for three reasons. First, macrophages are thought to contribute to IR-induced pathogenesis. Second, an initial analysis of a non-proliferative cell type allowed us to simplify the study, as a proliferating cell type would reveal many genes that are modulated as an indirect consequence of cell-cycle checkpoints; to fully understand the IR response, it is preferable to first dissect components of the response that are independent of the cell-cycle and to then add additional layers of complexity in the future. Of the 9,201 expressed genes, 387 (4.2%) were induced by at least 2-fold (p<0.01, FDR<0.05) ( A dose-response analysis revealed that the number of induced genes was much higher with 6 Gy IR than 2 Gy, whereas the number was only moderately increased with 20 Gy ( The 99 genes that were strongly induced with 6 Gy IR were first grouped according to the time point at which their expression peaked ( IR can lead to the release of DAMPs, which can promote a transcriptional response through TLRs ( A promoter motif analysis revealed a strong enrichment of Interferon-Sensitive Response Elements (ISREs) and Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF) binding motifs in the promoters of LRGs ( To test the role of IFN signaling, WT cells and cells lacking the Type 1 IFN receptor, IFNAR, were collected 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, and 24 hrs after IR, followed by RNA-seq analysis. Although none of the ERGs exhibited IFNAR dependence, 43 of the 48 LRGs exhibited substantially reduced maximum transcript levels (<30% of WT) in the irradiated The strong enrichment of NF-\u03baB motifs in the promoters of ERGs ( One challenge in interpreting the Despite the complexity of the These results support previous evidence that DNA damage is a critical sensor for IR, and that ATM plays a dominant role in the inflammatory response induced by IR in BMDMs. The finding that ATM plays a critical role in the IFN response is interesting to consider in relation to previous findings suggesting that double-strand breaks induced by IR activate an IFN response via the STING pathway ( To examine the role of STING in the radiation response in greater depth, BMDMs from WT and We also examined BMDMs from A closer examination of basal transcript levels for IFNAR-dependent LRGs in the Together, these results suggest that the tonic IFN response observed in cultured BMDMs requires a pathway that includes STING, DNA-PK, and IFNAR, with ATM keeping this tonic IFN response at a low level. Furthermore, despite ATM\u2019s role in suppressing the tonic IFN response, it is critical for the potent induction of IFNAR-dependent genes by IR. We next examined BMDMs deficient in the gene encoding the transcription factor IRF3, which is known to be critical for In contrast to the results obtained with To summarize, these results suggest that IRF1 acts downstream of ATM in response to IR and serves as a direct activator of The above results provide insight into the roles of ATM, IRF1, IFNAR, IRF3, STING, and DNA-PK in regulating LRGs. To better define the requirements for induction of the 51 ERGs, WT macrophages were irradiated in the presence of the ERK inhibitor, PD0325901, and the p38 inhibitor, BIRB0796, either alone or together. ROS are known to be additional sensors of IR exposure ( The transcription factor NRF2 is arguably the most compelling mediator of the anti-oxidant responses ( A major goal is to understand how a transcriptional response is tailored to a stimulus, given that many stimuli induce common pathways such as the NF-\u03baB, MAPK, and IRF pathways. Forty-two of the 51 radiation-induced ERGs, and 45 of the 48 LRGs, were also induced by Lipid A ( Specifically, even though Lipid A was a more potent inducer of most genes that were induced in common by Lipid A and IR ( During a search for factors that may regulate these 8 IR-specific genes (5 ERGs and 3 LRGs), the transcription factor p53 emerged as a candidate due to evidence from ChIP-seq experiments in MEFs that p53 can bind in close proximity to a few of these genes ( To evaluate a possible role for p53 in the radiation response in BMDMs, WT and Taken together, p53 and NRF2 explain the induction of 10 of the 12 IR-specific genes. Genome-wide, only 132 of the 5,495 reproducible ChIP-seq peaks exhibited average scores of 69 or greater, with only 48 of these 132 peaks within 1 kb of a TSS ( Although a large number of sensors, signaling pathways, and transcription factors have been implicated in the response to IR, little information has been available regarding the degree to which each contributes to the transcriptional output. ATM plays a dual role in opposing a tonic IFN response driven by STING, DNA-PK, and IRF3, and in activating IFN responses following IR treatment via IRF1. ROS activation of NRF2 serves as another important IR sensing pathway, although this pathway plays a dominant, non-redundant role at only a small number of potently induced genes. Notably, the NRF2 and p53 target genes account for almost all genes found to be induced in an IR-specific manner in comparison to lipid A. A long-term goal is to understand the regulation of all genes that are induced by IR in a statistically significant manner, which includes many genes induced between 1.5- and 4-fold. Using stringent criteria, we identified a limited but clear set of IR-specific genes. The ROS/NRF2 and p53 pathways accounted for the induction of almost all of these genes, suggesting that they are the most important pathways that account for the specificity of the IR response.

Oxidized cfDNA, like low doses of IR, induces oxidative stress, ROS production, ROS-induced oxidative modifications of nuclear DNA, DNA breaks, arrest of the cell cycle, activation of DNA reparation and antioxidant response, and inhibition of apoptosis. Our studies suggest that oxidized cfDNA is a signaling molecule in the stress signaling that mediates radiation-induced bystander effects and that it is an important component of the development of radioadaptive responses to low doses of IR. Human beings are constantly exposed to background sources of IR both of natural (terrestrial and cosmic) and artificial origin (nuclear energy, nuclear accidents, radiation for medical purposes) [ The effects of information transfer from irradiated (target) cells to adjacent, nontargeted cells (RIBE) have been observed for a number of damaging agents of both physical and chemical nature in many types of eukaryotic cells and cover a variety of physiological effects including genomic instability, cell death, and/or RAR [ Research on the role of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) circulating in the blood of healthy persons and patients has led to the hypothesis that oxidized cfDNA (cfDNAox) released from dying cells could mediate RIBE and RAR, and further information on our own research on this subject can be found here [ Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that have a potential for unlimited division and differentiation into many types of cells. The significance of the observed differences was analyzed with nonparametric Mann\u2013Whitney This study was performed using human MSC lines obtained from different donors and characterized by their CD marker expression ( The concentrations of cfDNA in the growth medium used here are 12 \u00b1 2 ng/ml [ LDIR can lead to death of a part of the cell population during the first min of exposure. We further investigated if the CG-rich oxidized cfDNA penetrates into cells after treating them with 10 cGy of IR. Cells treated by method (1) exhibited weak fluorescence in the cytoplasm, while cells treated by method (2) had a higher level of fluorescence which indicates penetration of the plasmids into the cytoplasm ( As CG-rich oxidized cfDNA penetrates into cells, it might mediate early responses to LDIR (10 cGy). As we showed previously, GC-rich cfDNA can play a role of a signaling molecule in RIBE when lymphocytes from peripheral blood are exposed to LDIR [ cfDNA from medium of cells 15 min after irradiation was added to MSCs. As the cfDNA in these conditions contains a high level of oxidized bases, model fragments of oxidized DNA were prepared ( cfDNAox fragments were prepared by treatment of gDNA with H The effect of cfDNAox, cfDNAoxR, or LDIR on the levels of ROS and DNA breaks was investigated. LDIR induces oxidative stress in cells, increasing ROS production. Intracellular ROS level was assessed using H2DCFH-DA (2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate) [ Increase in ROS production by cfDNAox fragments can be connected with increased expression of The main producer of ROS is the NADPH oxidase family (NOX) that includes And indeed, LDIR and cfDNAox and cfDNAoxR fragments induce a 2\u20132.5-fold increase in The increased level of ROS can induce damage to the cells and cause oxidation of genomic DNA. LDIR, as well as cfDNAox and cfDNAoxR, causes an increase in ROS production that leads to oxidation of nuclear DNA. Since oxidation of DNA can cause single- and double-strand breaks [ Comet assays were performed 5 min and 3 h after exposure to LDIR (10 cGy) or to cfDNAox and cfDNAoxR fragments. Four types of cells were present in control populations: (1) cells without DNA breaks, (2) cells with few DNA breaks, (3) cells with fragmented DNA, and (4) apoptotic cells with very damaged DNA ( DSBs were revealed by immunostaining with antibodies against the histone FACS allows assessing the average amount of H2AX histone in cells, but these numbers do not always reflect the real degree of DNA damage [ Thus, the damage to the cell nuclei that is induced by LDIR can be mediated by oxidized DNA fragments. We researched if the DNA breaks are repaired or that cells with multiple DNA breaks undergo cell death within these 2 h. DNA damage induced by IR activates signaling cascades that control DNA repair [ LDIR or treatment with cfDNAox and cfDNAoxR fragments leads to a 3.5\u20134.5-fold increment in the level of mRNA transcripts from the Thus, DNA breaks activate DNA reparation system in the treated cells. As DNA reparation requires time, we were expecting to see a short-term arrest of the cell cycle after treating cells with LDIR or cfDNAox or cfDNAoxR fragments. We observed a 40\u201360% increase of the level of PCNA 30 min after irradiation or treatment of cells with oxidized cfDNA ( Ten cGy of radiation or addition of cfDNAox and cfDNAoxR fragments to the medium increases the number of cells in G1 and G0/G1 30 min after exposure, and thus, these factors arrest the cell cycle in G1 ( Exposure to LDIR or addition of cfDNAox and cfDNAoxR fragments causes a 1.5\u20132-fold decrease in the level of expression of CCND1 and a 1.5\u20132-fold increase in expression of Thus, DNA damage leads to a short-term arrest of the cell cycle and activation of DNA reparation. To analyze the effect of oxidized DNA fragments on the location of NRF2, antibodies against NRF2 and fluorescence microscopy were used ( We assessed the effect of oxidized cfDNA and LDIR on the survival of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (haMSCs) that were subsequently exposed to irradiation at 2 Gy. MTT tests demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the cell death induced by 2 Gy of irradiation in cells that were pretreated with oxidized cfDNA or preirradiated with 10 cGy ( The predominant hypothesis concerning the origin of cfDNA is that its main source is dead cells [ Increased levels of 8-oxodG in cfDNA can be a sign of oxidative stress, in our case, as a consequence of LDIR. cfDNA from irradiated cells contains significantly larger amounts of the oxidation marker 8-oxodG than cfDNA of control (nonirradiated) cells or cellular DNA of irradiated cells [ A variety of studies concern RIBE and RAR based on various parameters of target and bystander cells [ The goal of this work was to compare the action of model oxidized DNA fragments (cfDNAox) and cfDNA from the medium of irradiated cells (cfDNAoxR) with those of LDIR (10 cGy) on human adipose-derived MSCs, and we obtained hard evidence that their reaction to LDIR can be mediated by oxidized GC-rich cfDNA fragments. Thus, cfDNA fragments are stress signaling molecules that regulate RAR to LDIR. (c) Fluorescence microscopy of irradiated and exposed to cfDNAox MSCs stained with BCL2 (anti-BCL2-antibody and secondary FITC-conjugated antibodies) and DAPI (40\u00d7), (a) A plasmid containing a marker GFP-gene and containing (G)n repeats that are easy to oxidate penetrates into cells treated with 10 cGy of IR (fluorescent microscopy, 40x).", "By constructing an IR-reflective layer on an IR-transparent layer with embedded nanopores, the nanoporous metallized polyethylene textile achieves a minimal IR emissivity (10.1%) on the outer surface that effectively suppresses heat radiation loss without sacrificing wearing comfort. To bridge the gap in theoretical understanding of the required spectral properties for heating textiles, we perform the first heat transfer model analysis for personal heating, which reveals the necessity of low-IR emissivity on the textile outer surface, instead of high IR reflectivity on the inner surface, in suppressing the radiative heat dissipation of clothed human. Furthermore, structural photonic simulation indicates that interconnected nanoporous metallic film has almost 100% IR reflectivity as a solid film, which can thus solve the dilemma between optimal thermal radiation property and good breathability. On the basis of the design guidance from thermal and photonic simulations, we experimentally develop an advanced nanophotonic structure textile by constructing an IR-reflective metallic layer on an IR-transparent PE layer with embedded nanopores that are smaller than the IR wavelength but larger than the water molecule. The resulting nanoporous metallized PE textile achieves a minimal IR emissivity of 10.1% on the non-metallized PE side, and in the meantime maintains good wearability as normal textiles. In previous studies, heat transfer model analysis was developed to evaluate the impact of textile\u2019s IR properties on personal cooling Figure Simulation and fabrication of radiative heating textile. While the pore sizes are still much smaller than the IR wavelength (~ 9 \u00b5m), the nanoPE film is still highly transparent to IR. Therefore, the nanoPE layer can serve as the outer support/protection layer covering the metallic layer to avoid exposure of metal for better durability and appearance, while ensuring the minimal IR emission in conjunction with the metallic layer. As a result, by laminating the nanoporous metallized PE textile on the outside of traditional textile, its minimal IR emissivity can effectively suppress the radiative heat dissipation of the human body to the environment without blocking the transmission of water vapor. The nanoporous metallized PE textile was fabricated by coating nanoporous Ag film on 12-\u00b5m-thick nanoPE (nano-Ag/PE) via a low-cost and scalable electroless plating method The total IR reflectance of the coated nanoporous Ag film was measured using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) equipped with a diffuse gold integrating sphere (Fig. First, the low-IR-emissive nano-Ag/PE textile is laminated on the outside of cotton to most effectively suppress the radiative heat dissipation to the environment. The second advantageous design in cotton/Ag/PE is the use of IR-transparent nanoPE as the protection layer, which can retain the low-IR emissivity of the underlying metallic surface. In contrast, Mylar blanket with the IR-absorbing/emitting PET film facing outwards requires higher set-point (18.1 \u00b0C) than that of reversed Mylar blanket (Mylar blanket_R) with metallic coating on the outside (16.3 \u00b0C). Tunability of IR radiation property and versatile choices of low-cost metals. This textile design achieves a nanoporous metallic coating with high IR reflectivity of 98.5% on IR-transparent nanoPE (96.0%), leading to a low IR emissivity of 10.1% on the textile outer surface. Such a low-IR-emissivity textile enables 7.1 \u00b0C decrease in the set-point of ambient temperature compared to traditional cotton textile, which is the best heating performance ever achieved by all the existing radiative heating textiles. Before electroless plating, the nanoPE surface was modified with polydopamine (PDA) coating for 2 h in an aqueous solution that consists of 2 g l The IR reflectivity ( The skin is simulated by a silicone rubber fiberglass insulated flexible heater (Omega, 72 cm This test procedure is based on ASTM E96 with modification. For coloration with Prussian blue, the PDA-coated nanoPE was first immersed in 0.16 M FeCl We employed rigorous coupled-wave analysis method to simulate the reflection of IR light from the metal coating The data sets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. carried out electroless plating of silver, SEM and FTIR characterizations, thermal measurements and wearability tests. assisted in FTIR and thermal measurements.", "This study also confirms that the findings of relevant cross-sectional studies, which observe an independent positive relationship between the TyG index and incident HTN [ IR has been the significant risk factor for the development of HTN [ Previous epidemiological studies have shown that the TyG index was a well-known predictor for the development of diabetes mellitus [ The major strengths of this study were the 9-year longitudinal population-based study and the large number of the subjects.", "Marked lung edema and inflammation, as assessed by wet/dry weight ratio of the LLL and by MPO activity, respectively, were also observed (Table The effects of the two selective A Activation of A To ascertain whether MRS3558 induced lung protection is mediated by A To determine the role, if any, of MAPK in lungs after IR, we performed Western blot studies with specific phospho-antibodies for ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK.

Here we show that hyperthermia, an effective radiosensitizer, can induce several steps associated with IR signaling in cells. Hyperthermia induces gamma-H2AX foci formation similar to foci formed in response to IR exposure, and heat-induced gamma-H2AX foci formation is dependent on ATM but independent of heat shock protein 70 expression. Similar to IR, hyperthermia also induced MDC1 foci formation; however, it did not induce all of the characteristic signals associated with irradiation because formation of 53BP1 and SMC1 foci was not observed in heated cells but occurred in irradiated cells. Additionally, induction of chromosomal DNA strand breaks was observed in IR-exposed but not in heated cells. These results indicate that hyperthermia activates signaling pathways that overlap with those activated by IR-induced DNA damage. Moreover, prior activation of ATM or other components of the IR-induced signaling pathway by heat may interfere with the normal IR-induced signaling required for chromosomal DNA double-strand break repair, thus resulting in increased cellular radiosensitivity.", "Both MnSOD and p53 were inducible by (60)Co gamma-ray IR (up to 170 AU/mL and 51 AU/mL, respectively) in the BC patient group.

The constitutive expression of all 3 proteins could be a useful biomarker for the presence of BC, but only MnSOD overexpression may be the predictive biomarker for selection of BC patients that would be less susceptible to IR-linked complications.", "In the hippocampus, IR expression was unchanged in CORT-treated rats as compared with vehicle-treated rats. However, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the IR, total Akt levels and total GLUT4 levels were reduced in CORT-treated rats when compared to controls.", "The results indicated that aging was accompanied by a significant decrease in IR tyrosine phosphorylation after insulin stimulation in live and skeletal muscle, which was associated with a significant increase in the activity of protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B. Expression profile of mRNA showed an increased expression of mRNAs for IR and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor in both tissues of calorie-restricted rats, but increased expression of IR mRNA was dissociated with the IR gene product in rats maintained on long-term calorie-restricted diet. IR signaling may play an important role in aging and its retardation by calorie restriction, and normal function of IR in liver and skeletal muscle is required for healthy aging and extending lifespan in mammals.", "To study radiation-induced autophagy with specific molecules, we assessed changes in the expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and its intracellular distribution after IR in comparison with starvation-induced autophagy. First, we showed that IR induced cell cycle arrest and autophagy, but not apoptosis, in human malignant glioma U373-MG cells. Type II LC3, that is specifically associated with the membrane of the autophagosome, increased after IR and amino acid starvation. Furthermore, gammaH2AX foci, that show the extent of DNA double-strand breaks, were more pronounced and prolonged in the cells treated with IR and autophagy inhibitors than in those cells treated with IR only.", "Coincidentally, IR differentially activates expression of the cell cycle inhibitor, p21/WAF1, and the DNA replication protein, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). p21/WAF1 mRNA levels remain elevated through 48 h post-exposure to IR, while PCNA mRNA levels increase transiently at early times. Substitution of the p21/WAF1 site for the resident p53-binding site in the PCNA promoter altered the responses to increasing amounts of p53 or IR in transient expression assays. The p21/WAF1 p53-binding site sustained activation of the chimeric PCNA promoter under conditions (high p53 levels or high dose IR) that the PCNA p53-binding site did not.", "Here, we show that synergy of TRAIL and IR, that is, crosssensitization between TRAIL and IR for induction of apoptosis, entirely depends on Bax proficiency in human DU145 and HCT116 carcinoma cells.

In contrast, TRAIL sensitized for IR-induced apoptosis and vice versa upon reconstitution of Bax expression. This indicates that Bak is not sufficient to mediate crosssensitization and synergism between IR and TRAIL. These data clearly establish distinct roles for Bax and Bak in linking the TRAIL death receptor pathway to the mitochondrial apoptosis signaling cascade upon DNA damage by IR.", "We report here that inhibition of IR-induced activaton of nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) but not of either Akt or MAPK kinase (MEK), increased the radiosensitization of Ki-Ras transformed human prostate epithelial 267B1/K-ras cells. However, translocation of p50/NF-kappaB1 did not occur on exposure to IR, suggesting the cell-specific involvement of p50 in radiation signaling. In addition, proteosome inhibition enhanced the IR-induced degradation of apoptotic protein caspases 8 and 3, with the level of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 being unaffected, suggesting the involvement of an apoptotic process in IR-induced cell death of 267B1/K-ras cells. All these results suggest an application of blocking NF-kappaB activation pathway to the development of anticancer therapeutics in IR-induced radiotherapy of Ki-Ras-transformed cancer cells.", "It is concluded that the DHEA-induced PCOS rat models were similar to those of the patients with PCOS, and the IR was observed. Resistin secreted by adipose tissue may mediate IR in PCOS, and it is likely involved in the pathogenesis and development of PCOS.", "Simultaneously, we measured IR kinase activity in IRs extracted from skeletal muscle obtained by needle biopsy at the end of each clamp. By preserving the phosphorylation state of the receptors as it existed in vivo at the time of biopsy, we could correlate GDR and IR kinase in skeletal muscle. Insulin also increased IR kinase activity; the half-maximal effect occurred at approximately 500-600 microU/ml insulin with a maximal 10-fold stimulation over basal.", "These observations indicate that dephosphorylation of IR and GS can be regulated by [Ca2+]i.", "Diabetes increased adipocyte particulate PTPase activity and enhanced IR dephosphorylation by 75% on the 2nd, 93% on the 14th, and 108% on the 30th day. In summary, diabetes appears to induce tissue-specific changes in PTPase and PSPase activities resulting in significant alterations in dephosphorylation of IR and glycogen synthase.", "Somata and fibers show NGFr-IR within the trigeminal ganglion and the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus. NGFr-IR is also found in fibers within the trigeminal root entry zone, the spinal trigeminal tract, and in fibers and terminals within all the central trigeminal sensory nuclei. The NGFr-IR found within the trigeminal sensory nuclei typically occurs in circumscribed zones that vary in position for the different subnuclei. NGFr-IR is found in the dorsomedial and ventrolateral subdivisions of the main sensory nucleus, in the dorsomedial and occasionally in ventral positions within pars oralis, in dorsal and ventral regions within pars interpolaris, and primarily in outer lamina II with fibers that project to lamina V within pars caudalis/medullary dorsal horn. These results show some overlap with the central distribution of trigeminal primary afferent nociceptive fibers such as those found from the tooth pulp and overlap with the central distribution of such peptides as calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P, but NGFr-IR is more restricted. Thus, it appears that NGFr-IR is associated with the endings of primary afferent fibers in the brain stem, and that these fibers may represent a certain subclass of primary afferent nociceptors. It is speculated that fibers showing NGFr-IR may have the ability to alter their response to peripheral deafferentation when compared to fibers lacking NGFr-IR.", "Our results indicate that in adult human skin 1) a GAP43-IR is morphologically present in epidermal and dermal nerve fibers; 2) a NGFr-IR is associated with neuronal as well as non-neuronal elements of cutaneous nerves; 3) the basal epidermal cell layer expresses a NGFr-IR, which is unevenly distributed according to the different body areas; and 4) there is suggestive evidence for a simultaneous expression of GAP43-, NGFr-, PGP 9.5-, SP-, and CGRP-IR in at least part of the cutaneous nerve fibers. The presence of GAP43-immunoreactive nerve fibers might be a marker of a continuous synaptic remodeling in adult skin, whereas the distribution of the NGFr-IR could be relevant for our understanding of the maintenance of the neuronal-target relationship(s).", "In addition, both 10 microM capsaicin and 100 nM RTX significantly reduced the number of SP- and CGRP-IR cell bodies within DRG explants. Capsaicin in 100 microM concentration produced complete elimination of SP-IR fibers and a greater decrease in the number of CGRP-IR fibers, but failed to completely eliminate IR cell bodies. Exposure of the cultures to the irritants in the same concentrations for 90 min did not produce a measurable effect on SP- or CGRP-IR in neurites or cell bodies. Furthermore, our results show that SP-IR neuronal elements are more sensitive to capsaicin than CGRP-IR elements.", "Since tissue homeostasis depends on a precise balance among cell proliferation, senescence, and cell death, we explored the effects of IR (2-20 Gy) on the proliferative activity of DPSCs and the molecular pathways involved. DPSCs responded to IR (20 Gy) with senescence detected as SA-\u03b2-galactosidase positivity, beginning on the third day after irradiation. We conclude that DPSCs respond to IR-induced damage by permanent cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase and by stress-induced premature senescence.", "Exposure to IR occurs in the presence of multiple stressors whose possible cooperative effects on IR-induced damage have thus far received scant attention. In fact, it has been suggested that As may modulate IR-induced damage . However, characteristic to IR is its ability to induce damage that can manifest itself many generations after the initial insult. The lesion responsible for the initiation and perpetuation of IR-induced genomic instability is unknown: it has been hypothesized that elevated and persistent levels of cellular stress may be one underlying mechanism. Hence, a possible scenario is that cells, following simultaneous or sequential exposure to EMFs or as a result of being chronically exposed to chemical contaminants, may incur a sustained level of stress whereby IR-induced lesion(s) are enhanced. In order to achieve realistic conclusions on IR-related health risks, it is therefore important to design experiments that include spatially coincident exposure conditions and that examine the temporal scale of effects to ascertain the possible cooperation between environmental trace contaminants and EMFs on IR-induced damage. examined the effects of magnetic resonance on mouse C3H 10T1/2 cells failing to demonstrate an IR-like effectiveness for various endpoints, which included cell killing, transformation and chromosome aberrations. Several studies have investigated whether ELF magnetic fields are able to enhance IR-induced cyto- and genotoxicity. The incidence of micronuclei (MN) was measured to investigate whether 50-Hz EMF would potentiate IR-induced genomic alterations in normal cells from rat tracheal epithelium, an system which lends itself to the identification of tumor-promoting early stages . No detectable changes in cell cycling patterns or altered expression of G1 regulatory proteins Cdk4 and cyclin D1 were found with regard to IR exposure alone. Similar results reporting no discernable cell cycle modulation by ELF magnetic fields were obtained following low doses of IR in breast cancer cells or in rodent repair-proficient cells . reported a potentiating effect in two separate studies , using ELF magnetic fields of varying intensity: an increase in IR-induced HPRT mutation rate and in DNA breaks were found in a rodent cell line and in human glioma cells , respectively. In the latter study, acute exposure to 50\u2013400mT magnetic fields, combined with a single high dose of X-rays, led to enhanced DNA break yield as compared to IR exposure alone, in agreement with previous findings showing an enhancement of X-ray-induced mutations . Since no elevation in the incidence of IR-induced damage was found for low-intensity magnetic fields (5mT) under conditions non-permissive for DNA break rejoining , the increase in X-ray-induced mutation could be due to ELF fields affecting efficient DNA repair during prolonged post-IR exposures . However, the authors did not observe any effect on IR-induced lethality by strong magnetic fields under physiological temperature exposure conditions nor did the vast majority of these studies show the ability by ELF fields alone of damaging DNA. , in whose hands 1mT 50-Hz fields were not only able to increase the rate of mutations induced by IR, even at very low doses, but also to induce lesions . Very few studies have actually looked at combined exposure to IR and RF. The genotoxicity of these types of radiation has been mainly studied separately by considering occupationally exposed groups that either accumulated doses of IR or absorbed RF: Lalic et al. In both groups, a significant positive correlation was found between aberration yield and cumulative 6-year IR dose. To explore the possibility that RF may act as a tumor promoter for IR-initiated tumorigenesis, Heikkinen et al. total-body irradiated with 4Gy in 3 equal fractions two groups of mice, which were then chronically exposed (78 weeks) to either continuous frequency-modulated RF, with nominal average SAR 1.5W/kg, or to amplitude-modulated GSM RF with SAR 0.35W/kg, both at 902.5MHz: neither type of RF signal was able to modify the induction by IR of malignant lymphomas as assessed by haematological and histopathological examinations. A complex study was carried out to investigate leukemia and lymphoma risk factors in Germany, in which all data concerning disease incidence, presence of transmission lines and time of usage of mobile phones or Wi-Fi devices and occupational exposure to IR due to vicinity of nuclear plants were collected for 12 years . Very recently, the possible health-related aspects of combined exposure to IR and RF have been examined highlighting the need for current safety standards to take into account possible synergistic effects of these radiation fields at the levels that occur in the imaging technology based on PET/MR devices . Thus, as can be inferred from a very recent review by Verschaeve with regard to cytogenetic biomonitoring studies of individuals exposed to RF either occupationally or as a result of frequent usage of RF-emitting devices, large inter-disciplinary investigations are needed and designed to include lifetime and workplace combined exposure to environmental, therapeutic or diagnostic IR and RF. Although the most poignant observations are arguably expected to derive from epidemiology-like studies, it is research that has produced the little existing data on the effects of spatially and temporally related combined exposure to IR. However, no firm conclusion can be inferred on a synergistic/additive action by RF on IR-induced lesions. Unlike the above mentioned studies, we used a much higher IR dose (4Gy) and Fluorescence Hybridization (FISH)-based analysis of chromosome aberrations. It is well known that repair of UV-induced damage occurs mainly by the nucleotide excision (NER) pathway in mammalian cells whereas the most radiobiologically significant IR-induced lesions, i.e. Therefore, using EMFs in combination with radiations that cause lesions acted upon by different repair systems, can unveil possible co-genotoxic effects of EMFs as consequence of a differential impact on IR mutagenicity mediated by repair pathways. Inclusion of high-LET IR and RF fields is necessary to better mimic daily combined exposure scenarios. In terms of its modes of action on biological systems, IR represents the best-characterized physical genotoxic and carcinogenic agent to which we all are exposed. Concomitant exposure to prolonged, low levels of chemical genotoxins may have a multiplicative or synergistic effect on the contribution of environmental and occupational IR exposures to life-long DNA damage . Even though the relevance of combined exposures to IR and environmental toxicants in radiation protection has been widely recognized by UNSCEAR , which identified a number of chemical agents that interact with radiation, such as 4-NQO and the already cited heavy metal of environmental importance, arsenic (As), there are only limited data on the effects of low levels of naturally occurring chemicals on low-LET IR damage. Furthermore, essentially no quantitative data exist on the impact that chronic exposure to such chemicals can have on IR of higher LET, hence of greater relative biological effectiveness. That chemical agent exposure may affect subsequent cellular challenge to IR is conceivable. Deregulated genes involved in DNA DSB repair may be mechanistically encompassed by chemically induced modification of IR-specific damage. In order to accumulate quantitative data on the possible health consequences from daily low-level exposure situations to IR and chemicals, a study was conducted on the effects of gamma radiation with two As compounds, sodium arsenite and arsenic trioxide, and cadmium in human lymphoblastoid cells . It showed that at non-toxic, close to naturally occurring concentrations arsenic trioxide but not sodium arsenite synergistically enhanced IR-induced apoptosis, while higher concentrations of both arsenicals significantly increased the occurrence of micronucleated cells following high dose of IR. The authors concluded that the two As compounds may interfere with IR-induced damage as regards their ability to produce DNA\u2013protein crosslinks, affect DNA repair and favour apoptosis suppression. Indeed, the ability of As to modify cell response to IR-induced damage by its putative interference with cellular repair systems had been reported earlier by Jha et al. in human lymphocytes: they showed that sodium arsenite perturbed cell-cycle progression of phytohaemmaglutinin-activated cells and increased chromatid- and chromosome-type damage induced by IR. Cadmium, on the other hand, resulted in a reduction of IR-induced apoptosis and in an increase in DNA damage at low concentrations and at all doses of IR used . Since for all the chemicals tested co-genotoxic effects were observed that suggested inhibition of IR damage repair enzymes or disturbance of their efficiency by giving rise to DNA\u2013protein linkages, it was concluded that these compounds may enhance carcinogenicity by IR as well as other mutagens. The hypothesis that cadmium exposure may modulate the efficiency of repair of IR-induced DNA damage leading to an increase in potentially lethal damage, hence an increase in cell radiosensitivity, was successfully demonstrated by Grygoryev et al. in medaka fish fibroblasts showing that cadmium increased IR-associated cell death and expression of damage markers such as DNA DSB and 8-hydroxyguanine base modifications. Moreover, evidence for a synergistic modulation of IR-induced bystander effects has been reported for two common water contaminants (cadmium and aluminium) in salmon . To our knowledge, no study has thus far taken into account the aggregate exposure to IR, chronically present contaminants and EMFs such as the microwave fields associated with mobile telephony and Wi-Fi technology. In this aspect, these patterns are strikingly similar to those known for the non-targeted effects of low doses of IR. The mechanisms of IR-induced genomic instability, which manifests itself in the form of delayed genomic damage no longer reconcilable quantitatively with the initially inflicted damage, are unknown. Genomic instability has been historically associated with IR exposure at low doses and is strongly influenced by radiation quality . More recently, a synergistic effect was found between the heavy metal Cr(VI) and IR for the induction of genomic instability in human fibroblasts . Hence, RF may epigenetically modulate genomic instability inducible by chronical chemical exposure and/or IR of various quality. For all these reasons, new investigations are needed to explore the effects of multiple stressors on damage by IR of varying quality that incorporate both chemical and RF exposure. The usual experience regarding exposure to IR is in spatio-temporal combination with a complex mixture of such agents. In addition to known mutagens, presumptive DNA-damaging agents, such as EMFs fields, ought to be also considered since they may influence cellular responses to IR or chemicals, for instance by sublethal stress generation.", "This enhanced resistance to IR in DAB2IP-deficient prostate cancer cells is primarily due to faster DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair kinetics. Finally, shDAB2IP cells showed resistance to IR-induced apoptosis that could result from a striking decrease in the expression levels of proapoptotic proteins caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9, and significantly higher levels of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and STAT3 than those in shVector cells. In summary, DAB2IP plays a significant role in prostate cell survival following IR exposure due to enhanced DSB repair, robust G(2)-M checkpoint control, and resistance to IR-induced apoptosis.", "Until now, the association between SATT and IR has not been evaluated in obese prepubertal children. We aimed to determine the relation of SATT with clinical anthropometric and metabolic parameters and to provide cutoff value of SATT associated with IR in obese prepubertal children. SATT (6.54 \u00b1 1.38 mm) and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (3.2 \u00b1 2) values of obese prepubertal subjects were significantly higher than those of the lean subjects (3.72 \u00b1 0.57 mm and 1.6 \u00b1 1) in the control group (both p < 0.001). Bivariate correlation analysis showed significant correlation between SATT, age, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), mid-arm circumference (MAC), triceps skin fold (TSF) thickness, insulin, and HOMA-IR (r = 0.547, r = 0.524, r = 0.543, r = 0.431, r = 0.289, r = 0.402, r = 0.400, r = 0.328, r = 0.289, p < 0.05, respectively). As an optimal cutoff point, an SATT of 4.33 mm determined IR with 93.3% sensitivity and 51% specificity. Our study on obese prepubertal children showed that SATT was significantly correlated with age, BMI, WC, HC, MAC, TSF, insulin, and HOMA-IR.", "Here, we demonstrate that this activity of IR in lung cancer cells is mediated by a signaling pathway involving p38 kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Akt, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2). The invasion-promoting doses of IR also increased and reduced the levels of vimentin and E-cadherin, respectively, both of which are markers for the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Interestingly, all of these malignant actions of IR were mimicked by the overexpression of Bcl-X(L), a pro-survival member of the Bcl-2 family, in lung cancer cells. Moreover, both RNA and protein levels of Bcl-X(L) were elevated upon irradiation of the cells, and the prevention of this event using small-interfering RNAs of Bcl-X(L) reduced the ability of IR to promote invasion signals and EMT-associated events. This suggests that Bcl-X(L) functions as a signaling mediator of the malignant effects of IR. It was also demonstrated that IR enhances signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation, and the reduction of STAT3 levels via RNA interference prevented IR-induced Bcl-X(L) accumulation, and thus all the tested Bcl-X(L)-dependent events. Overall, the data suggest that IR induces Bcl-X(L) accumulation via STAT3, which then promotes cancer cell invasion and EMT-associated markers. Our findings demonstrate a novel function of Bcl-X(L) in cancer, and also advance our understanding of the malignant actions of IR significantly.", "Exposure to IR has been shown to induce the formation of senescence markers, a phenotype that coincides with life-long delayed repair and regeneration of irradiated tissues. We hypothesised that IR-induced senescence markers could persist long-term in vivo, possibly contributing to the permanent reduction in tissue functionality. We show that mice exposed to IR have persistent DNA damage and an increased expression of p16 The extent to which exposure to IR can induce the long-term accumulation of putative senescence markers such as DNA damage foci formation is unknown. These results are in agreement with previous work showing similar or slightly higher background DNA damage levels \u2013 differences we believe can be attributed to the methodology used and/or housing conditions of mice ( To determine the relevance of our findings in mice for humans, we obtained skin biopsies from age-matched patients (10\u00b16 versus 13\u00b17 years of age) that had been exposed or not to IR (12 Gy). The group exposed to IR was biopsied over a 2\u201352 weeks interval following irradiation (median 8 weeks). On average, this group had a significantly higher proportion (15 vs 5%, p<0.001) of cells containing DNA damage foci in the dermis ( As expected, we also observed almost complete co-localization between 53BP1 and \u03b3-H2AX foci after IR exposure ( To better understand the relationship between the IR and time-dependent persistence of DNA damaged cells, we assayed tissues from control and irradiated mice for the expression of p16 Despite that damaged cells undoubtedly accumulate in tissues long-term post irradiation, our result showed that a significant proportion of these cells are cleared/replaced over time. We then determined whether the proportion of double positive cells (BrdU The accumulation of DNA damaged cells and other senescence markers with age coincide with reduced immune function ( To answer this question, we used Rag2 Leukocytes counts are greatly reduced soon after exposure to IR, and remain low for a few weeks. We therefore considered the possibility that cells with permanent DNA damage and/or p16 We also assessed the role T, B and NK cells in eliminating damaged cells and p16 Because of the pivotal role p53 plays in orchestrating DNA damage responses and cell fate, we asked whether p53 inactivation could prevent (by interfering with DNA damage response signalling) or increase (by limiting DNA repair and apoptosis) the long-term accumulation of IR-induced senescence markers. Answering this question is important because inhibitors of apoptosis, many targeting the p53 pathway, are currently being tested for their ability to prevent side-effects of cancer therapies ( Here, we provide the first evidence that exposure to IR, independent of the immune status and p53 function, induces the long-term accumulation of DNA damaged cells. The persistence of these damaged cells is unlikely to reflect poor DNA repair as cells were able to repair most of the damage formed by IR (>10 foci per nuclei on average), leaving only one or two foci remaining. Several factors can lead to persistent DNA damage, including telomere attrition/dysfunction (d\u2019Adda The proportion of BrdU Experiments using immune deficient Rag2 Unexpectedly, and in contrast with the previously known role of p53 in inducing apoptosis shortly after irradiation ( We also found that IR-induced p16 Finally, permanent growth arrest in the form of cellular senescence is a recognized tumour suppressive response ( 8\u201312 week old female C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Saint-Constant, QC). Paraffin embedded human skin biopsies obtained from patients previously exposed or not to IR, and from which we obtained informed consent, were deparaffinised with xylene and antigens retrieved by steaming slides in sodium citrate buffer (pH.6.0) using an Oster food steamer (model 5715) for 45 minutes. Statisticaldifferences were assessed using unpaired Student\u2019s RNA was isolated from homogenized liver, brain and lung tissues collected from control (ctrl) and from irradiated (8 Gy TBI) C57BL/6 mice sacrificed at the indicated time in weeks (W) post IR.", "Due to skewed distribution, log-transformed values of plasma triglycerides, insulin, white blood cell counts and HOMA-IR were used in the analysis. To investigate the possible relation between anthropometric, metabolic and hematological characteristics, data were divided by quartiles of HOMA-IR. Equality of means of each variable across quartiles of HOMA-IR degree was tested by analysis of variance (ANOVA). A \u03c7 test was performed to check independence between smoking status and HOMA-IR quartile groups. Multiple linear regression analysis was carried out using HOMA-IR as a dependent variable to identify relationship with age, body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), serum iron, triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, WBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Women had higher BMI, fasting insulin, glucose, lipid profiles, serum TIBC and HOMA-IR compared with men. In male non-smokers, hemoglobin was correlated with HOMA-IR (=0.20, =0.0186) and with fasting insulin (=0.19, =0.0255), which are often used as surrogates for insulin resistance in those without diabetes as well as BMI, WHR, total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, post-load 2 h blood glucose, serum iron and serum iron/TIBC ratio. In female non-smokers, HOMA-IR was correlated with hemoglobin (=0.10, =0.0017) and with WBC count (=0.15, =0.0001). However, HOMA-IR and fasting insulin were not associated with plasma hemoglobin levels or WBC counts in either male or female smokers. In addition, HOMA-IR was not associated with the number of platelets or serum iron levels in either male or female non-smokers. By dividing subjects into quartiles of HOMA-IR, it was shown that men in the upper quartile had a higher BMI, plasma triglyceride concentrations and hemoglobin levels than those in the lower quartile ( ). In women, higher BMI, total cholesterol, triglyceride, WBC counts, hemoglobin levels, serum TIBC and lower HDL cholesterol concentrations were found in the subjects in the upper quartile for HOMA-IR. Neither men nor women showed differences in serum iron, iron/TIBC concentrations or current smoking ratios among the different HOMA-IR groups. In a multiple linear regression analysis with HOMA-IR as a dependent variable, only BMI, WHR, hemoglobin, hematocrit and serum TIBC were predictive variables of HOMA-IR in men ( =0.24). In our study, stratifying major variables of the metabolic syndrome for the degree of IR, subjects with a higher degree of IR showed a higher WBC count and hemoglobin concentrations than subjects with a lower degree of IR.", "Both IGF-I and IGF-II interact with the IGF-IR, a trans-membrane tyrosine kinase that is structurally and functionally related to the IR. IGF-II can also bind to the IGF-IIR with high affinity. Cloning of the IGF-IIR cDNA revealed that it is identical to the previously characterized cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptor, which plays a role in endocytosis and intracellular trafficking of M6P-tagged proteins. Most, if not all, of the effects of IGF-I result from its activation of the IGF-IR. IGF-I does not cross-react with the IR, except at pharmacological doses, since IGF-I has a relative affinity almost two orders of magnitude higher for the IGF-IR, as compared to the IR. Until recently, it was thought that IGF-II, like IGF-I, bound at significant levels to the IGF-IR, but not the IR. Studies of knockout mice lacking various components of the IGF and insulin receptor systems suggested that IGF-II acted through the IR during the early stages of development, before IGF-IR gene expression was detectable . The molecular basis for this phenomenon was revealed when it was discovered that a splice variant of the IR displayed high affinity for IGF-II. The IR transcript is subject to alternative splicing of exon 11, which encodes a 12-amino acid segment in the C-terminus of the extracellular subunit. Previous studies had shown that the IR isoform encoded by the mRNA lacking the exon 11 sequence (IR-A) displayed a 2-fold higher affinity for insulin than the IR-B isoform, which includes exon 11. More recently, it has been reported that the IR-A isoform functions as a high-affinity receptor for IGF-II and mediates predominantly proliferative effects, as compared to the principally metabolic effects elicited by insulin stimulation of the IR-B isoform . Thus, IGF-I functions primarily by activating the IGF-IR, whereas IGF-II can act through either the IGF-IR or through the IR-A isoform. The complexity of IGF signaling is increased by the formation of hybrid receptors that result from the dimerization of IGF-IR and IR hemireceptors. Each hybrid receptor consists of a single \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunit linked by disulfide bonds, which are formed in the Golgi apparatus of cells expressing both the IGF-IR and the IR. This could be due to the preferential formation of disulfide bonds between cysteine residues in IGF-IR and IR subunits themselves. IGF-IR/IR hybrid receptors retain high affinity for IGF-I, but exhibit a dramatically decreased affinity for insulin. This is thought to reflect the ability of IGF-I to efficiently bind to either IGF-IR \u03b1 subunit, whereas tight insulin binding requires interaction with both of the \u03b2 subunits found in the IR. Indeed, this has been proposed as a mechanism by which up-regulation of IGF-IR expression could cause insulin resistance in cells that express the IR. The effects of hybrid receptors are further complicated by the presence of the IR-A and IR-B isoforms and their different IGF-II-binding characteristics. It is likely that hybrids form between both IR-A/IGF-IR and IR-B/IGF-IR form, since most cell express both splice variants. It has been recently demonstrated that IGF-IR/IR-A hybrids bind IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin, whereas IGF-IR/IR-B hybrids bind IGF-I with high affinity, IGF-II with low affinity, and do not bind insulin . Therefore, the relative expression of the IGF-IR and IR genes and the degree of alternative splicing of exon 11 of the IR gene governs the ability of a given cell to respond to IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin. The various signaling pathways regulated by the IGFs are largely represented by those identified to date for the IGF-IR (). When IGF-I or IGF-II binds to the extracellular subunit of the IGF-IR, a conformational change is induced in the trans-membrane \u03b2 subunits, resulting in trans-autophosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain of the \u03b2 subunit. These phosphorylated residues, particularly tyrosine 950 in the juxtamembrane domain, can then function as docking sites for the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) and Shc adaptor proteins. Tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins by the receptor tyrosine kinase allows IRS and Shc proteins to recruit other factors, such as Grb2/SOS and the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidyl inositol 3\u2032-kinase (PI3 kinase), thereby leading to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) and PI3 kinase cascades, which are the major signal transduction cascades triggered by the activated IGF-IR. The IRS proteins are early substrates of the IGF-IR and IR, and function as docking proteins that link these receptors to various downstream signaling pathways. The four members of the IRS family of proteins, IRS-1 through 4, share a high degree of similarity, yet each has a unique structure . The presence of different combinations of IRS proteins may result in different cellular responses to activation of the IGF-IR. In fact, recent studies have suggested that IRS-3 and IRS-4 can actually processes that are mediated through IRS-1 and IRS-2. The relative levels of Shc and IRS proteins may also be important for influencing IGF action, in that Shc and IRS proteins have been shown to compete for binding to tyrosine 950 of the activated IGF-IR. In addition, the expression levels of the IGF-IR and IR are predictive of breast cancer outcome. Experimentally, modulation of IGF-IR activity affects the growth of many types of tumor cells. Regulation of IGF-IR gene expression is closely associated with the function of a variety of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. Expression of wild-type p53 inhibits IGF-IR gene expression, whereas mutant p53 upregulates IGF-IR gene expression . Mdm-2 targets p53 for degradation; an Mdm-2-mediated reduction in p53 could thereby induce upregulation of the IGF-IR and increase the survival of cancer cells . Expression of the IGF-IR is also regulated by the Src tyrosine kinase, the PKB/Akt serine-threonine kinase, and the PTEN protein phosphatase. Constitutively active Akt or Src-activated Akt upregulates IGF-IR gene expression, whereas PTEN counteracts this effect in pancreatic cancer cells and renders the cells more invasive . Migration of epithelial colonic cells is dependent on IGF-IR-induced alterations in integrins and cell adhesion complexes. While IGF-IR activation did not alter integrin expression levels, most of the integrins re-localized to the leading edge of migrating cells in response to IGF-I stimulation. Furthermore, activation of the IGF-IR disrupts the E-cadherin/catenin complex and its association with the cytoskeleton . Similarly, in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, the IGF-IR was shown to directly interact with the cell adhesion complex comprised of E-cadherin, \u03b2-catenin, and p120 catenin. When IGF-IR antisense mRNA was expressed in MCF-7 cells, the cells exhibited a more malignant phenotype that was associated with a reduction in the cell\u2013cell adhesion complex. Such cross-talk may occur between receptors within the same family, such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and IGF-I receptors, which are both tyrosine kinase receptors or between different families such as nuclear steroid receptors and the IGF-IR or G protein-coupled receptors and the IGF-IR . GBM(R) cells exhibited compensatory up-regulation of IGF-IR levels in response to AG1478 treatment. In another example, the IGF-IR also protects mammary epithelial cells from apoptosis. Activation of the IGF-IR induces serine phosphorylation of BAD in this cell type, but this is mediated via transactivation of the EGF receptor, as this effect was blocked by ZD1839, a specific EGFR tyrosine kinase antagonist . Activation of the IGF-IR and subsequent activation of the PI3 kinase and MAP kinase pathways induces extension of lamellipodia in neuroblastoma cell lines . Various strategies have been used to block the IGF-IR in order to prevent tumor cell growth and to increase apoptosis of malignant cells. Expression of a dominant-negative truncated IGF-IR in colon cancer cells reduced the level of vascular endothelial growth factor expression, impaired tumor progression in nude mice, and increased tumor cell apoptosis . overexpressed a dominant-negative form of the IGF-IR with a mutated ATP-binding site in Ewing's sarcoma cells. Other techniques that have been used to inactivate the IGF-IR include expression of truncated soluble receptors to prevent ligand-receptor interactions and expression of peptides that could interfere with these interactions . Perhaps the most exciting potential therapeutic modalities will arise from the recent crystallographic studies of the tyrosine kinase domain of the IGF-IR and the production of small molecules that can act as specific antagonists for the IGF-IR and inhibit its anti-apoptotic effects . Numerous studies performed over the last 20 years have suggested that transformed cells express the IGF-IR at higher levels than normal cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which IGF-IR gene expression is increased in tumors remain largely unidentified. Amplification of the IGF-IR locus at band 15q26 has been reported in a small number of breast cancer and melanoma cases . During tumorigenesis, overexpression of the IGF-IR is presumed to increase the cellular responsiveness to the IGFs, in terms of proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. However, the role of the IGF-IR in the progression of epithelial tumors that are most prevalent in adults is likely to be more complex . It has been suggested that the IGF-IR itself can function as an oncogene, based upon the phenotype of fibroblasts overexpressing the IGF-IR . Other studies have used IGF-IR overexpression in fibroblasts to show that the IGF-IR can modulate radiosensitivity . Nevertheless, it should be noted that a recent report demonstrated that inhibition of IGF-IR activity by a selective kinase inhibitor in MCF-7 breast cancer cells increases radiosensitivity . The many studies describing over-expression of the IGF-IR in breast, prostate, and other tumor types have been largely based on analyses of tissue homogenates or established cancer cell lines. The apparent IGF-IR content of tissue homogenates, in particular, can be affected by contamination with stroma, which would dilute the IGF-IR content in normal epithelium or small tumors. More focused studies of IGF-IR expression in breast and prostate that employed immunohistochemistry or matched cell lines corresponding to normal and tumor tissue revealed that normal epithelium and early-stage tumors both express abundant levels of the IGF-IR, and that IGF-IR expression is significantly reduced in advanced, metastatic cancer . challenged this view, reporting that IGF-IR expression was decreased in certain metastatic prostate cancer samples, as compared to benign or carcinoma tissue, but that IGF-IR expression was increased in the majority of samples studied (eight out of 12). However, it should be noted that IGF-IR immunostaining with a single \u03b2-subunit antibody was diffusely cytoplasmic in most samples, in contrast to the expected membrane localization reported by Chott et al. Thus, the levels of IGF-IR expression in the progression of prostate cancer have not been clearly established. Activation of the IGF-IR present in normal epithelium in response to elevated levels of circulating IGF-I may underlie the epidemiological data described above. In contrast, the subsequent decrease in IGF-IR (if this is substantiated by additional studies) may represent an attempt by established cancer cells to counteract the potential differentiating effects of IGF-I at sites of metastasis. Alternatively, decreased expression of the IGF-IR may protect tumor cells from a novel, non-apoptotic form of programmed cell death that has been recently described as being triggered by the unliganded IGF-IR . It is clear, however, that the prevailing notion that the IGF-IR is routinely over-expressed in transformed cells is somewhat of an over-generalization.", "This regulatory mechanism parallels the established link between IR and p85 via insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. A direct association was demonstrated between Grb10 and p85 but was not observed between Grb10 and IRS proteins. In addition, no effect of mouse Grb10 was observed on the association between IRS-1 and p85, on IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity, or on insulin-mediated activation of IR or IRS proteins. The dissection of the interaction of mouse Grb10 with p85 and the resulting regulation of PI 3-kinase activity should help elucidate the complexity of the IR signaling mechanism.", "The major early steps of the insulin signalling pathway involve tyrosine phosphorylation of IR substrates 1 and 2 (IRS-1 and IRS-2) . Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins transduces signalling pathways that regulate essential cellular processes including intermediary metabolism, gene expression, growth and differentiation of pancreatic islets . Recent studies have shown that activation of the IR in \u03b2-cells mediates not only insulin secretion but also insulin gene transcription . In insulin-resistant tissues or cells, deficiencies have been shown in several steps of the signalling, including autophosphorylation of the IR in response to insulin binding . The phosphorylation status and expression of IR and IRS-1 in freshly isolated rat pancreatic islets incubated with palmitate were determined. Antibodies against phosphotyrosine, IR, and IRS-1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The nitrocellulose membranes were incubated for 4 h at 22\u00b0C with antibodies against phosphotyrosine, IR, and IRS-1 diluted in blocking buffer with 3% non-fat dry milk, and then washed for 60 min in blocking buffer without milk. For reprobing, membranes were stripped, washed, and incubated with either anti-IR polyclonal antibody or anti-IRS-1 polyclonal antibody. An increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and pp185 (IRS-1/-2) even at low palmitate concentrations such as 1 \u03bcM was detected. The same membranes were reprobed with anti-IR and anti-IRS-1. We detected an augmentation in IR protein level to 148\u00b112% (<0.05) in palmitate-treated islets ( ). The same approach was used to identify IRS-1 protein level. Similar to IR, the IRS-1 protein level increased to 194\u00b126% (<0.05) in the palmitate group (). In order to investigate if the palmitate-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and increased protein levels of IR and IRS-1 were due to palmitate oxidation, the islets were incubated with 2-bromopalmitate, an inhibitor of CPT-1. The exposure of the islets to palmitate plus 2-bromopalmitate resulted in a similar increase of tyrosine phosphorylation status in IR (by 40\u00b114%, <0.05) and in pp185 (by 82\u00b134%, <0.05) to that observed when palmitate was added alone. The incubation of pancreatic islets with 2-bromopalmitate alone did not change the phosphorylation status of IR and pp185 when compared with the control (without fatty acid) ( ). Total islet extracts were also analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-IR and anti-IRS-1 antibodies (). Similar to what was observed for tyrosine phosphorylation, the protein levels of IR and IRS-1 remained unchanged in the pancreatic islets incubated with 2-bromopalmitate alone when compared to control. To determine if protein acylation could be involved in the palmitate-induced IR and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and increased protein levels, the effect of cerulenin, an acylation inhibitor, was tested. Preincubation with cerulenin at 30 \u03bcg/ml for 30 min abolished the IR and pp185 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by 100 \u03bcM palmitate to 48\u00b15% (<0.05; ) and to 78\u00b15% (<0.05; ) respectively. The increased protein levels of IR and IRS-1 induced by palmitate were also abolished by preincubation of pancreatic islets with cerulenin (). Incubation with cerulenin alone had no effect either on tyrosine phosphorylation or on protein levels of IR and IRS-1 when compared to control (data not shown). Short-term incubation with palmitate in medium containing 5.6 mM glucose induced an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation status and in protein levels of IR and IRS-1 in isolated rat pancreatic islets. These effects may have a biological significance, since IR autophosphorylation has been correlated with insulin secretion . An effect of fatty acids on signalling molecules such as IR, IRS-1 and protein kinase C has been proposed in skeletal muscle cells but little is known about this molecular mechanism in pancreatic islets . Exposure of these cells to palmitate for 30 min showed up-regulation of some insulin-induced activities including tyrosine phosphorylation of IR. The increased IR phosphorylation in isolated pancreatic islets at 5.6 mM glucose by palmitate may play a role in the cellular mechanism by which this fatty acid modulates glucose-induced insulin secretion. Using the CPT-1 inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate, we could detect that palmitate-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and increased protein levels of IR and IRS-1 were not a result of fatty acid oxidation. Cerulenin abolished the palmitate effect on protein levels and phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1.", "Both PML and TopBP1 colocalized with the IR-induced bromodeoxyuridine single-stranded DNA foci. IR and interferon (IFN) coinduce the expression levels of both TopBP1 and PML. In PML-deficient NB4 cells, TopBP1 was unable to form IR-induced foci. All-trans-retinoic acid induced reorganization of the PML nuclear body (NB) and reappearance of the IR-induced TopBP1 foci. Furthermore, PML-deficient cells express a low level of TopBP1, and its expression cannot be induced by IR or IFN. Pulse-chase labeling analysis demonstrated that PML overexpression stabilized the TopBP1 protein, suggesting that PML plays a role in regulating the stability of TopBP1 in response to IR. Together, our findings demonstrate that PML regulates TopBP1 functions by association and stabilization of the protein in response to IR-induced DNA damage.", "The IR is a receptor tyrosine kinase, and the binding of insulin to its receptor results in autophosphorylation of the IR and tyrosyl phosphorylation of IR substrate proteins (). Much attention has been focused on protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), which inhibits insulin phosphorylation of the IR and insulin receptor substrates (). Interestingly, a recent paper showed that SREBP-1 was induced in livers from mice deficient for IRS-2 (). Since PTP1B-antisense mice show an increase in IRS-2 expression, this may account for the downregulation of SREBP-1 in the liver ().", "This study examines the association between global DNA methylation and IR using 84 monozygotic twin pairs. IR was estimated using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). The association between global DNA methylation and IR was examined using generalized estimating equation (GEE) and within\u2013twin pair analyses, adjusting for potential confounders. An index of IR, the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), was calculated as (fasting glucose [mmol/L]) \u00d7 (fasting insulin [\u03bcU/mL])/22.5 ( Global DNA methylation of Alu repetitive elements was quantified by a commercial service (EpigenDx, Inc., Worcester, MA). Statistical analyses were performed to examine whether global DNA methylation was associated with IR, accounting for known risk factors. Prior to analysis, IR and methylation data were logarithmically transformed. We first performed statistical analyses using generalized estimating equation (GEE) modeling to investigate the association between DNA methylation and IR. In the GEE model, IR was the dependent variable and methylation level at each CpG site or the mean methylation level was the independent variable, adjusting for age, current smoking (yes/no), BMI, HDL, LDL, and sBP. The intrapair difference in IR was similarly calculated. Then we performed linear regression by regressing the intrapair difference in IR (dependent variable) on the intrapair difference in mean Alu methylation level (independent variable), adjusting for intrapair differences in pack years, BMI, LDL, HDL, sBP, and depressive symptoms (assessed by Beck Depression Inventory\u2013II scores). To examine whether treatment of type 2 diabetes ( Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the twins Multivariate GEE analyses demonstrated that DNA methylation levels at all four CpG sites showed significant individual association with IR after adjustments for age, smoking, BMI, LDL, HDL, sBP, study affiliation (THS or SAVEIT), and depression. The mean methylation level of Alu elements was also significantly associated with IR ( A 10% increase in Alu methylation was associated with an increase in HOMA by GEE modeling DNA methylation levels of the two members within a pair were highly correlated at each of the four CpG sites (all Using a well-matched MZ twin sample, we demonstrated that global DNA methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes was significantly associated with IR, independent of established risk factors. Epigenetic factors have been suggested to play a critical role in the etiologies of metabolic disorders ( Although the molecular mechanism linking global DNA methylation and IR is unknown, a number of explanations are possible. First, because of practical difficulties in obtaining tissues from living individuals, methylation levels were tested in peripheral blood leukocytes but not directly from the primary affected organs in IR and diabetes (e.g., pancreata, skeletal muscles, or adipocytes). Therefore, our results may not provide a direct index of DNA methylation in the system of IR or insulin secretion. However, there is increasing evidence that leukocytes may be a useful cell model to evaluate epigenetic changes because epimutations may not be limited to the affected tissue but can also be detected in peripheral blood leukocytes ( Nonetheless, this is the first study to demonstrate the association of global DNA methylation in Alu elements with IR in a well-matched MZ twin sample. Previous studies show that interindividual epigenetic processes are under genetic control ( In summary, this study provides the first evidence that alteration in global DNA hypermethylation is associated with increased risk of IR independent of established risk factors. Because epigenetic modifications are possibly reversible, and IR usually precedes the onset of diabetes, our results, if confirmed, would suggest the potential for lifestyle or therapeutic interventions for IR and a wide range of metabolic disorders.", "", "Female Lesions in the brachiocephalic artery were significantly increased in male To further analyze the roles of different cell types in increased atherosclerosis observed in Next, to examine effects of impaired insulin signaling on macrophage content in atherosclerosis-prone vessels, serial sections of brachiocephalic arteries from To further investigate whether the expression level of IR and IRS-1 on macrophages and other bone-marrow-derived cells was important in the development of accelerated atherosclerosis in The initial study that characterized insulin signaling in To determine how reduced IR/IRS-1 levels affect insulin signaling and vascular functions, we first focused on the expression of antiatherogenic endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) We next focused on the MAP/ERK1/2 pathway that plays an important role in the inhibition of eNOS phosphorylation. To investigate the impact of impaired insulin signaling on aortic relaxation in To further assess endothelial status in aortas, we examined VCAM-1 expression within the brachiocephalic arteries from Having identified an important role of IR/IRS-1-dependent insulin signaling in the regulation of the AKT/eNOS and ERK pathways, we next sought to determine whether increased phosphorylation of ERK in To further define the phenotype of atherosclerotic plaques, we performed Sirius Red staining to examine maturation of collagen. Interactions of insulin with IRs activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI[3]K)/AKT signaling cascade and subsequently results in the induction of the active eNOS that plays an atheroprotective role. In conclusion, these results suggest that impaired IR/IRS-1 signaling provokes accelerated atherogenesis via increased vascular dysfunction. Hyperinsulinemia in insulin receptor/insulin receptor substrate-1 double heterozygous apolipoprotein E ( Increased atherosclerotic lesion size in insulin receptor/insulin receptor substrate-1 double heterozygous apolipoprotein E ( Role of impaired insulin receptor/insulin receptor substrate-1 (IR/IRS-1) signaling in macrophage functions.", "Twenty-four hours after seeding cells were treated with or without IR (8Gy). Five thousand cells were plated onto a 6-well plated and treated with IR 24h later. We examined the effects of IR on AMPK subunit expression in A549 cells ( ). Twenty-four hours following a single fraction of 8Gy IR we observed increased protein levels of each AMPK subunit and they were significantly higher at 48h (a). All AMPK subunits showed a statistically significant response to IR with increased mRNA levels except \u03b32. WT-MEFs responded rapidly to IR (8Gy) with increased phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC and a small increase in total AMPK levels, within 1h after IR, but this was effectively abolished in AMPK\u03b1-MEFs that lack AMPK\u03b1 (a). We showed earlier that IR activation of AMPK takes place downstream of ATM and recent reports suggest involvement of AMPK in mitosis and genomic stability . Although, IR alone enhanced acutely the levels of ATM, phosphorylated Chk2, and \u03b3H2AX in WT-MEFs, these events were inhibited in AMPK\u03b1-MEFs (a). The \u03b3H2AX immunoblotting results were verified with immunofluorescence microscopy, which also showed enhanced \u03b3H2AX foci in untreated AMPK\u03b1-MEFs, increased foci in WT-MEFs after IR but a reduced response in AMPK\u03b1-MEFs (c). Furthermore, IR (8Gy) increased significantly the phosphorylation levels of Akt (T308), p70 and 4-EBP1 in WT MEFs but, apart from Akt (T308), IR did not enhance significantly further the already enhanced activation of this pathway in AMPK\u03b1-MEFs (a). WT-MEFs exhibited an increase of their levels of p53 and p21 in response to 8Gy IR (b). However, AMPK\u03b1-MEFs failed to respond to IR and showed if anything a trend for reduced levels of p53 and p21 after IR (b). The results of three independent experiments were quantitated in c. We have previously implicated AMPK in the IR-induced G2-M checkpoint in lung cancer cells using AMPK knockdown with specific anti-AMPK\u03b11/2 subunit siRNAs . To verify these results in cells lacking AMPK, we analyzed cell cycle distribution in WT and AMPK\u03b1-MEFs before or 48h after IR of 8Gy ( a and b). WT-MEFs demonstrated a shift in cells from G1/S to G2/M in response to IR (G1/S: 82% and G2/M: 18% for untreated vs G1/S: 62% and G2/M: 38% for 8Gy treated cells) (a and b). Conversely, AMPK\u03b1-MEFs cells did not exhibit a detectable change in cell cycle distribution in response to IR (G1/S: 77% and G2/M: 23% for untreated, vs. G1/S: 78% and G2/M: 22% for 8Gy, a and b). a and b and b and c, indicating lack of induction of p53 and p21 in AMPK\u03b1-MEFs after IR. We compared the proliferation rates of WT and AMPK\u03b1-MEFs at their basal state and after IR (c). AMPK\u03b1-MEFs showed (i) a tendency to proliferate at a slightly increased rate compared to WT-MEFs (100% WT vs. 105% AMPK\u03b1) and (ii) a partial resistance to IR (2 and 8Gy), which, however, did not reach statistical significance in these experiments (15% increased over the control after 2Gy IR and 8% after 8Gy) (c). In this study we observed that 24\u201348h following a single dose of 8Gy, IR increased AMPK subunit protein levels in lung cancer cells (a). However, we have observed that IR increases AMPK subunit protein levels in breast cancer MCF7 cells also (), indicating that this phenomenon may be a universal response to IR. Furthermore, PCR analysis demonstrated an induction of AMPK mRNA expression within 24\u201348h following IR (b), suggesting that in cancer cells, AMPK gene expression is regulated not only at the translational but also at the transcriptional level. (2007) suggested that IR stimulates AMPK\u03b21/2 gene expression in HCT116 and H1299 cells in a p53-dependent manner. They related this effect of IR to the presence of putative p53 consensus binding sites on the AMPK\u03b21 and \u03b22 promoters. In our study induction of \u03b11/2 and \u03b31 gene expression by IR became more obvious 48h after IR delivery (). Furthermore, IR was shown to stimulate Sestrin2 expression . Early results from our laboratory suggest that IR increases significantly the sestrin2 protein levels in lung and breast cancer cell lines (). In ongoing studies we are investigating the role of sestrin2 in IR-induced AMPK expression and activity. IR stimulates expression of AMPK subunit genes and enhances their protein levels. AMPK appears to participate in signaling events that regulate basal ATM activity and response to IR. Loss of AMPK leads to deregulation of ATM activity, abnormal stimulation of the Akt-mTOR-p70/4-EBP1, and p53-p21 pathways, lack of normal response of these key enzymes to IR and loss of the IR-induced G2-M checkpoint.", "The aim of this study was to examine the effect of adrenomedullin (AM) on kidney injury induced by infrarenal abdominal aortic IR in rats. Thirty-two Wistar Albino rats were randomized into four groups (eight per group) as follows: Control group, IR group (120-minute ischemia and 120-minute reperfusion), IR + AM group (a bolus intravenously of 0.05 \u00b5g/kg/min AM), and control + AM group. IR significantly increased (p < 0.05 vs control group) and AM significantly decreased (p < 0.05 vs. IR group) all of the biochemical parameters. The results of this study indicate that AM attenuates both biochemically and immunohistopathologically kidney injury induced by aortic IR in rats.", "Binge-like ethanol drinking reduced NPY and Y1R IR in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), and 24 h of ethanol abstinence after a history of binge-like drinking promoted increases of Y1R and Y2R IR.", "A significant increase in the number of metastases was observed in MKR In MKR In order to examine the effects of hyperinsulinemia on the metastasis of tumor cells from the primary site, we examined levels of c-Myc, MMP-9, IR, IGF-IR and VEGF in tumor tissue extracted from control and MKR In order to find a potential mechanism to explain why Mvt1 cells grow faster and metastasize more readily in the presence of elevated insulin, we studied their reaction to insulin stimulation Mvt1 cells, like many other tumor types, over-express c-Myc, a transcription factor which is regulated by several extracellular growth factors [ To examine whether the increased metastatic burden in MKR At the end of the treatment period, all mice were sacrificed and numbers of macrometastases were quantified. Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing the IR become highly chemotactic toward insulin stimulation [ We observed more spontaneous metastases in the lungs of MKR Our analysis of tumor tissue reveals increased c-Myc expression in tumors of MKR c-Myc is integrally involved in breast cancer metastasis, promoting loss of apoptosis, invasion, and angiogenesis [ VEGF is a key mediator of angiogenesis and is essential for intravasation of metastasizing tumor cells [ We also demonstrated a significant up-regulation of the IR and an elevation of the IGF-IR in tumors from MKR Our finding of increased metastatic burden following intravenous injection of Mvt1 cells in the absence of a primary tumor suggests that hyperinsulinemia promotes increased survival or proliferation (or both) of circulating tumor cells that arrest in the lungs.

In vivo experimental data depicted a significant reduction of hepatic IR injury in All animal protocols were in accordance with the German guidelines for use of living animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the T\u00fcbingen University Hospital and the Regierungspr\u00e4sidium T\u00fcbingen. Student's In a model of murine hepatic IR injury we exposed previously characterized To gain further insight into the specific role of VASP we employed gene targeted repression using siRNA and injected animals 24 hours prior to the start of the experiment with siVASP or non-targeting siRNA (siSCR).", "Systemic IR is associated with impaired insulin signaling in the metabolic tissues and vasculature. In this review, we discuss the association between IR, metabolic stress, and atherosclerosis with focus on 1) tissue and cell distribution of insulin receptor and its differential signaling transduction and 2) potential mechanism of insulin signaling impairment and its role in the development of atherosclerosis and vascular function in metabolic disorders including hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperhomocysteinemia. Biological actions of insulin are initiated by its binding to its cell surface receptor, which results in autophosphorylation of the receptor and activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity ( Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS then binds to the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing adaptor protein p85, a regulatory subunit of PI3K, resulting in activation of the catalytic p110 subunit of PI3K ( In the parallel mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, an activated insulin receptor phosphorylates its intracellular substrate SH2 domain-containing alpha-2 collagen-related protein (Shc), which binds to growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), and results in activation of pre-associated guanosine triphosphate (GTP) exchange factor son of sevenless (Sos). Arrival of GLUT4 at the plasma membrane leads to cellular glucose influx ( Insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation requires PI3K-mediated signal involving upstream insulin receptor, IRS, downstream Akt, and protein kinase C (PKC) target enzymes, which induces phosphorylation of rab-GTPase-activating protein, AS160, leading to glucose uptake. Metabolic actions of insulin in liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle rely on tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins. Results from specific knockout models have shown that different IRS isoform appear to have specific roles in different tissues. IRS-1 proteins seem to be firmly associated with glucose homeostasis in skeletal muscle, adipose tissues, and pancreatic beta cells ( Normal metabolic processes in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue include stimulating glucose uptake and in liver inducing glycogen synthesis, reducing glucose production, and its release in to the blood. All of which are impaired in the IR condition ( In adipose tissue, insulin reduces the release of free fatty acid (FFA) by PI3K/Akt signaling, results in the HSL inhibition, which hydrolyzes triglycerides to release fatty acids ( Impaired insulin signaling in liver may contribute to elevated plasma FFA levels ( IR is a hallmark of metabolic disorders including obesity and T2DM. Multiple metabolic risk factors contribute to the development of IR including: hyperglycemia, increase FFA levels, and hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy). IR is an initiating pathogenic mechanism in T2DM. When beta cells of the pancreas fail to secrete enough insulin to overcome IR, overt hyperglycemia develops ( Hyperglycemia impairs both metabolic and vascular actions of insulin through multiple biochemical and cellular mechanisms. These IR derived mechanisms are multiply resourced by the following: 1) elevated oxidative stress, 2) increased flux through polyol and hexosamine biosynthetic pathways, 3) activation of diacylglycerol (DAG) and PKC, 4) formation of advance glycation end-products (AGE). All of these factors then contribute to endothelial dysfunction and accelerate atherosclerotic process ( Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by high glucose impaired, insulin stimulated activation of Akt and eNOS ( Hyperglycemia may impair metabolic and vascular actions of insulin by increased flux through the polyol and hexosamine biosynthetic pathway ( The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway serves as a nutrient sensor, which plays a role in IR and vascular complications by causing reversible O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modifications at regulatory serine/threonine phosphorylation sites on proteins involved in insulin signaling pathway. For example, increased O-GlcNacylation of IRS-1 may lead to reduced insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 and decreased glucose uptake ( Hyperglycemia and elevated FFA increase PKC activity by enhancing de novo synthesis of DAG from glucose ( One of the most harmful effects of hyperglycemia is the formation of AGE by the non-enzymatic reaction between glucose and proteins/lipids on the vessel wall ( Thus, hyperglycemia contributes to IR and endothelial dysfunction, by inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and over\u2013activating MAPK signaling pathway. Increase in plasma FFA levels contributes to IR, by inhibiting glucose transport and/or phosphorylation with a subsequent reduction in the rates of glucose oxidation and muscle glycogen synthesis ( IR has been implicated in promoting dyslipidemia, a well established risk factor of CVD. High circulating FFA levels enhances glucose output from the liver and reduces glucose disposal in skeletal muscle, thereby contributing to IR. The role of elevated circulating FFA has been emphasized as a major factor that connects IR and dyslipidemia ( Elevated cellular levels of lipid metabolites such as DAG, ceramide, and long-chain fatty acyl CoAs activate PKC and inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase beta subunit (IKKbeta) leading to serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 at amino acid position 307 (a negative regulation) and inhibit IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in the skeletal muscle ( An elevated plasma level of homocysteine (Hcy) is an independent risk factor for CVD ( It has been demonstrated that insulin resistant T2DM patients with CVD have elevated plasma Hcy levels ( Studies in cultured hepatoma cells indicated that Hcy thiolactone inhibit insulin signaling and it\u2019s action by increasing oxidative stress ( Briefly, atherosclerosis is initiated by endothelial injury and VSMC proliferation, and then injured EC will attract monocytes attending and adhering to endothelium. The MAPK-dependent signaling pathway controls proliferation and migration ( In general, insulin has anti-atherogenic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic effects, and these effects are reversed or blunted in the IR state. Endothelial dysfunction, an early event of atherosclerosis, has been documented in the IR states in animals and humans ( Furthermore, in a study using insulin receptor and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) deficient mice indicated that endothelial IR may accelerate atherosclerosis by causing impaired eNOS activation, increased endothelial VCAM expression, and increased leukocyte interaction with EC ( Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the contribution of impaired insulin signaling in VSMC to atherosclerosis. On the contrary, IR could also cause inflammation. Insulin signaling in macrophages leads to increase in viability, protein synthesis and secretion, and phagocytosis ( Insulin activates IRS/PI3K/Akt signaling in monocytes/macrophages, similar to that in the vascular cells and metabolic tissues except that IRS-1 isoform is undetectable in monocytes/macrophages ( Macrophage apoptosis in atherosclerotic lesions may add further to the monocyte recruitment, by the release of cytokines and may therefore, exacerbate the advancement of vascular lesion ( Lymphocytes and leukocytes are the cellular components of inflammation, which normally reside in blood and must extravasate the inflamed tissue to aid in inflammation. However, T lymphocytes have the atypical capability to express insulin receptors following presentation of an antigen in vivo and an antigen or mitogen in vitro ( Similar to monocytes, T lymphocytes adhere and infiltrate across the vascular endothelium into the subendothelial space, where they are immunologically active ( Remarkable evidences have demonstrated that atherosclerotic process is regulated by inflammatory mechanisms ( In atherosclerosis, macrophage activation/T lymphocytes infiltration secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic substances ( It has been demonstrated that FFA, inflammatory cytokines and the RAGE ( IR is commonly observed in the metabolic syndrome, in which multiple metabolic risk factors are co-existed including abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hyperhomocysteinemia. IR in metabolic tissues leads to metabolic disorders, in vascular cells it results in vessel compliance impairment, and in immune cells it causes inflammation initiation, which all contribute to the development of atherosclerosis ( Insulin signaling. Insulin binds to its receptor causes a conformational change, autophosphorylation of the receptor, and activation of two pathways; The PI3K/Akt pathway leads to IRS tyrosine phosphorylation, which further phosphorylate PI3K subunit p85 and heterodimerization of p85 and p110. Exercise or insulin sensitizer adiponectin activates AMPK, which causes serine phosphorylation of IRS (at amino acid position 789- a positive regulation), eNOS (a positive regulation), and rab-GTPase-activating protein-AS160 and threonine phosphorylation of TSC1/2 (a negative regulation); leading to PI3K/Akt activation, NO production, glucose uptake, and protein synthesis inhibition.

These leads to activation of IKKbeta and other stress sensitive Ser/Thr kinases, which cause serine phosphorylation of IRS (at amino acid position 307-a negative regulation) and PI3K/Akt inhibition (IR effect). AMPK counteract the stress induced IR by serine phosphorylation of eNOS (a positive regulation) and IRS (at amino acid position 789-a positive regulation), which improves vascular function and IR.

Skeletal muscle and systemic IR were measured in each group after 4 and 8 weeks. Catch-up growth-induced IR resulted in significant reductions in both average glucose infusion rate(60-120) at euglycemia and skeletal muscle glucose uptake.", "Rats were randomly divided into the following five groups: sham group, IR group and treatment group including ASG IV, ASG IV-TMPZ and nimodipine treatment. Micro-PET imaging showed that glucose metabolism in the right hippocampus was significantly decreased in the IR group compared to the sham group (P<0.01). IR induced the increase of Caspase-3 mRNA levels, MDA content and iNOS activity, but it caused the decrease of SOD activity and Bcl-2 expression compared the sham group (P<0.01). ASG IV-TMPZ and ASG IV reversed the IR-induced changes of these parameters, i.e.", "The MTT method was used to detect cell viability of CNE-2 cells at different time points after IR. Clonogenic survival assays were used to evaluate the radiosensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells treated with IR and IR combined with autophagy inhibitor (chloroquine phosphate), with autophagy inducer (rapamycin) or with PARP-1 inhibitor 3-amino benzamide (3AB). IR induced a massive accumulation of autophagosomes detected by TEM and intensified the conversion of cytosolic LC3-I to LC3-II. Compared with radiation alone, chloroquine phosphate (CDP) or 3AB combined with IR significantly decreased cell viability, as well as the autophagic ratio and LC3-II protein levels. To conclude, PARP-1 regulates IR-induced autophagy, and PARP-1 inhibitor contributes to the radiation sensitization of CNE-2 cells.", "The expression levels of TOB1 were significantly induced by IR radiation.", "Membranes were probed with the appropriate primary antibodies: anti-phospho IR-\u03b2 Statistical analyses were conducted using the Student\u2019s Transgenic MMTV-rtTA (MTB) and TetO- Others have shown that doxycycline-induced When administered doxycycline for several weeks, MTB/TAN mice developed multiple invasive mammary adenocarcinomas with tumors arising in all inguinal and thoracic glands ( MTB/TAN mice were reported to harbor To determine whether or not hyperinsulinemia enhances the progression of Epidemiological evidence suggests a causal relationship between type 2 diabetes and the incidence, recurrence and mortality from breast cancer.", "We investigated whether GGT among hepatic enzymes is independently associated with IR in obese Korean children. The homeostasis model for the calculation of an insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index was used where HOMA-IR = fasting glucose (mmol/L) \u00d7 fasting insulin ( The data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) or the absolute number (percentages). Among the metabolic variables, fasting glucose and insulin, HOMA-IR, and liver enzymes (GGT, ALT, AST) showed gender differences. And there was a gender difference in tanner stage: the girls had higher tanner stage than boys ( Tables Serum GGT and ALT, but not AST, were positively correlated with HOMA-IR in boys ( All liver enzymes were positively correlated with total cholesterol and triglycerides and negatively correlated with HDL-cholesterol in boys and girls, respectively. GGT was correlated with HOMA-IR and CRP more than ALT. In multiple regression analysis for HOMA-IR as dependent variable, GGT ( In overweight and obese Korean children, we found a significant association serum GGT activity with IR. GGT is a cell-surface protein contributing to the extracellular catabolism of glutathione (GSH) [ In our results, obesity and triglycerides were the major determinants of HOMA-IR in boys. These results are compatible with the result of Sinaiko et al., which showed heavy-insulin resistant adolescents had the highest triglycerides level [ Obesity and GGT were the major determinants of HOMA-IR in girls. The effect of triglycerides and GGT on IR was different by gender. originally reported that the degree of IR, as measured by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, explained a significant portion of the variance in the levels of triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol in obese adolescents [ The present study has some limitations. We used HOMA-IR as an index of insulin resistance, instead of euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. However, HOMA-IR is more practical and less invasive than the euglycemic clamp and used in many studies in children HOMA-IR as well as indices derived from the oral glucose tolerance test were well correlated with insulin sensitivity measured by the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. In summary, in overweight and obese Korean children at high risk for the development of type 2 diabetes, serum GGT activity showed a significant relationship with insulin resistance using HOMA-IR. *by Student's BMI: body mass index; BF%: body fat percent; CRP: C-reactive protein; HDL: high density lipoprotein; AST: aspartate transaminase; ALT: alanine transaminase; GGT: gamma-glutamyltransferase; HOMA-IR: homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. * BMI: body mass index; BF%: body fat percent; CRP: C-reactive protein; HDL: high density lipoprotein; AST: aspartate transaminase; ALT: alanine transaminase; GGT: gamma-glutamyltransferase; HOMA-IR: homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. * BMI: body mass index; BF%, body fat percent; CRP: C-reactive protein; HDL: high density lipoprotein; AST: aspartate transaminase; ALT: alanine transaminase; GGT: gamma-glutamyltransferase; HOMA-IR: homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance.

This review is centered on the long-term biological effects associated with IR exposure, mainly focusing on the epigenetic mechanisms (DNA methylation and small RNAs) involved in the molecular etiology of IR-induced genome instability, bystander and transgenerational effects. Here, we present evidence that IR-mediated effects are maintained by epigenetic mechanisms, and demonstrate how a novel, male germline-specific, small RNA pathway is posited to play a major role in the epigenetic inheritance of genome instability. Humans are of no exception, as we are exposed to IR via the air we breathe, the food we eat, and from the sky above us (cosmic rays), as well as the ground we walk on. However, it is becoming increasingly common for humans to not only be exposed to natural or \u201cbackground\u201d levels of IR, but also to man-made sources of radiation. Owing to a marked increase in accessibility, and an introduction of innovative techniques that utilize IR, the number of people that receive chronic and/or acute exposures to radiation via occupational, diagnostic, or treatment-related modalities, is progressively rising. Due in part to this, in recent years, much attention has been devoted to elucidate the biological responses and mechanisms underlying human exposure to IR. Ionizing radiation is now universally accepted as a severe DNA damaging agent, which can lead to serious consequences, including cancer ( Even though IR is a well-known genotoxic agent and human carcinogen, it is also widely used to effectively diagnose and treat cancer ( Ionizing radiation has the ability to affect a variety of processes within exposed cells. It can cause changes in gene expression, disruption of mitochondrial processes, cell cycle arrest, and apoptotic cell death ( The significance of long-term or so-called \u201cdelayed effects,\u201d associated with exposure to IR has become much more evident in recent years. It had long been thought that the main factor contributing to the negative biological effects of radiation in mammalian cells, such as chromosomal aberrations, mutations, and cell death, is the result of DNA damage in directly exposed cells; that is, residual damage that has not been repaired by the metabolic processes in the exposed cell ( A number of independent studies that have utilized The The first evidence for a transgenerational effect associated with IR exposure was demonstrated by Adding to the classical evidence of transgenerational impacts, the majority of recent data have arisen from various molecular techniques used to characterize genotypic alterations in unexposed offspring. Mainly, the genotypic alterations found in the progeny of irradiated parents have included chromosomal aberrations, micro nuclei formation, increased minisatellite/ESTR mutations, and altered gene expression patterns, which are all hallmarks of genomic instability ( Similarly to IR, a variety of genotoxic agents were shown to induce germline and transgenerational effects in rodent models ( In addition to genome instability and transgenerational effects, the paradigm of genetic alterations being restricted to directly hit cells has also been challenged by numerous observations in which cells that were not directly traversed by IR, but were either in the neighborhood of irradiated cells or exposed to factors produced by irradiated cells, exhibited responses similar to those of the directly exposed cells ( Evidence supporting the phenomenon of the bystander effect has been demonstrated in studies performed as early as the beginning of the 20th century. In mammals, DNA is methylated at the carbon 5 of cytosine residues to form 5-methyl-cytosines (5meC), which is established by the Consequently, it is not surprising that direct IR exposure has been reported to affect DNA methylation patterns. Consequently, the involvement of the same type of epigenetic effectors (DNA methylation, and associated proteins), in transgenerational effects induced from the paternal whole body, as well as localized cranial exposure to IR, have also been studied ( Indeed, changes in DNA methylation do not occur as isolated events, as they are closely connected to other components of chromatin structure, such as histone modifications ( One of the best studied histone modifications, especially regarding IR exposure, is the phosphorylation of histone H2AX at serine 139 (\u03b3H2AX). \u03b3H2AX is possibly one of the earliest cellular responses to DSB, and therefore, to IR exposure. The formation of \u03b3H2AX is crucial for the repair of DSB and for the maintenance of genome stability ( Recent studies have indicated that IR-induced global loss of DNA methylation can be associated with changes in histone methylation patterns, specifically with the loss of histone H4 lysine tri-methylation ( Epigenetic control can also be regulated by small RNA mediated events ( Not unexpectedly, miRNAs are also involved in IR-induced responses Recently, an additional novel small RNA pathway has begun to be characterized, providing evidence for yet another small RNA mediated epigenetic effector. Moreover, even though this novel small RNA pathway has been shown to play a role in many of the epigenetic alterations that have been observed in response to IR, no experiments have been conducted to examine the possible role and response of this pathway to IR exposure. Because this pathway is mainly restricted to the male germline in mammals, it provides a novel mechanism to facilitate paternal epigenetic inheritance of IR-induced genomic instability. Mili is detected in primordial germ cells (PGS) at 12.5 dpc, and persists during spermatogenesis up until the round spermatid stage ( The expression pattern of the third murine Piwi protein, Miwi2, is the most restricted, seen only perinatally in germ cells (gonocytes) from 15.5 dpc until a few days after birth ( In the mammalian ping-pong cycle, it is believed that sense transcripts, likely mRNAs of active transposons, represent the major substrate for primary processing (process unknown) of piRNAs that then associate with Mili ( Owing to a marked increase in accessibility and the introduction of innovative techniques that utilize IR, the number of people that receive exposure to radiation via occupational, diagnostic, or treatment-related modalities is progressively rising. The primary negative biological effects of IR have historically been accepted as direct damage to DNA. The germline-specific piRNA pathway has an established role in maintaining genome stability as it enforces the silencing of transposable elements by directing site-specific methylation during male germ cell development ( We think that the piRNA/Piwi pathway, necessary for epigenetic regulation of genome stability in the male germline, may play a role in the epigenetic alterations involved in the production/inheritance of IR-induced genomic instability. Future studies will be required to examine the effect of IR exposure on piRNA/Piwi pathway components. Analysis of Piwi proteins and sequencing of their piRNA partners will direct us in understanding the effects of IR-induced alterations to the piRNA/Piwi pathway on the epigenome. With the rate of advancement in sequencing techniques and bioinformatics we will soon be able to identify the functional targets of piRNAs, which will guide us in understanding the biological consequences of piRNA pathway responses to IR that may be linked to heritable effects associated with IR exposure (i.e., transgenerational genomic instability and carcinogenesis).", "Correlation analyses were carried out by calculating the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (r Both 5-mC and 5-hmC IR were detected in all cells, and were primarily observed as punctate IR in the nucleus. Microscopic inspection suggested a striking decrease in IR of both markers in the AD hippocampus when compared to controls ( Analyses of 5-mC IR in neurons and glial cells in the 3 hippocampal subregions revealed that AD patients had a significantly decreased level of 5-mC in glial cells in the CA3 (\u221226.9%, Analyses of 5-hmC IR in neurons and glial cells in the 3 hippocampal subregions revealed that AD patients had a significantly decreased level of 5-hmC in cells of the DG (\u221216.1%, Analysis of 5-hmC fluorescence intensity in the twins discordant for AD revealed a 31.4% reduction of 5-hmC IR in the CA1 of the hippocampus of the AD twin. Stratified analyses showed a reduction of 39.6% in the neurons and 20.7% in the glial cells of the CA1 subregion of the AD twin compared to the ND twin ( Linear correlation analyses revealed significant negative correlations between 5-mC IR and hippocampal amyloid plaque load (r Qualitative and quantitative assessment of the sections of the human hippocampus revealed an AD-related decrease of both the DNA methylation marker 5-mC and the DNA hydroxymethylation marker 5-hmC. Moreover, similar patterns of decreased 5-hmC IR were observed in the CA1 hippocampal subregion in the affected twin of a monozygotic twin pair discordant for AD. In the present study, we report that 5-mC IR, as a marker for global DNA methylation, is decreased in the hippocampus of AD patients when compared to ND controls. Pooled data from all cell-types and all regions also revealed a decrease in 5-hmC IR, reflecting global DNA hydroxymethylation. Pooled analyses showed a decrease of 5-hmC IR in the hippocampus of AD patients compared to ND controls, and stratified analyses showed that the observed changes were more pronounced in the CA3 and the DG regions. As with 5-mC IR, an AD associated decrease was the main effect, in both neurons and glial cells. Interestingly, although age associated increases of hippocampal 5-hmC have been reported ( Similar to the comparison between AD cases and controls, 5-hmC IR was diminished in the hippocampus of the AD twin compared to the ND sibling. Unfortunately, because of limitations associated with the availability of brain materials from monozygotic twins discordant for AD, we were able to examine 5-hmC IR only in the CA1 hippocampal subregion. Previous reports on the same cases have already shown decrements of DNA methylation and associated markers in the temporal neocortex of this twin pair ( There were negative correlations between hippocampal 5-mC and 5-hmC IR and amyloid plaque pathology. Moreover, a trend toward significance pointed to a negative correlation between 5 mC IR and hippocampal neurofibrillary tangle load Such findings suggest that AD pathology is associated with epigenetic changes. Representative photomicrograph of 5-mC IR (green) and the corresponding Neurotrace image (red) taken from the CA1 hippocampal subregion. Note: A loss of 5-mC IR is observed in AD cases when compared to ND controls in all 3 hippocampal subregions. Note: A decrease of 5-hmC IR is observed in AD cases when compared to ND controls in all 3 hippocampal subregions.", "Recent efforts have focused on elucidating resistance mechanisms activated in GICs in response to IR. Among these, GICs preferentially activate the DNA damage response (DDR) to result in a faster rate of double-strand break (DSB) repair induced by IR as compared to the bulk tumor cells. IR also activates NOTCH and the hepatic growth factor (HGF) receptor, c-MET, signaling cascades that play critical roles in promoting proliferation, invasion, and resistance to apoptosis. While IR provides the benefit of improved survival, it paradoxically promotes selection of more malignant cellular phenotypes of GBM. ATM and ATR are members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) family and are key regulators of DSB repair (Matsuoka et al., ATR functions in response to endogenous DNA damage; however, it may also be activated in response to DSBs induced by IR, albeit to a lesser extent than ATM. The signaling cascade activated by ATR works through a second checkpoint kinase, CHK1 (Guo et al., IR increases c-MET expression, activation, and ligand secretion in GBM (De Bacco et al., Many new drugs targeting HGF/c-MET signaling are progressing into clinical trials. Multiple c-MET pathway inhibitors are in the developmental pipeline (Liu et al., NOTCH receptor is over-expressed in multiple types of cancer initiating cells including GICs (Rizzo et al., IR induction of NOTCH activation results in an expansion of GICs (Wang et al., Currently, there are several phase I or phase I/II clinical trials examining GSIs for the treatment of patients with GBM (Table Glioblastoma initiating cells have evolved the ability to activate c-MET and NOTCH pathways after IR, highlighting the cunning ways by which GICs overcome standard cytotoxic treatment.", "We investigated whether muting IR-triggered or TNF\u03b1-dependent second-signaling feedback-dependent NF\u03baB nuclear import results in limiting IR-altered invasion and metastasis. Blocking post-translational nuclear import of NF\u03baB comprehensively inhibited both initial activation of genes (62/63, 34/42 and 65/71) triggered by IR and also TNF\u03b1-mediated second signaling-dependent sustained (59/63, 32/42 and 71/71) activation of tumor invasion and metastasis signaling molecules. Furthermore, alterations in the proteins MMP9, MMP2, PYK-2, SPA-1, Dnmt3b, Ask-1, CTGF, MMP10, MTA-2, NF-2, E-Cadherin, TIMP-2 and ADAMTS1 and the results of our scratch-wound assay validate the role of post-translational NF\u03baB in IR-regulated invasion/metastasis. These data demonstrate that IR-induced second-phase (post-translational) NF\u03baB activation mediates TNF\u03b1-dependent second signaling and further implies that IR induced NF\u03baB in cells that survive after treatment regulates tumor invasion/metastasis signaling.", "In addition, ESC quickly remove IR-induced DNA damage by using preferentially the high-fidelity HR rather than the error-prone NHEJ. Interestingly, using the resolution of IR-induced foci (IRIF) to evaluate DSB repair, hESC are shown to require ATR rather than ATM for IRIF formation and DSB repair regulation. Moreover, inhibition of DNA-PK catalytic subunit does not affect IRIF resolution suggesting that, for DSB repair, hESC rely on ATR-dependent HR . An example is provided by the hematopoietic system where, upon irradiation, human HSC (hHSC) mostly undergo p53-mediated apoptosis whereas murine HSC (mHSC), either proliferating or quiescent, repair DNA damage and survive to low IR doses. The effect on DDR of the developmental stage is shown by the response to IR of the mouse myeloid progenitors that, in contrast to mESC, mainly die due to a deficient expression of pro-survival genes such as bcl-2 . Higher levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the transient nature of DDR activation are responsible for the resistance of BSC to IR-induced DNA damage. Upon IR exposure, p53 is rapidly activated in almost all epidermal cells, but 24h after irradiation the number of BSC expressing p53 is strongly reduced suggesting that limiting the temporal activation of p53 promotes the survival of BSC after DNA damage . Adipocytes repair DSB with a faster kinetics when compared to their proliferating precursors upon exposure to a radiomimetic chemical or IR. Terminally differentiated astrocytes are radioresistant, lack functional DDR (see below) but exposed to IR retain the expression of NHEJ genes and are DNA repair proficient . DNA-PK is actually responsible for IR-induced H2AX phosphorylation in astrocytes whereas in the neural SC ATM appears to be the main responsible kinase within a canonical DDR. For instance, quiescent HSC are more resistant to IR-induced apoptosis than highly proliferative myeloid progenitor cells and ASC of the hair bulge express increased levels of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein rendering them more resistant to IR than progenitor cells . A time course analysis comparing IR-induced p53 phosphorylation in proliferating, differentiated, and quiescent murine C2C12 skeletal muscle cells revealed that this signal is impaired only in differentiated myotubes, while quiescent myoblasts are still competent to activate Ser18 (that corresponds to Ser15 in humans) phosphorylation. Several observations strongly suggest that SIRT-1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylase protein, a well known regulator to both life span and autophagy might be involved in the crosstalk between autophagy and cell differentiation. SIRT-1 modulates neuronal , adipocyte and keratinocyte differentiation. Interestingly, SIRT-1 deregulation can have opposite effects behaving as an inducer or an inhibitor of the differentiation program of keratinocytes or myoblasts and fat cells , respectively.", "Early IR-induced cardiac dysfunction can be assessed by Doppler-derived myocardial systolic strain rate (SR) index, measured at baseline and after dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE). Thirty IR patients (HOMA-IR = 7 \u00b1 5.2, age 52.6 \u00b1 2.1 years), and 20 healthy, age and sex matched controls were studied. IR had been diagnosed in all patients in the 3 months preceding the study. In contrast, after DSE a significant decrease of Delta SR was found in the IR group in comparison to the controls (0.54 \u00b1 0.31 s Our results show that IR, even if isolated and arising within a short time period, not only represents the initial phase of future diabetes, but may adversely affect heart function, as evidenced by the depressed LVCR. Our data strengthen the need for attention to be paid to IR state and for an early therapeutic approach. Diabetes mellitus has been shown to induce cardiac contractile dysfunction, which results from metabolic derangements and may evolve into a specific cardiomyopathy [ Individuals with IR are at high risk of adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death) later in life. A high prevalence of heart failure is associated with IR [ Recently, IR has been shown to predict the subsequent development of heart failure, regardless of all known risk factors, including diabetes mellitus [ On the basis of this evidence, the existence of an \u201cinsulin-resistant cardiomyopathy\u201d has been proposed [ With regard to the causal relationship between IR and cardiac function, the availability of epidemiological and clinical findings are not matched by an equal knowledge of the underlying mechanisms: alterations in hemodynamics, plasma volume, neurohormonal status, and myocardial substrate metabolism, all appear to contribute to these changes [ Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE), widely used in patients with coronary artery disease or dilated cardiomyopathy, enables evaluation of left ventricular contractile reserve (LVCR) [ Based on the hypothesis that IR might be an independent factor responsible for the development of impaired systolic function, the LVRC of a population of individuals <55 years, whose IR had been diagnosed in the 3 months before the study, was compared to that of a control group matched for age, gender and body mass index (BMI). All patients presented impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) which had been identified within the previous 3 months, and/or impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and all were affected by IR, calculated in accordance with the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) index and defined according to the values of Bonora et al. [ Inclusion criteria for both IR patients and controls were: age 20\u201355 years, echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u226555% and absence of echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities, normal hepatic and renal function (bilirubin \u22641.5 mg/dl, creatinine \u22642.0 mg/dl). The presence of dyslipidaemia or hypertension without left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy was admitted, provided that only one of these risk factors was present in any single individual in combination with IR. Two of the 32 IR patients were excluded from the study as they were positive for ischemia at DSE. With regard to the outcome of the pharmacological stress test, IR patients showed reduced longitudinal SR at the peak of drug administration as compared to controls (2.45 \u00b1 0.21 sec SR Delta SR values obtained in patients and in healthy controls. Using ROC analysis, a value of 0.85 sec There were no changes in the \u03a3 (Table The present study examined baseline cardiac performance and LVCR in middle-aged individuals (mean age 52.6 \u00b1 2.1 years) with recent recognition (2.3 \u00b1 0.8 months) of IR, without diabetes and free from cardiovascular clinical disease. We found that: The period preceding overt of type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by a state of IR and worsened \u03b2-cell function, which is clearly evident in subjects with IGT and/or IFG. In turn, IR has been independently associated with magnetic resonance measures of LV mass and LV mass to end-diastolic volume ratio, suggesting involvement in concentric LV remodelling [ Despite these important premises, our IR patients showed conventional echocardiographic parameters within normal limits at baseline. The absence of LV remodelling in these subjects can be ascribed to the very recent emergence of IR, and that the blood pressure was well controlled in most cases. On the contrary, it is well documented that long-standing IR, not countered by any therapeutic measure, is co-responsible for the development of LV hypertrophy, as well as for myocardial fibrosis, a crucial modification in the pathogenesis of a cardiomyopathy [ It is becoming increasingly evident that minor abnormalities occur in the insulin-resistant state that precedes the manifestation of overt type 2 diabetes, although IR patients were mostly investigated in the presence of co-morbidities and/or a long time after the initial diagnosis [ In the IR patients in this study, both indices of diastolic function and highly sensitive parameters of intrinsic myocardial function, such as longitudinal \u03a3 and SR, were comparable at rest to those of healthy controls. As previously stated, this baseline myocardial efficiency can be attributed to the very recent diagnosis of IR. Assuming that patients with recent IR onset are carriers of an unapparent myocardial dysfunction at baseline rest, their levels of functional coronary reserve were investigated by DSE. The presence of minor changes in systolic performance documents a functional IR-related cardiomyopathy, distinct from the diabetic morphological type, characterized by macroscopic changes, such as hypertrophy. The recognition of an early decline of LVCR in middle-aged individuals with isolated IR of recent onset is the original aspect of this study. In previous studies on this topic, older populations were recruited, IR was accompanied by comorbidities, especially obesity, and, above all, glucose intolerance was manifested over much longer time periods [ In a recent study, longitudinal contractile reserve was found significantly lower in pre-diabetic subjects during exercise. They were aged 36\u201376 years, suffered from Metabolic Syndrome and were hypertensive [ Although our results suggest that IR may act via a direct and independent mechanism, we can only hypothesize the pathophysiological basis of this effect. At the myocardial level, insulin inhibits NO production [ It is well recognized that IR can contribute to an increased risk of coronary heart disease [ Moreover, a non-invasive, repeatable assessment of coronary circulatory dysfunction, like the one employed in this study, may enable us to monitor myocardial response to corrective actions with drugs, diet and physical activity. Our results show that IR, even if isolated and arising within a short time period, not only represents the initial phase of future diabetes, but may adversely affect heart function, as evidenced by the depressed LVCR. Our data strengthen the need for attention to be paid to IR state and for an early therapeutic approach.

We examined the kinetics of DNA damage recovery in MCF7 cells that were irradiated with 4 Gy and then allowed to recover for 1 or 8 h ( The elevated basal \u03b3H2AX foci level observed in the HP1-depleted mammalian cells could be the result of apoptosis because apoptotic cells also exhibit elevated \u03b3H2AX signals ( HP1 is involved in IR-induced apoptosis. MCF7 cells and HP1-depleted MCF7 cells were untreated (upper panels) or irradiated (lower panels), then incubated for 20 h after IR-exposure.
