    "Acromine based Disambiguation of Entities From Text context. A utility for building models to disambiguate acronyms and other abbreviations of biological terms mentioned in the scientific literature. It uses an implementation of the [Acromine](http://www.chokkan.org/research/acromine/) algorithm developed by the [NaCTeM](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/index.php) at the University of Manchester to identify possible longform expansions for shortforms in text corpora. Allows building of models to disambiguate shortforms in literature based on the context in which they appear. A growing number of pretrained disambiguation models are available for download through Adeft."
